After hearing the word "mother" in association to a U.S. military weapon, Pope Francis says he was "ashamed."
According to Reuters, the Pope spoke with a group of students, telling them, "A mother gives life and this one gives death..."
The Pope continued, "We call this device a mother. What is happening?"
The device he's referring to is the U.S. military's Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), also known as "the mother of all bombs."
The Hill reports the bomb killed at least 94 ISIS fighters last month when the U.S. targeted an ISIS complex in Afghanistan.
In spite of their differing stances on many issues, Pope Francis is expected to meet with President Trump on May 24.

Not only does it look great on our stovetop, but the simplicity of its design and use is pretty unbelievable. To create coffee-shop quality espresso drinks, all you have to do is unscrew the top from the bottom, fill the bottom with water, add in ground espresso beans to the funnel, screw it back up and heat it on the stove. It only takes around five minutes all in.
To clean the Bialetti, all you need to do is run some warm water through it. Best of all, the taste of the espresso actually gets better with use, so it'll last you!

Membership is most certainly priced for the rich and famous with a $7,500 annual membership fee. That doesn't even include the terminal fee, which you have to pay every time you fly: $2,700 for up to four people. (That's $3,000 for international flights.) At least that includes free pre-flight massages and manicures.
The Private Suite experience is different from any other airport experience from the get-go. Travelers are screened by the TSA in the private terminal and don't have to deal with their baggage. A team of eight people are at your disposal, including several drivers and an airport escort.
"It typically takes 2,200 footsteps from car seat to plane seat," the website reads. "For members of The Private Suite, it's 70 footsteps. And they are all peaceful footsteps."
Instead of searching for your gate and then scrambling to buy a bottle of water and magazines to read on the plane, members can hang out in their fully stocked private suites or a shared lounge when waiting for their flight. Then, instead of lining up to board, members are driven on the tarmac straight to their plane "head-of-state style."

Just checked into my own suite at the all new private celebrity terminal at LAX. Easily the most luxurious airport experience ever! 8 people taking care of each guest, suites right next to the runway, and private BMW chauffeur to the airplane stairs. Also, private TSA and Customs lounge just for you. This is bliss! #theprivatesuite #lax
If he was actually going to catch a flight, a silver BMW 7 Series would have taken him across the tarmac straight to his plane.
The major appeal of the private plane boarding and disembarking seems to be no paparazzi, which admittedly sounds great for stars hounded by cameras.
The only problem: Those suites are going to make it hard to want to get on the plane.

A white former South Carolina police officer pleaded guilty Tuesday to violating the civil rights of Walter Scott, the unarmed black motorist he shot dead in 2015.
"The defendant used deadly force even though it was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances," the plea agreement says.
Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Scott's brother, Anthony, thanked federal prosecutors and said his family was grateful to have "justice."
"For me and my family, the healing starts today," Anthony Scott said, adding that Slager's guilty plea was a "victory" for his city, state, country and the world.
Walter Scott's mother, Judy, fought back tears as she told reporters she forgives Slager.
"I forgive Michael Slager because the forgiver is in me. That he [Slager] admitted he did it was enough years for me," she said.
Slager, 35, pulled over Scott on April 4, 2015, due to a broken taillight. Scott, 50, then ran from the traffic stop. The incident escalated, Slager has claimed, when Scott wrestled away the officer's Taser. Slager then fired his weapon as Scott ran away. Scott was struck five times in the back.
See Gallery
Slager's federal trial was set to begin on May 15, and jury selection was slated to begin May 9.
The former officer pleaded guilty to violating Scott's civil rights by shooting him with no justification — formally known as deprivation of rights under color of law. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
"We hope that Michael's acceptance of responsibility will help the Scott family as they continue to grieve their loss," Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, said in a statement. Sentencing has not yet been scheduled, Savage said.
The shooting itself heightened tension nationwide over alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement and systemic racism in policing.

According to a complaint and affidavit, On April 13th, 2017, Chesney Anne Wheeler, 38, gave birth prematurely to her daughter at 29-weeks, at her home in Williamsport. After giving birth, she told police that she took the baby out of the toilet, and wrapped her in a blanket before she passed out. When she woke up, Wheeler drove to a local drug treatment center, then to a friends with the baby's body in a cardboard box in the backseat.
She sought treatment at Wilkes Barre Hospital later that evening. At the hospital, Wheeler lied to staff about the baby's whereabouts and where she had given birth. She told staff that she had miscarried in Benton, Pa and that she flushed the 29-week "fetus" down the toilet. The hospital staff grew suspicious of a 29-week old fetus fitting down a toilet and notified police. Police later found the body in her back seat.
Wheeler admitted to police that she had given birth in Williamsport and she was afraid to take the baby to a local hospital because she had smoked crack and used heroin the night before she gave birth and was "scared they would find drugs in her system" Wheeler stated when she woke up, that the baby was limp and knew she was dead.
I wasn't thrilled about being pregnant. That's the truth" she told police.
A friend, who went with Wheeler, admitted that the two cleaned the bathroom where the baby was born and washed the towels before leaving to go to Wilkes Barre Hospital.
Wheeler is charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, obstruction of justice, and flight to avoid apprehension.
She is currently at Lycoming County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail.

Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon may be trying to make their relationship work again.
The couple, who got divorced back in 2015 after six years of marriage, have always spent a lot of time together, especially when with their children. They share twins Moroccan and Monroe, 6, and frequently post photos on social media and attend events together as a foursome. A couple week after stepping out as a family to the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, Carey and Cannon brought their twins to Disneyland for their birthday.
See Gallery
Though another insider contends that they're merely "co-parenting," the other source's claims make sense given that Carey recently broke up with her background dancer boyfriend, who she was dating for about a year after ending her engagement to Canadian billionaire James Packer.
"We're together when it counts," Carey told ET at her Butterfly MC Records launch event on Tuesday when asked about their relationship. "We're together for the kids, and I think that's the most important thing."
Back in February, Cannon welcomed another child, two-month old son Golden, with former Miss Arizona, Brittany Bell.

Gas prices are as high as they've been in more than 19 months and projected to rise further due to the impending summer driving season, according to GasBuddy. But there is some good news.
Specifically, Monday offers the lowest average gas prices, while Thursday offers the highest, based on GasBuddy's analysis of three years of gas price data. As the company notes:
"To put the amount of savings into perspective: If every U.S. motorist bought gasoline on Thursday for an entire year, they'd collectively spend an extra $1.1 billion versus filling up on Monday ..."
The best day of the week for buying gas does vary from year to year and state to state. But the study concludes that buying gas earlier in the week — as well as shopping around for the lowest price — still will save money for "many motorists."

GasBuddy, the company behind the free app of the same name, estimates that drivers can save an average of $325 per year by shopping around and using the GasBuddy app.

The app for Android and Apple mobile devices boasts "the most accurate, real-time fuel prices at more than 140,000 unique stations in the U.S., Canada and Australia," among other crowd-sourced information about gas stations.
Perhaps the easiest way to save a big chunk of change on gas, though, is by simply not paying extra for premium-grade gasoline if your car was designed to run on regular-grade gas.

The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.5% as of March 2017, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in many states the jobs that are currently available and growing are not necessarily the ones that have traditionally been available. With the economy doing relatively well, SmartAsset took a look at the fastest-growing jobs in different parts of the country.
Study Specifics
SmartAsset used Bureau of Labor statistics to find the fastest-growing job in each state (plus Washington, D.C.). We defined fastest-growing job as the job which saw the most growth in terms of raw numbers of people employed from 2012 to 2016 in each state. For more on where we got our data and how we put it together, please read the data and methodology.
Key Findings
And the winner is... – The fastest-growing occupation in the country is solar photovoltaic installer. Never heard of it? These are the people who maintain, assemble and install solar panels on roofs. This occupation only requires a high school education, as much of the training occurs on the job. Nationwide solar photovoltaic installers make about $42,500, on average.

Income inequality – There is a stark pay difference among the fastest-growing jobs in different states. The number of recordkeepers in Nevada, for example, grew 176%, but only made an average income of $27,610 in 2016. Food and tobacco roasting, baking and drying machine operators in Georgia make an average of $27,000 per year. That job grew 340% from 2012 to 2016. On the flip side, general practitioners in Massachusetts and computer and information research scientists in Michigan earn more than six figures per year, and both jobs saw the number employed more than double.
Financial examiners – People who work as financial examiners ensure compliance with financial laws. This occupation was the single fastest-growing job in three different states: New Jersey, Florida and Ohio. In fact, the occupation of financial examiner grew in every single state except for two, Oklahoma and Georgia. Only one other occupation was the fastest-growing in three different states: occupational health and safety technicians.
Manufacturing Jobs
Food batch maker was the fastest-growing job in Tennessee and food and tobacco roasting, baking and drying machine operator was the fastest-growing job in Georgia. In Mississippi, chemical plant operator came out on top, as did engine and other machine assemblers in Kentucky.
No state had an occupation grow as fast as machine assemblers grew in Kentucky. Their numbers swelled over 800% from 2012 to 2016. In 2012 there were about 170 engine and other machine assemblers in Kentucky, while in 2016 there were 1,560. This is a fairly well-paying job. It does not require a college degree and, at least in Kentucky, brings in an income of almost $40,000 per year.
Other parts of the country also saw growth in certain manufacturing fields. For example, sawing machine operator was the fastest-growing job in Pennsylvania, while in Montana it was coating, painting and spraying machine setters, operators and tenders. The only two fastest growing production occupations and state pairings which did not involve work with heavy machinery were hand sewers in Minnesota and medical appliance technicians in Indiana.
STEM Jobs
STEM jobs tend to be some of the most desired as they frequently offer high pay and have good growth prospects. On the national level, mathematics- and computer-related occupations (which is how the BLS officially categorizes STEM jobs) was the second-fastest-growing field.
In other states, STEM jobs were the second- or third-fastest growing. For example, in Nebraska, surveying and mapping technician was the single fastest-growing job but the second-fastest was operational research analysts, a STEM job. Operational research analysts grew 250% from 2012 to 2016 in Nebraska.
Other fast-growing STEM occupations include statisticians in Nevada (150% growth), actuaries in Oklahoma (133% growth) and application software developers in Georgia (86% growth).
Teaching Jobs
Teaching is traditionally a dependable occupation. Teaching-related occupations were the fastest-growing jobs in seven states. Of those seven, four – Illinois, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. – saw postsecondary teachers receive the strongest growth. In each of these states, the fastest-growing postsecondary occupation makes at least $70,000 per year.
Teaching can be a mixed bag when it comes to compensation. Preschool special education teacher is a pretty well-paying occupation, but requires quite a lot of education. On average special education preschool teachers in Connecticut make just under $70,000 and requires a college degree. Substitute teachers and library technicians on the other hand tend to make around $30,000 and require less education.
Medical Jobs 
Like teachers, medical professionals will likely always be in demand. There are eight states where the fastest-growing job is related to health care. Two states, Colorado and Wisconsin, saw massive increases in their number of psychiatric aides. Wisconsin, in particular, saw an enormous increase. In that state, the number of psychiatric aides grew by over 500% from 2012 to 2016.
Perhaps the most interesting example of growth in the health care field is the 300% growth in family and general practitioners in Massachusetts. This is a well-paid job, paying over $200,000 per year on average. Massachusetts, and especially Boston, is world-renowned for having great hospitals and medical schools, but a 300% increase in the number of general practitioners is unusual.
Phlebotomist, another healthcare occupation, was the number one growing occupation in Delaware. What exactly is a phlebotomist? For the less medically aware, a phlebotomist is the person who draws your blood for tests. Say you have an allergic reaction and you need to get a blood test, a phlebotomist would be the person helping you. The number of phlebotomists in Delaware grew 168% from 2012 to 2016. On average they make about $36,000.
Other Notable Occupations
Texas is not unique in embracing creative jobs. Commercial and industrial designing occupations in Alabama are up 214% and multimedia artists and animators saw an increase of 260% in their numbers in South Carolina. In Massachusetts and Florida, fashion designing jobs increased by over 100%.
For any true crime fans who want a career solving crimes, Kansas may be a good state to check out. Forensic science technician was the fastest-growing job here, with an increase in number from around 60 in 2012 to 350 in 2016.
Finally, when you think of jobs in New York state, you may picture investment bankers or taxi drivers in New York City and perhaps farmers in upstate New York. Turns out the fastest-growing job in the state is actually sociologists. Overall the sociology profession in New York grew 450% from 2012 to 2016. Interestingly the average income for a sociologist dropped by $23,000 from $96,330 in 2012 to $73,030 in 2016.
Data & Methodology
In order to find the fastest-growing jobs in each state (plus Washington D.C.), we looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, we looked at the number of employed people in each occupation in 2012 and compared it to the number of employed people in that occupation in 2016. We filtered out any occupation where the relative standard error for the estimate of the number of people employed in the occupation was greater than 20. We also filtered out occupations that were classified as "other." We ranked each occupation in each state by the percent growth over that five-year period.
All average salary data is from the Bureau Labor Statistics and is for 2016.

If you live in New York City—or lurk on social media even a little bit—chances are you've come across the following strange and wondrous sight: A huge, colorful arrangement of fresh flowers placed at a seemingly random location. Perhaps a larger-than-life bouquet of forsythia and sunflowers bursting from an empty city trash can. Or a mammoth garland of roses draped around a statue in Central Park.
These installations are so striking, they've likely caused you to stop in your tracks. They've also likely caused you to ponder the identity of the genius bandit behind these glorious acts.
See Gallery
"My team and I work really fast and very early in the a.m. Our call time for these flashes is 5:45 a.m., and we try to finish them before sunrise. We always recycle flowers from events when possible."
"I don't see us stopping anytime soon. These flashes are so gratifying and rewarding on many levels. There is something sort of 'Banksy-esque' about what we do, which is fun and exciting!"
"We never broadcast where our next flash will be. They just pop up randomly. We do have a hashtag that we spray by each installation: LMD x NYC. It is chalk spray paint, so it washes away in the rain. It's our way of saying #LMDWasHere."
"I can't tell you what's next, but I can reveal that we are thinking bigger and planning for that! I would love to get some funding to do these flashes on a much larger scale and reach a lot more New Yorkers. I'd also like to Flower Flash other cities. Chicago, Mexico City, Miami, Los Angeles . . . they are all on my list."
"Who doesn't love to get flowers? They are such a luxury, and New York City is a very gritty, fast-paced town. If we can bring nature—something wild and sumptuous—to New Yorkers and make them smile, the way people smile when they witness a random act of kindness, then that is a great thing. That is my goal. It's a really simple vision but powerful, I think, to try to create an emotional response through flowers."

Celine Dion can finally relax.
The price for the lavish house stood at $38.5 million at the time of the sale, though the ultimate price has not been disclosed.
That price was arrived at after a series of price chops over the last four years. It originally asked $72.5 million in 2013.
See Gallery
The singer had previously lowered the price to $45.5 million after her husband, René Angélil, died last year. Dion and her late husband bought the lot the house sits on for $12.5 million in 2005, then the adjacent mansion for $7 million in 2008. They then razed the existing home to build the current spread.
Cristina Condon of Sotheby's International Realty had the listing.

Not sure what to wear to a job interview? You might want to play it safe — and classy — and simply don black.
The survey included 180 successful applicants and 1,800 rejected candidates.
"You have to match [your outfit to] the company culture. If you show up in jeans at Citibank, it may not be well-received."
Once you make it to the job interview, it's important to make a good impression — and quickly.
It's not the usual blah, blah, blah. Click here to sign up for our free newsletter.

But before you get the opportunity to "wow" a potential employer in an interview — wearing a mostly black outfit appropriate for the work environment — you need to first pique their interest with your resume.
Keep in mind: Most companies have software programs known as applicant tracking systems (ATS) that "read" resumes before they're potentially passed on to a hiring manager.
It's important to understand how the software works so you can tweak your resume to best match what an ATS is looking for. For example, keep your resume formatting simple. Bowsher writes:
Images, special characters, fancy formatting (like tables, shading, text boxes, borders and separators) — as well as typos — can also confuse an applicant tracking system.

Two coffee shop unicorns are sharpening their horns to wage a legal battle.
Needless to say, Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino contained none of those ingredients.
Looks like 🎂🍭🍬🍦💎🍰🍩 . Tastes like 🍋🍯🌴🙃🤷🏼‍♀️💥🌈 . Made with 🌊🌿🌺🍯🍋🍈💙 . Makes you feel like ⚡️🙌👁🦄😍🤸🏽‍♀️🚀 . 📸: @shilin_cchen
However, The End claims that the Unicorn Frappuccino was too similar in outward appearance to their unicorn latte. Both drinks prominently display bright colors, pink and blue in particular.
The End also felt that Starbucks' product launch was designed to overshadow their unicorn latte, with the lawsuit also noting that The End has had a trademark pending on the drink name since January.
Image: starbucks
Starbucks, of course, stated that the accusations have no grounds. And while part of us hates siding with corporate giants, we may have to agree with them here. It's very hard to imagine that Starbucks designed both their drink and their marketing campaign to purposefully overshadow a small cafe in Brooklyn.
The drinks are also fundamentally different to their very core. Starbucks' unicorn is all about sugary sweetness while The End's unicorn attempts to help people find energy through all-natural ingredients (algae!). Because of that, these two unicorn drinks automatically target two almost completely different audiences. You drink the latte when you want to keep your good vibes going after some restorative yoga, and you drink the frappuccino when you want to treat yo'self and feel really guilty about it later.
Maybe everyone should just move on and stop the unicorn trend altogether.

May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. bobsledder Steven Holcomb, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead at a training site on Saturday, the U.S. Olympic Committee said.
Holcomb, 37, was discovered in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York, the committee said in a statement. It gave no further details.
Holcomb, who underwent successful surgery in 2008 to overcome a degenerative eye disease, made history at the Vancouver Olympics when he piloted the U.S. four-man bobsled team, nicknamed "Night Train," to the gold medal.
It marked the first U.S. gold medal in the event since 1948 and the three-time Olympian's comeback from depression over increasing blindness, according to his biography on the Team USA website.
Holcomb took bronze medals in both two-man and four-man bobsled at the 2014 Sochi Games. He also won five world titles among his 10 world championship medals and was a six-time overall world cup champion, winning 60 world cup medals.
The New York State Police, which is handling the case, had no immediate comment on Holcomb's death.
"The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb," U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun said in a statement.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and the entire bobsledding community."
Holcomb's autobiography, "But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold," had outlined how people suffering from depression should seek treatment, the Team USA profile said.
"USA Bobsled & Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend," said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Chief Executive Darrin Steele. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, N.C. and Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

Today in daily airline outrage: A husband and wife with two small children onboard a recent overbooked Delta flight were threatened with jail time after being told they could not use a seat they'd purchased for their 18-year-old son, who had instead taken an earlier flight.
Brian and Brittany Schear were flying from Maui to Los Angeles with their three children, reportedly ages 18, 2 and 1. They bought three tickets, likely thinking the youngsters would sit on the laps of the other three during the flight. But the family changed plans ahead of time, buying a ticket for their older son on an earlier flight so, as the father said, their other son would actually be able to sleep.
This did not sit well with Delta.
Because the Schear's older son never checked in for the later flight on which he was booked, the airline likely viewed it as an open seat available to a passenger not yet onboard.
The Schears bought the seat, though, and figured it wouldn't be a problem to set up a safety seat for one of their infants.

Thus, the conflict.
The video starts with Brian Schear being told that he and his wife could wind up in jail with their children in "foster care" if they didn't give up their third seat.
The situation was already tense, but it's about to get confusing, so stay with me.
At this point, a woman introduces herself and begins to explain the situation, although she doesn't appear to have a good grip on what she's explaining. Presumably an airline employee, she informs the Schears that their younger son has to be held in their laps instead of a safety seat.
"With him being two, he cannot sit in the car seat," she says, and goes on to say that this is an FAA regulation.
In fact, the opposite is true. According to an emailed FAA statement, "children two [years] of age or older are required to be in their own seat."
We've asked Delta to get on the phone with us in hopes of clearing up which employees were responsible for providing incorrect information, and why that information was provided in the first place. They haven't taken us up on it yet.
Now, it seems logical to just transfer the older son's ticket to the younger son. With a new name attached to the seat, the flight manifest would accurately reflect the actual flight, and everyone onboard could go about their business. But Delta doesn't allow ticket transfers.
After it becomes plain that the Schears won't be able to use the three seats they purchased, Brian asks whether — for the sake of finally taking off — they can just hold their kids and get out of there.
Apparently not. He's told, "it's come too far," and their options are either to go or Delta will deplane everyone.
"What are we supposed to do?" Schear asks. "I've got two infants, and my wife, we have nowhere to stay, there's no more flights. What are we supposed to do, sleep in the airport?"
Schear presses for an answer, but the (presumable) Delta employee says it's not up to her or any of her colleagues.
"At this point, you guys are on your own," she says.
"Un-fucking-real," Schear says.
Hard to disagree.

Always Dreaming has won the 143rd running of the Kentucky Derby with jockey John Velazquez.
He was the late favorite going into the race with 4 to 1 odds. Lookin at Lee and Battle of Midway came in at second and third respectively. Classic Empire, who had been another favorite in the days leading up to the race, came in fourth. 
Rainy weather leading up to the race made for a muddy track. 
The Kentucky Derby is the first race in the Triple Crown, followed by the Preakness and the Belmont. The last horse to win all three was American Pharoah in 2015.

The runaway favorite of this taste test, Classico is slightly sweet, pleasantly herby and the perfect consistency to grab onto your pasta. Our editors described it as "lovely," saying it could pass for fresh sauce, with chunks of delicious tomato and basil throughout. When you're unable to make your own, Classico is surely the next best thing.
Getty
Though not as universally beloved by our team, Barilla's Traditional sauce is a solid option for a weeknight dinner. It has a much stronger, zestier garlic taste than many of the others, and that certainly isn't a bad thing. With a smoother texture than Classico, editors found themselves liking it the more they tasted, saying, "It has character."
Getty
This jarred option immediately evoked a familiarity and nostalgia for our taste testers. It's quite sweet, which some editors loved, and has a good amount of oregano flavor, as well as a meaty texture. This sauce takes third place, though, because it tastes more like pizza sauce than a good, fresh pasta sauce. 
Getty
Our taste testers were significantly divided on this sauce, with some calling it their favorite of the bunch and others claiming it had a strange, floral herbiness. It's the least sweet of all the jars, making it the perfect purchase for those who like a dryer tomato sauce. Like Newman's, it also has a familiar taste and reminded some editors of more traditional sauces. All in all, a riskier option but tasty nonetheless.

In his recipe for goat ragù, Di Meglio uses ground goat, preferably from the leg, for a Bolognese-style sauce. The result is a rich sauce with more flavor than you would ever get with pork and beef. If you're looking for an easy introduction to the protein, using ground goat is it.
Finishing up our pickled ramps! Until next year;) Goat loin and blackberry
While you can roast the leg low and slow, once you find a good purveyor of goat, you can play around with different cuts. Izard has run goat loin on her menu, serving it with pickled ramps and blackberries.

Retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Randolph "Tex" Alles, the current head of Customs and Border Protection, was named the director of the Secret Service on Tuesday.
Alles will take over for Secret Service Deputy Director William Callahan, who has been leading the agency in an acting capacity since March 4, when then-Director Joseph Clancy retired.
Alles' selection by President Donald Trump does not require Senate approval, and it marks a departure for the Secret Service, whose leaders have typically come from within its own ranks.

The announcement was made in a brief statement distributed by the White House.
The former major general will inherit an agency that's been mired in scandals, negative press attention and low morale.

One U.S. archdiocese is cutting ties with the Girl Scouts of the USA because it apparently promotes "programs and materials reflective of many of the troubling trends in our secular culture."
Archbishop Joseph Naumann of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas said the organization is "no longer a compatible partner." 
He cited its relationship with an international scouting association that he said advocates for "contraception and abortion as preventive health care for women." He also has concerns with the Girl Scouts featuring Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan as role models because they "stand in stark opposition to what we believe."

A Jerusalem-based Fox News employee is suing the network for discrimination and retaliation, following up on a statement made to European regulators that more litigation was coming by attorney who is representing more than a dozen clients against the network.
Jessica Golloher is a Fox News Radio correspondent in the Middle East and North Africa, and says she was notified within 24 hours of requesting via email an opportunity to speak with the network's independent investigator that her contract would not be renewed upon its August expiration.
"While Fox may claim that the decision to terminate Ms. Golloher was made before she sent the email on April 17, 2017, any such defense would be preposterous given that Ms. Golloher had previously complained about discriminatory treatment and she was provided no notice or warning whatsoever regarding any potential termination," writes attorney Douglas Wigdor.
Golloher claims she was marginalized because of her gender. She had been based in Moscow in 2013, working as the network's Russia correspondent, but when the Sochi Olympic Games approached they gave the lead reporting gig to a London-based male colleague instead of her. Golloher says she was told to act as Simon Owen's Russian translator and help in his reporting.

"Aware of Fox's blatant marginalization of her skills and its decision to promote a man as the voice of Fox during the Olympics, Ms. Golloher complained throughout the Sochi events about her discriminatory treatment and the fact that she was downgraded to 'secretarial' status for Mr. Owen's purposes," writes Wigdor in the complaint.
The correspondent also claims she was bumped to the late reporting shift and forced to cover "the ridiculous and frivolous 'panty protests'" following a ban on the import of lacy underwear, instead of covering "serious and relevant" news.
In another example, set two years later, Golloher says she complained to her superiors that an anchor-producer colleague was making "relentless edits" to her scripts and treating her like a "vapid, unintelligent female reporter."
Earlier this year, Golloher says she pitched a story that would require her to go to Afghanistan but was rejected because it was "exceedingly unsafe." She claims that shortly thereafter the network sent a male reporter to cover the exact story she had pitched.
See Gallery
She says she was informed she was being terminated because of "budgetary concerns."
"Since she has been informed of her termination, Ms. Golloher continues to be excluded from work assignments," writes Wigdor. "Moreover, freelance colleagues are being given assignments that are entirely within Ms. Golloher's area of expertise despite the fact that she is still on Fox's payroll."
Golloher is suing Fox News, its parent 21st Century Fox, VP of Fox News Radio Mitch Davis and Director of News Programming Hank Weinbloom for gender discrimination and retaliation.
"Mr. Wigdor's allegation regarding his client Jessica Golloher is without merit," a Fox representative said in a statement Wednesday. "Any suggestion of discrimination or retaliation is baseless. We will vigorously defend the matter." The company has not yet commented further on the matter now that the lawsuit has been filed.

Border Patrol in Arizona found a closed casket filled with 67 pounds of weed, worth over $33,000 over the weekend.
Border patrol agents stopped the hearse in the ironic town of Tombstone for an immigration stop. Manure was put over the marijuana to cover the smell.
After noticing inconsistencies with the driver's story, a canine unit was called to search the entire hearse and the man, who is a U.S. citizen, was arrested on suspicion of narcotics and contraband smuggling.
A press release stated that: "Transnational criminal organizations use a wide range of techniques to smuggle both humans and narcotics into the United States."

In SmartAsset's study on millennial retirement, we looked at median household income in the 15 biggest cities in America. We assumed that the average millennial would save 7.5% of their salary in a 401(k) with a 4% return starting at age 27. Using those numbers, we were able to estimate the age at which millennials living in those cities may be able to retire. We based the 7.5% savings rate on Fidelity Investments' Retirement Savings Assessment study which found that's the median saving rate (including employer match) for millennials. Read the full data and methodology below for a fuller picture on how we put this study together.
As you can see the state of retirement for millennials is not bad. This simulation assumes that millennials will start collecting Social Security benefits at age 67. If millennials can manage to save 7.5% of the median income per month (including any employer match) starting at age 27, it may be possible to retire relatively early. Even in expensive cities like New York or Los Angeles, the estimated retirement age based on the scenario we laid out is 65. In cities like San Jose or San Francisco, retiring requires more savings and so the estimated ages are 69 and 68, respectively.
To be on pace to retire at 65 in cities like New York and Los Angeles, millennials may only need to save around $300 per month, on average. In more affordable cities, like Philadelphia, that number drops as low as $240 per month. Even in San Jose, the city with the highest estimated retirement expenses, to retire at 69 with an annual income of $154,267 you will only need to squirrel away $529 per month, on average. Given that the median household income in San Jose is just under $85,000, that may be possible.

Let's take a look at what would happen if, instead of spending that money paying off student loan debt, millennials were able to invest it. A millennial who owes $14,425 on a 10-year student loan at 4.66% interest rate, can expect to pay about $151 a month. But if millennials invested $151 a month into an account earning 4% per year and reinvested the earnings into the same account, that $14,425 would turn into $26,617 after 20 years. After 35 years, about the time when millennials will be considering retirement, that $14,425 would have turned into $47,936. So, you can see how detrimental a late start on retirement savings can be.
In the first scenario we assumed millennials would receive Social Security payments starting at age 67. However, since 2010 the Social Security Administration has paid out more funds than it has taken in. At current rates the Social Security Administration has enough funds to last until 2037. After that time the Social Security Administration predicts it will have enough from tax payments to pay 76% of benefits. But without some changes in how it is funded the Social Security Administration will face a severe shortfall in the coming future.
With that in mind, we were curious to see what millennial retirement would look like if millennials were unable to receive any Social Security benefits.
The results are dire. If there's no Social Security benefits and millennials are only able to save 7.5% of today's household median income in each city, a normal retirement may not be possible.
In this scenario where millennials rely exclusively on savings in their 401(k), we estimate that the average millennial living the largest cities will not be able to retire until their 80s. Our calculator assumes an end point at age 95, so in most cities our calculator estimates that without Social Security, average millennials will have about 10 years' worth of income to retire on. That means working for almost 60 years for the chance to relax for only 10.
Take Columbus, Ohio, as an example. The average millennial who starts saving at 27 and receives Social Security payments at 67, may have enough income to retire at 64. In this scenario, Social Security payments would make up $53,000 of the $73,000 total annual retirement income. In the worst-case scenario, with no Social Security payments, the average Columbus millennial might not be able to retire until 85.
For this study on the state of millennial retirement, we looked at data on incomes and expenses in each city. We plugged those numbers into SmartAsset's retirement calculator. The calculator gave us the earliest age the average person would have enough money saved to retire in each city. We ran two different simulations, one in which we assumed millennials would have Social Security benefits and one in which they would not.
Data on median household income for all 15 cities comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 5-Year American Community Survey. We used that data to estimate monthly savings and retirement expenses.
We made several assumptions for both our simulations. To find monthly savings, we assumed that millennial households would save 7.5% of the median household income. We used 7.5% because that was the median savings rate for millennials (including employer match), according to Fidelity Investments' Retirement Savings Assessment study. To find the annual retirement expenses, we assumed that households would spend 25% less in retirement than they did in non-retirement. (We calculated non-retirement expenses to be all income not put toward savings i.e. 92.5% of income.)
We assumed that residents begin saving at the age of 27, are married, had no previous money saved, place all savings into a 401(k) and, for the first simulation, start take Social Security benefits at age 67. We also assumed a 4% return on savings and an annual inflation rate of 2%. Furthermore, we assumed that households had no additional savings or retirement accounts like an IRA.
The sole difference between the two simulation is that we removed Social Security payments as a factor for the second simulation.
Finally we plugged all this data into our retirement calculator to find the estimated age at which the average millennial would have enough money saved (combined with Social Security benefits and without Social Security benefits) to meet their expenses until the age of 95 in each of the 15 biggest cities.

Key Findings
1. California
California has the highest debt-to-income ratio in the country. Residents of the Golden State make about $28,000 annually on average, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The New York Federal Reserve Bank shows that Californians have a per resident debt balance of $65,740. This gives Californians a debt-to-income ratio of 2.34 on average. Like many other states, most of Californians’ debt is held up in their mortgages. Californians owe about $51,190 on their mortgages on a per capita basis.

2. Hawaii
Hawaii comes in second with a debt-to-income ratio of 2.1. On average Hawaiians make slightly more than Golden State residents. The median income in Hawaii is $31,905 as compared to $28,068 in California. Residents of Hawaii also have slightly more debt per capita than those in California: $67,010 to $65,740. Hawaiians have the second-highest proportion of debt tied up in mortgage. In total, $51,770 out of the total $67,010 in per capita debt that Hawaiians hold is owed on mortgages. That means 77% of per capita debt is mortgage debt.

3. Virginia
Virginia comes in third with a debt-to-income ratio just below 2. The average Virginian makes about $31,557 and has $62,520 in debt. One reason why lenders may feel safe lending to Virginians, allowing them to have a high debt-to-income ratio, is their low delinquency rates. Only 1.27% of mortgage debt in Virginia is delinquent by at least 90 days. That is the 13th-lowest rate in the country. Virginia also has a relatively high proportion of its debt in student loans (7.76%).

4. Colorado
Of Colorado’s total debt, 6.85% is tied up in automobile debt. That’s the second-highest rate in the top 10. However it is quite a bit lower than the national average of 9.57%. Overall there is not much separating Colorado from Virginia: Colorado has a debt-to-income ratio of 1.96. The median income in Colorado is $31,664 and the per capita debt is $62,200.

5. Utah

6. Washington, D.C.
Almost 15% of all debt held in the nation’s capital is owed on student loan debt. All that higher education may be paying off though. D.C. has the highest median income in the country and over half of the population over the age of 25 has at least a bachelor’s degree. In fact, there are more people over the age of 25 in D.C. with a graduate degree (32.3%) than there are with only a bachelor’s degree (23.8%). The capital also has the lowest percent of debt in the country tied up in auto loans (3.35%), probably due to the accessible public transportation available in the area.

7. Oregon

8. Washington
Washington, Oregon’s northwest neighbor, comes in eighth for highest debt-to-income ratio. The state has the third-lowest percent of debt tied up in student loans (6.29%) but the third-highest percent of debt tied up in mortgages (75.35%). Washingtonians also tend to be some of the most responsible holders of debt in the country. They rank above average in delinquency rates on all types of debt and rank in the top 10 for lowest rates of auto loan delinquency and credit card delinquency.

9. Massachusetts

10. Maryland
The Old Line State rounds out our top 10 states with the highest debt-to-income ratios. Maryland residents are some of the most well-off in the country, with an average individual income of $36,316. In terms of debt, Maryland residents have $67,020 in per capita debt, meaning their debt-to-income ratio is 1.84.

Data and Methodology 
In order to find the states with the most debt, SmartAsset gathered data on total debt per capita in every state (plus Washington, D.C.) and median individual incomes in every state (plus Washington, D.C.). To find the debt-to-income ratio in each state, we divided the 2015 total debt level per capita by the 2015 median individual incomes. We then ranked each state from highest debt-to-income ratio to lowest debt-to-income ratio.
Data for total debt per capita comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Data on median incomes comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 5-Year American Community Survey.

Drone footage captured a large shark lurking beneath the water, just feet away from two surfers who were none the wiser of the big fish.
Photographer David Finlay says he was operating his drone camera at a Kiami beach in the south-eastern region of Australia this week when he first spotted the dark figure moving in the water.

They can sense electromagnetic fields.
Some neuromasts are specialized to sense other changes in the environment. These are called ampullae of Lorenzini. Each ampullae works independently to distinguish the difference in electric potential in the environment versus in the shark's body.  Scientists think that this may allow sharks to detect prey, like muscle spasms originating from an injured fish, as well as predators, and mates. It is also thought that these ampullae may be responsible for detecting the Earth’s magnetic field, helping guide sharks during migration.
Researchers are also using what they know about this system to try and create new shark repellents.

Sharks can be hypnotized.
Technically, sharks can undergo what's called tonic immobility, or a natural state of paralysis. Researchers can induce this state in a shark by either flipping the animal onto its belly or rubbing its snout, depending on which species it is. Humans aren't the only ones who know how to use this trick. Scientists think large cetaceans, like whales, may use it as well to defend themselves or prey upon sharks (instead of grabbing hold of the dorsal fin, a larger marine animal would bite it). It may also be a tactic that sharks use on each other during mating to prevent injury to the female.

They're probably color-blind.
There are at least 440 known species of shark. Among such a diverse population, it’s impossible to say for sure that all of them are color-blind. But some research suggests that many are. All animal's eyes contain two different photo receptors, sensory cells that respond to light, known as rods and cones. Rods determine the light levels that can be recognized while cones control for color. A study of 17 different shark species found that although the animals can see at a huge range of light levels, they can only see at one color spectrum: Green. This is very rare in land animals, but common in other marine species such as whales, dolphins and seals.

But sharks have a crazy sense of smell.
Sharks are able to smell one drop of blood in 1,000,000 drops (26 gallons) of seawater.
Sharks' noses can detect tiny delays in how much time a smell reaches one nostril compared to the other. They use this as a directional cue and turn towards the side that received the smell first, allowing them to stay oriented.
(Photo by Philippe TURPIN via Getty Images)
There's HUGE variety amongst shark species.
Over 400 species of sharks have been discovered so far. The smallest of all sharks — the Pale Catshark — hardly looks like the monster you may have dreamt about. This little fellow scales in at a mere 8.3 inches!
On the other hand, the well-known Great White shark can reach up to 20 feet and weigh in at over 5,000 pounds.
But even the Great White pales in comparison to the Whale Shark, which reaches lengths of nearly 50 feet (about as long as a coach bus!) and weighs an astounding 47,000 pounds.
They have a weird way of sleeping.
Sharks are animals with gills, meaning that they must have constant water flow to take in oxygen and survive. This seems like a problem since they usually achieve this by constantly swimming. But all animals must rest.
Some sharks have special organs called spiracles behind the eye that pump water over the gills even while they're sitting still. Species that never evolved to have this helpful feature find solace in taking short breaks from swimming while sitting face-first in the current to allow continued oxygen uptake through the gills. 
(Photo via Getty Images)
The only bones sharks have are their teeth.
Like all vertebrates, sharks have a skeleton. The interesting thing about sharks is that theirs isn't made of bone. 
Unlike humans, sharks have a completely cartilagenous skeleton. This is the same stuff that makes up our ears and noses. This unique difference allows sharks to travel faster — important for hunting — since they can move their bodies without the rigidity of a bony vertebrate column. In the blink of a (human) eye, a shark can turn and bite a predator lurking at its tail. 
Cartilage is also a lot lighter than bone, aiding in buoyancy, or the shark's ability to stay afloat. Finally, it is much more durable to injury, which is a necessity in the predator-filled world that is the open ocean.

In the video, the shark is seen swimming harrowingly close to a surfer whose feet are dangling in the water.
The surfer was awaiting the next wave while the shark started to swim toward him and another surfer.
Finlay is heard asking his acquaintance for a phone, presumably to warn surfers of the shark, before the short clip ends.
"These surfers were completely unaware there was a shark swimming directly beneath their feet," Finlay said. "The surf lifesavers were notified there was a shark in the water."
Last year, 17 shark attacks were unprovoked.

Aside from traditional public high schools, parents may already be able to send their teens to charter schools – public schools run by independent organizations with more flexibility to experiment with how schools operate. There are also magnet schools, which are designed around a theme, like STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – and may attract more academically gifted students via an application.

U.S. News evaluated more than 28,000 public high schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Five hundred public high schools received gold medals, 2,109 took home silver and 3,432 received bronze in the national rankings.
First, U.S. News looked at student performance on state-required tests during the 2014-2015 school year. Schools had to perform better than statistically expected on these tests in their state, given their student poverty levels, to make it to the next step. Then, schools were evaluated on whether their least-advantaged students – those of black, Hispanic and low-income backgrounds – performed at or better than the state average.
The third step required schools that passed the first two steps to have a graduation rate of at least 75 percent. Those that did made it to the final phase – which determined if their national ranking was a gold, silver or bronze medal. In this fourth step, U.S. News looked at how well schools prepared students for college based on participation in and performance on Advanced Placement exams.
The top 25 nationally ranked high schools performed equally in this phase and a new tiebreaker process was used to determine their numerical ranks. The tiebreaker looked at the percentages of seniors who took and passed AP exams in at least four different subject areas – which showed how well students were prepared for college across a variety of disciplines.
The International Baccalaureate Organization was unable to provide U.S. News with IB data as it had in previous years for the final step, so schools only using IB exams weren't eligible to receive gold or silver medals. But like all high schools that pass the first three steps of the methodology, IB schools were eligible for bronze medals.
In a new feature to the rankings, some schools with bronze medals performed well enough on college readiness to be numerically ranked within their own state.

FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Leading French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign said on Friday it had been the target of a "massive" computer hack that dumped its campaign emails online 1-1/2 days before voters choose between the centrist and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen.
Macron, who is seen as the frontrunner in an election billed as the most important in France in decades, extended his lead over Le Pen in polls on Friday.
As much as 9 gigabytes of data were posted on a profile called EMLEAKS to Pastebin, a site that allows anonymous document sharing. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for posting the data or if any of it was genuine.
See Gallery
In a statement, Macron's political movement En Marche! (Onwards!) confirmed that it had been hacked.
"The En Marche! Movement has been the victim of a massive and co-ordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information," the statement said.
An interior ministry official declined to comment, citing French rules that forbid any commentary liable to influence an election, which took effect at midnight on Friday (2200 GMT).
The presidential election commission said in statement that it would hold a meeting later on Saturday after Macron's campaign informed it about the hack and publishing of the data.
It urged the media to be cautious about publishing details of the emails given that campaigning had ended, and publication could lead to criminal charges.
Comments about the email dump began to appear on Friday evening just hours before the official ban on campaigning began. The ban is due to stay in place until the last polling stations close Sunday at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
Opinion polls show independent centrist Macron is set to beat National Front candidate Le Pen in Sunday's second round of voting, in what is seen to be France's most important election in decades. The latest surveys show him winning with about 62 percent of the vote.
RUSSIAN HAND SEEN
Former economy minister Macron's campaign has previously complained about attempts to hack its emails, blaming Russian interests in part for the cyber attacks.
On April 26, the team said it had been the target of a attempts to steal email credentials dating back to January, but that the perpetrators had failed to compromise any campaign data.
The Kremlin has denied it was behind any such attacks, even though Macron's camp renewed complaints against Russian media and a hackers' group operating in Ukraine.
Vitali Kremez, director of research with New York-based cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, told Reuters his review indicates that APT 28, a group tied to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, was behind the leak. He cited similarities with U.S. election hacks that have been previously attributed to that group.
APT28 last month registered decoy internet addresses to mimic the name of En Marche, which it likely used send tainted emails to hack into the campaign's computers, Kremez said. Those domains include onedrive-en-marche.fr and mail-en-marche.fr.
"If indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome," Kremez said.
France is the latest nation to see a major election overshadowed by accusations of manipulation through cyber hacking.
U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of parties tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to influence the election on behalf of Republican rival Donald Trump.
On Friday night as the #Macronleaks hashtag buzzed around social media, Florian Philippot, deputy leader of the National Front, tweeted "Will Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?"
Macron spokesman Sylvain Fort, in a response on Twitter, called Philippot's tweet "vile".
En Marche! said the documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but that authentic documents had been mixed on social media with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation".
Ben Nimmo, a UK-based security researcher with the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank, said initial analysis indicated that a group of U.S. far-right online activists were behind early efforts to spread the documents via social media. They were later picked up and promoted by core social media supporters of Le Pen in France, Nimmo said.
The leaks emerged on 4chan, a discussion forum popular with far right activists in the United States. An anonymous poster provided links to the documents on Pastebin, saying, "This was passed on to me today so now I am giving it to you, the people."
The hashtag #MacronLeaks was then spread by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist whose Twitter profile identifies him as Washington D.C. bureau chief of the far-right activist site Rebel TV, according to Nimmo and other analysts tracking the election. Contacted by Reuters, Posobiec said he had simply reposted what he saw on 4chan.
"You have a hashtag drive that started with the alt-right in the United States that has been picked up by some of Le Pen's most dedicated and aggressive followers online," Nimmo told Reuters.
Alt-right refers to a loose-knit group of far-right activists known for their advocacy of extremist ideas, rejection of mainstream conservatism and disruptive social media tactics.

Sarah had been sent out to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles wearing an 'Anna' costume, tasked with finding a masked 'Kristoff' on the street.
"Now to make things more dramatic, Sarah and Michael have never been on a date before," Bell said while Sarah was out searching. "Sarah has no idea Michael is asking her to prom. This could go terribly wrong, but you've got to admit it would make great TV, right?"

The teen found the character and when she brought him back to the studio, she was surprised to find her classmate Michael in the suit.
"Sarah, there's something I wanted to ask you, but I didn't know the words, so Kristen Bell is going to help me," Michael said.

Sarah interrupted at that point, giggling as she grabbed the mic and said, "Yes!"
Bell set the pair up with a limousine on the big day, as weel as a glam session to help Sarah get ready and a tuxedo fitting for Michael.
"And a case of beer! I'm just kidding about the beer," Bell quipped. "Congratulations!"

"It's a joke in the neighborhood because every year [Nolan's friend] dresses up as a Klansman and he has two black grandchildren that he loves to death," Christian Dennery, a lawyer representing Nolan, said.
The lawsuit said the Trump campaign did not dismiss Nolan because he assured them he was not racist.

Cameras captured Culkin helping the 19-year-old light a cigarette before heading to Paris Blues, a jazz club in Harlem.
The duo are said to have left the spot at about 4 a.m.
Culkin, 36, and his goddaughter have a very close bond. The actor and her father were seemingly inseparable in the early 1990s.
After the "Billie Jean" singer's sudden death in 2009, the actor was there to show support for his grieving children.
Now, with her star on the rise — she reportedly just signed a multi-million dollar deal with Calvin Klein — she'll have her godfather by her side as she handles life in the spotlight.

A 25-year-old federal program that helps finance construction projects for historically black colleges and universities could be at risk under the Trump administration.
On Friday, President Trump signed a $1 trillion spending bill. In his statement, Trump referred to the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program Account as one example of programs that "allocate benefits on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender.
He goes on to say his administration will deal with such programs "in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment."
With those words, Trump seems to be calling the constitutionality of funding such programs into question, with the United Negro College Fund issuing a statement, saying it's "puzzled" by the provision.
Cheryl Smith, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the UNCF, told Politico the program Trump used as an example isn't based on race but on "mission, accreditation status and the year the institution was established."
University of South Carolina law professor Derek W. Black cautions that Trump's statement seemingly hinting at potentially defunding programs doesn't cite any legal proof that they are discriminatory.
Black also pointed out to Politico that religion or disability weren't included on the list, wondering why only "race, ethnicity and gender" were listed in the statement.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is embarking on an ambitious early childhood education plan to make full-day preschool free for all 3-year-olds regardless of family income by 2021.
"This is going to be a game-changer," the Democratic mayor said while announcing the plan Monday at a school in the Bronx.
The plan, dubbed 3-K for All, is intended to build on the city's ongoing efforts to provide prekindergarten education to all 4-year-olds through an initiative known as Pre-K for All, which the city says has more than tripled the number of 4-year-olds enrolled in pre-K education since it launched in 2014.
"This extra year of education will provide our children with a level of academic and social development that they cannot get later on, while at the same time, alleviating some of the strain New York City's working families face today," de Blasio said.
​​​​​​"Research shows children benefit more from two years of high quality pre-K than one year," says Abbie Lieberman, an early education policy analyst for Washington think tank New America. "There's been so much attention to pre-K for 4-year-olds, but very few have expanded access to 3-year-olds."
By the fall of 2018, officials hope to have a seat readily available for every 3-year-old living in those two districts, projecting an enrollment of about 1,800 children there – triple the number enrolled today, according to the mayor's office.
Providing free, full-day early education to every 3-year-old child in the city will save families approximately $10,000 in child care, according to the mayor's office and the New York City Center for Economic Opportunity, which also reportedly estimates that 1 in 4 families who take advantage of the benefit are likely to work an average of four more hours per week, resulting in an estimated $2,400 in additional income per family.
"The benefits of early care and education programs have a clear and measurable impact on the health and wellness of children and communities as a whole," Herminia Palacio, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services, said in a statement. "By introducing 3K for All and strengthening programs in the birth-to-5 continuum, New York City is ensuring that all children, including those who are most vulnerable, get a critical boost that will positively impact their lives for years to come."
"I'm happy to see they are implementing it a little more slowly than Pre-K for All," she says. "This would allow for more thoughtful implementation. Scaling up too quickly can jeopardize quality, and that was a big concern for Pre-K for All."

Mark Green, President Donald Trump's pick for Army secretary, withdrew his nomination Friday amidst criticism over his controversial statements about Islam, transgender rights and gay marriage.
Opposition to Green's nomination mounted over the last week, with multiple groups criticizing his controversial remarks and record.

"If you poll the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease," Green also allegedly said in September.
Green, a Republican state senator in Tennessee and former Army medic who did three tours in Iraq, rejected the criticism, saying that the "liberal left has cut and spliced my words about terrorism and ISIS, blatantly falsifying what I've said," CNN reported.
A number of US senators also called on President Trump to choose someone else. Most were opposed due to some of Green's controversial past comments.
Green said in a statement that those who opposed him were using "false and misleading attacks."
Trump's first pick for Army secretary was business executive Vincent Viola. He withdrew his consideration in February because of his financial holdings.

The federal budget in 2016 was $4 trillion, so $54 billion would be just about 1.35 percent of the budget that year.
Nonetheless, the number is really too big to fully comprehend, so to make it more manageable, here's what "We, the People," might get for $54 billion in defense spending. For the sake of comparison, we're going to throw in what we could do with that amount of money in non-defense spending, as well.
The U.S. plans to buy 2,457 of the planes.

Alternatively, the $54 billion could be applied to purchasing ammunition for one of the Zumwalt’s super high-tech guns. At a cost of $800,000 per shell, we could buy 67,500 of those.
The 5.56 mm round is most commonly used in the M-16 rifles, M-4 carbines and M-249 machine guns. According to U.S. Army budget documents, they cost $34.9 million in 2015, a figure that includes the standard ammunition used in training and combat, along with tracer rounds, test rounds and other types. The purchase is meant to procure ammunition to be used that year, along with some extra to maintain a war stockpile. At that rate of purchase, $54 billion worth would last 1,547 years. (Of course, that doesn’t account for the bullets used by other branches of the military.)

Kids go through all kinds of interesting stages in life. I find it interesting, and a bit entertaining, that my 7-year-old is now in that state where he's having conversations with his friends about more than just toys.
I can understand many of the reasons why parents start paying their child an allowance. It can help:
However, something inside me just wasn't buying it. I decided not to give my child an allowance for now. Here are 3 reasons why along with what I opted to do instead.
Right now, there's not a ton that my 7-year-old can do around the house. My husband and I do the cooking and cleaning. All my son needs to do is pick up his toys after himself, and make up his bed each day.
I've tried teaching him how to hang up his clothes and vacuum a bit, but he's not doing these things on a regular basis. Regardless, all of these chores listed are things he can do to help out and contribute to the family.
I don't think he should get paid for normal things he does around the house since because that could set him up for unrealistic expectations later on in life. My husband and I don't get paid to cook dinner and clean up the house.
My child is in a stage right now where he's interested in having money – to buy toys I'm guessing. He's not necessarily interested in doing his chores and helping out around the house. He's just looking forward to what's in it for him.
I actually see that as a bad sign. I don't want my son to be motivated to do things just for money.
There are many other benefits that come from doing chores and cleaning up, like having a neat home or room to enjoy, and avoiding clutter and pests that may show up when there are a ton of crumbs around.
I fear that if I start paying my child an allowance this early, he may not be motivated to help out and clean in general in the future if money isn't involved. It's important to teach my son that cleaning up is a natural habit that everyone should be happy to do regardless of if they're getting paid or not.
Some parents may argue that paying your child an allowance can help them learn about money. Without having money of their own how can they learn how to manage money properly? I don't entirely agree with this mindset.
Right now, I know that my son wants money so he can buy extra toys (that he doesn't really need). My husband and I get him plenty for Christmas and his birthday, and my mom gets him things occasionally.
Sure, I could probably give him a small allowance. Then I could teach him how to save a portion of the money instead of spending it. But, I can also teach him how to budget for real life expenses too.
I'm planning on giving him a budget for his birthday party next year. I'll let him pick everything out so I can actively show him how much things cost. I can also teach him about budgeting while we shop for food in the grocery store instead of just doing everything myself.
We can also discuss saving up for college. Plus, I really want to get him a stock gift card for Christmas so I can introduce investing.
Instead, I'm willing to give him money for going above and beyond my expectations. For example, if he were to get straight As in school in future years. I'm also okay with helping him collect spare change that's found around the house as an attempt to 'grow his savings'.
My husband and I are really bad about leaving spare change around and doing absolutely nothing with this. A few weeks ago, we decided to allow our son to put some of the spare change from around the house into his bank.
Quarters are off limits because we tend to use those for washing our clothes. But, as long as I approve it, anything else is fair game for his piggy bank. My hope is that collecting spare change will teach my son how to be resourceful in future years. He'll understand that all money is valuable and can add up.
Right now since my child has very few needs and plenty of time to learn more about money. I feel like this is the best solution for us.

A single conversation could be all you need to spot a psychopath.
1. They speak in the past tense. 
(PhotoAlto/Eric Audras via Getty Images)
(Bloom Productions via Getty Images)
3. Their language lacks emotional dimension.
For psychopaths, saying, "I love you," doesn't stir up any more emotion than saying, "Please pass the milk." They can parrot back what they've heard other people say but their facial expressions don't match their words. Their ability to verbalize feelings is most likely a learned behavior, as opposed to a genuine emotional experience.
(Fabrice LEROUGE via Getty Images)
Researchers have found that psychopaths talk more and use more emotional words in an attempt to gain attention and admiration. Psychopaths are really good at saying just the right thing at the right time. They know how to play on other people's emotions and they're master manipulators.
(Tom Merton via Getty Images)
5. They speak slowly and quietly.
Studies show psychopaths usually speak in a controlled manner. They don't emphasize emotional words like other people do. Their tone remains fairly neutral throughout the conversation. Researchers suspect they craft a calm demeanor intentionally because it helps them gain more control in their personal interactions.
(Ridofranz via Getty Images)
6. They talk about life in terms of cause and effect.
7. They focus their attention on their basic needs.
Rather than talk about spiritual or emotional needs or the needs of others, psychopaths are more likely to talk about their own basic needs, like food and shelter. A psychopath who confesses to a murder, for example, is more likely to spend the bulk of his time talking about what he ate for lunch and what he hoped to gain financially, rather than how his behavior affected other people.
8. They say, "um" more often.
9. They're great storytellers.
Whether a psychopath claims she rescued kittens from a burning building or says she was the only one at her last job who was willing to stand up to management, psychopaths tell rich stories about themselves. While some stories are likely to paint them as victims, the bulk of their stories are likely to portray them as heroes. All of their stories stem from their desire to gain trust and manipulate their listeners.

How Likely Are You to Talk to a Psychopath?
Before you start declaring everyone around is a psychopath, know that only about one in 100 people is likely to be one--unless you're talking to people in prison. Some experts estimate up to 25 percent of prison inmates may be psychopaths.
If you encounter a psychopath, don't panic. Most of them aren't serial killers. In fact, some of them are successful CEOs and business leaders. But knowing whom you are dealing with can prevent you from being manipulated.

Are you considering putting your home on the market? 2017 is turning out to be a great year for home sellers.

But remember to be realistic and respectful when asking an agent to drop their fee. Lewis explains:
It's not reasonable to ask a full-service agent to drop her fee to the level of, say, a discount brokerage like Redfin. If you can negotiate a discount of one entire percentage point, you've done great.

For the purposes of our study younger millennials are adults between the ages of 16 and 24 and older millennials are adults between the ages of 25 and 44.
The median household income for young millennials in San Francisco is $49,078. The marginal tax rate for single tax filers in California who earn between $40,773 and $51,530 is 8%. Combined with federal taxes, this results in a total estimated tax bill of $10,737.

9. San Jose, California
On average, a young millennial in San Jose pays more income taxes than his or her peers in San Francisco and Los Angeles. That’s because the median household income in San Jose for young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 ($49,595) is higher than it is in other major cities across the state of California. A typical young adult in San Jose who earns the median income pays $1,707 in state and local taxes and $9,240 in federal taxes.
8. Baltimore, Maryland

7. Aurora, Colorado
Aurora ranks seventh on our list of the places where younger millennials pay the highest taxes. Five-year estimates from the Census Bureau’s 2015 American Community Survey report that the median household income for 16- to 24-year old residents in the city is around $41,826. This means that a single filer earning median income can expect to pay about $7,417 in federal taxes and $1,937 in state and local taxes.

5. Virginia Beach, Virginia
Virginia Beach could be the perfect place to live if you like being in close proximity to the ocean. But if your income falls on the higher end of the spectrum, prepare to end up with a hefty tax bill. The federal effective tax rate for young millennials who earn the median income in Virginia Beach is 10.41%. Combined with state and local tax rates, that rate climbs to 22.7%, resulting in an estimated tax bill of $10,173 overall.
(SherryVSmith_Images via Getty Images)
4. Portland, Oregon
The median household income for a millennial between the ages of 16 and 24 is about $34,002, according to the Census Bureau. And while Oregon residents don’t have to worry about paying sales tax, many single filers face a steep marginal income tax rate of 9%. Based on our calculations, we found that a young millennial earning the median income in Portland can expect to pay about $5,645 in federal taxes and around $2,332 in state and local taxes.
(DaveAlan via Getty Images)
3. New York, New York
New York City is another city that’s notorious for its high tax rates. Our study reveals that a young millennial earning median income in the Big Apple (the average income across all five boroughs, based on population) would pay an overall effective tax rate of 24%. That adds up to about $9,138 in federal, state and local taxes.
(mikdam via Getty Images)
2. Chesapeake, Virginia
Census Bureau data reveals that the median household income for young millennials in Chesapeake is around $64,695. As a result, they have some of the highest tax bills among their counterparts nationwide. Our analysis shows that a young Chesapeake millennial earning median income will pay about $14,170 in federal taxes and around $3,227 in state and local taxes.

1. Arlington, Virginia

Our analysis reveals that six cities in our study (San Francisco, San Jose, Honolulu, New York, Arlington, Virginia and Portland, Oregon) rank as places where younger and older millennials pay the highest taxes. Older millennials also have high tax bills in six other cities, including Washington, D.C., Oakland and Fremont, California.
In terms of the cities where older millennials have the biggest tax burdens, we also had a three-way tie for 10th place. In Irvine, Santa Ana and Anaheim, California, older millennials who earn around $81,917 (the median household income for adults between the ages of 25 and 44) can expect to pay about $19,793 in federal taxes and $4,607 in state and local taxes.
Washington, D.C.
Oakland, California
Income tax rates in the state of California vary widely based on income. The poorest residents pay a marginal tax rate of 1% and the wealthiest residents face a marginal rate of 12.3%. In Oakland, the median household income for adults between the ages of 25 and 44 is nearly $90,500. Adults who earn the median income pay an overall effective tax rate of 30.9% (with federal taxes included).
Fremont, California
Fremont is located roughly an hour away from San Francisco, by car. The average older millennial earns around $90,499 per year and has a combined effective tax rate of 30.9%. That adds up to about $28,000 in federal, state and local taxes.
We made several assumptions throughout our study. For example, we assumed that a millennial would take the standard deduction and file taxes as a single filer claiming one exemption (meaning that he is not married and has no children). We also assumed that a typical millennial wouldn't make any pre-tax contributions to a 401(k) or another retirement account.

There isn't much North Korean media, but what little exists is full of images of nuclear destruction — of U.S. cities incinerated by North Korean nukes. News anchors promise that a coming conflict will leave Washington in "a sea of fire." A Communist party website warned Tuesday that Pyongyang is "waiting for the moment it will reduce the whole of the U.S. mainland to ruins."
North Korean propaganda has gotten so over-the-top that after that last headline, the Chinese urged the Koreans to pipe down. The Chinese Foreign Ministry suggested both the North and the U.S. should "remain calm and exercise restraint, stop irritating each other," which experts said was directed more at Pyongyang than D.C.

It all sounds very ominous, but is it? While the tempo of anti-U.S. rhetoric is higher than in past years, there hasn't been that much of a change in its content. As one U.S. intelligence official noted, there's always been "hyperbole and propaganda in their messaging."
In fact, say experts and U.S. officials, most of the rhetoric so widely replayed in Western media is not meant for the world stage but for internal consumption in the "hermit kingdom."
Still, at least one expert on North Korean propaganda said that while a lot of Pyongyang's rhetorical flourishes are "eminently mockable," they shouldn't be ignored.
1. While Kim Jong Un's birthday on January 8 is a national holiday, it is unknown exactly how old the North Korean leader is. It's widely believed he is in his early-mid thirties. In 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department listed his birth year as 1984 when they placed sanctions on North Korea.

Rodman has visited the secluded nation multiple times and even sang him "Happy Birthday" before an exhibition game in Jan. 2014.

5. Kim Jong Un's older half-brother Kim Jong Nam was killed in Feb. 2017 by two women who smeared VX nerve agent on his face at an airport in Kuala Lumpur. The women were arrested following his death. Many believe the hit was directed by North Korea.

"Their bluster now carries more weight," said Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo Korea Foundation Professor in Korean Studies at the Fletcher School. "We can patronize them, but when their ability to carry out such attacks gets close, when they show the technology, I think their threats become more credible."
Lee also said that outsiders "should not be reduced to patronizing a regime that is very cruel."
A second U.S. intelligence official said the recent increase in noise is about attention.
"They need it," said the official, noting they weren't getting it from the Obama administration. "So they've been pounding out stuff at a sustained pace for at least a year."
See Gallery
And the messaging can get even more personal. Lee points to attacks on President Obama and the recently impeached president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, in 2015. Obama, he said, was referred to as a "wicked black monkey" who should return to Africa "and feed off bread crumbs thrown by tourists" while Park was called a "dirty old whore." The North, Lee said, received criticism in the international community for its racist and sexist commentary.
Some of the more recent videos directed against the U.S. have high production values, with heavy use of graphics and animations.
One U.S. official said the videos are at once a throwback to earlier Cold War messaging and strangely au courant. He called them "almost post-modern, ironic rather than earnest."
There is a numbing sameness to North Korea's words and imagery, but the U.S. monitors the messages closely for any changes. As a second U.S. official said, if the Koreans stop talking about turning South Korea into a "sea of fire" and threaten something even more horrific, the intelligence community — and the world — need to take note.

Beyonce is setting the record straight on a report speculating that she got a cosmetic procedure done while pregnant with twins.
"What do you know about the effects of pregnancy on a woman's entire body? Please tell me," the statement reads, addressing the staffers at the website directly. "Did you know that in addition to weight gain there is often a dramatic change in the blood flow in the system and increased fluid causing swelling? Do you know that often women's gums get swollen? Do you know that it sometimes affects our speech, our ability to chew intently and a host of other things?"

"But the sacrifice to our faces, our feet and our entire bodies is something we welcome because we bring beautiful humans into the world who will one day combat your hate and negativity," the statement continues. "I stood silent during Beyonce's first pregnancy when you thought it was okay to bully her like the cowards you are, when you accused her of never being pregnant, but I simply cannot this time."
The statement ends with some even harsher words. "You are the saddest individuals and picking on a pregnant lady is tantamount to possessing the coldest, despicable heart," Noel-Schure says. "You need to find something else to do with your time and maybe stop by a store that has happiness on sale because you need to buy some.

Our daily life can be hectic and sometimes we long for convenient ways to save time and do less. Unfortunately, seeking convenience too often can cause you to overspend quite a bit.
Saving money is very convenient too and much better for your wallet and your financial goals. By planning ahead using savings strategies, we can save money on many daily purchases we tend to make and enjoy convenience in most cases. Let's put more money back into our pockets by saving money on these 50 common expenses many people tend to pay regularly.
Take a bit of extra time to withdraw money from your bank's ATM and save on the cost to withdraw your own cash or if your bank has a mobile app, use it to find an in-network ATM near you.
Many of us like to keep our loose change in a jar and let it collect over time. Once it's full, don't pay machines to count it for you, go to your bank to deposit your savings or have it exchange for cash.
Skip the line at the currency exchange or grocery store and pay online using checking account or debit card. Some companies charge to use a debit card, so schedule e-check payment, which is typically free.
Maintaining a balance on your card usually you to pay interest each month. Try to pay off your credit card balance in full each month or send more than the minimum payment. As always, use your credit cards responsibly.
I Raised My Credit Score By 150 Points, Here's How
Although it may be convenient, prices are always marked up when compared to other stores. So take the time to shop for food in advance at your grocery store and pack emergency snacks in your car.
Some vehicles may not require premium gas, which is the most costly of the gasoline grades. Stop trying to be fancy, check the owner's manual, and save.
You may not know this, but having low tire pressure affects your mileage significantly. Save gas and money by improving your gas mileage by simply checking your tire pressure and maintaining it at the proper level.
Many car wash places offer a flat monthly rate for unlimited washes, so check with your local car wash to find out if they offer a monthly rate and cash in on a clean car. Or, you can get a discount when you pump your gas.
According to the Powerball, the odds hitting the jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338.00, and CNN cites that Americans spent $70.15 billion in 2014. Let's save our hard-earned money.
A daily cup of joe adds up if you purchase it at places like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. Save by brewing at home.
It's a tough addiction to beat, but it is a very expensive to purchase cigarettes daily. Aside from causing deadly health effects, according to Time, smoking can cost you $1 to $2 million in a lifetime. Make an effort to better your health and wallet.
If your area doesn't charge for using plastic bags, reuse the ones you get from shopping as garbage bags. I do this all the time.
For those living in an area where stores charge for plastic bags (*cough cough Chicago*), bring your own reusable one. Those cents add up!
Reuse bags from previous occasions if they are still in good condition. We started doing this last year and no longer have to run out and by $3+ gift bags when we go to events or parties.
Take some time to make your own personal cards or send an eCard and skip on the expense.
For the frequent traveler, you should buy empty travel containers and refill with shampoo, lotion, etc. as needed.
Save money and paper by keeping up with free online news services.
In the digital age of music, don't pay for premium services. Streaming companies like SoundCloud and Spotify allow you to listen to music for free.
If you'd like to truly own a book, then save on the paper and extra cost by purchasing the digital version, or go to your local library and check them out for free.
Remember to return all materials on time. It'll save you money and allow for other library patrons to enjoy the material in a timely manner. If you do have library fees, wait for a month when they accept canned goods as a payment method (usually around the holidays).
Skip the early release and commotion of having the latest video game. Save major bucks by purchasing a used version of the game online or at stores like Game Stop.
Gaming apps are meant to entertain, and while most of them are free, don't fall for the "purchase bonus lives" trap. In-game purchases add up.
If you forget your charger and your phone needs to be charged, some time you'll be inclined to purchase a new one, but it can be costly or even poor quality. Always keep your charger handy, look for a charging station where you're at, or simply ask to borrow one.
Save on disposable batteries and purchase rechargeable ones. They can last up to two to three years.
Many offices, banks, insurance companies, etc, give them away for free. Save them and skip on the purchase.
Unless you're a student, you probably don't really need to buy a lot of paper – reuse already printed pages and use both sides.
While some families "grow into" their homes, sometimes less is more. Save on mortgage and the possibility of purchasing more for a larger home. Downsize and save.
If you pay for water utility bill, according to the EPA, fixing leaky faucets saves you 10% on your bill. By ignoring it, you not only lose money every day it goes unfixed, but you also waste clean water, at a rate of 10,000 gallons per year.
Save on heating and electric bills by fixing drafts and keep the warmth and cool in your home during the winter and summer.
Even though you may not use them often, electronics that are plugged in still consume energy. Unplug appliances you don't you often and keep other electronics on a power strip, turning them off when not in use.
Improve your health and wallet by not eating fast food often. It may be cheap, but it adds up, especially if you eat out a few times per week. Instead, spend the money and the time to grocery shop and prepare meals.
Sometimes you're running late for work and don't have time to pack a lunch. Buying lunch often costs much more than preparing and bring a meal to work. Spend some time planning, purchasing and preparing meals ahead of time so they're ready to go, even when you're in a hurry.
When you do go grocery shopping, sometimes the already-prepped sub or diced fruits and veggies tempt you to buy them and save time, but you'll be paying top dollar for those products. Plan a list ahead of time and buy the individual food items, then spend the time prepping them yourself in order to save.
Save money by skipping on the brand names, like medicine, toiletries, and certain foods. Remember that healthier options with fewer additives may cost more and in that case they may be worth it. Otherwise, generic is the way to go.
Products like toilet paper and soap have a long shelf life, so save on purchasing those often and buy in bulk.
You are purchasing these to eventually throw them out. Save on the waste and save money by buying reusable, washable towels and napkins. Your wallet and the environment will thank you.
Primetime showings are typically 2x higher than those during the day. Go to morning matinees or take advantage of weekly specials ($5 movie nights during the week).
Often times, movie theater food can cost more than the ticket to get in. Try to keep food purchases to a minimum when you can or eat a filling meal before you go see a movie.
Instead of spending money on purchasing the movie, subscribe to streaming services and find an alternative or go to your local library.
While having a spontaneous night out is fun, if you RSVP when possible, arrive early, or take advantage of online ticket sales, you can skip out on paying in full at your favorite nightlife places.
Your birthday is one of the best days to score free stuff like meals, drinks, desserts, tickets, services, etc. I wrote a whole roundup post on birthday freebies a while ago.
When you do dine out and if you have kids with you, be sure to take advantage of 'kids eat free' specials. Most restaurants have specific days of the week when they offer free kids meals.
You may not be able to cut out this expense completely if you have pets, but you can score free cans of pet food with coupons occasionally so you won't have to spend as much.
As you can see, there are many ways to save big on everyday expenses. How do you plan on cutting back and keeping more money in your wallet?

Matus and DeVoursney, a former Marine from Georgia, were found dead Monday in Belize. Authorities in the Central American country have named 54-year-old John Deshaies as the prime suspect.
But the friend of the suspected killer says police have the wrong man. The friend said Deshaies, the owner of a Canadian construction company, would never harm Matus.
The friend believes police targeted Deshaies because he left the country shortly after Matus and DeVoursney went missing.
Deshaies lived in the lower half of Matus' home in Belize. Matus, 52, was a Canadian real estate investor and split her time between Belize and Canada.
"Belize is a very corrupt country," the friend said. "I think they're actually keeping him in jail for his own safety. They want it to seem like it's a Canadian or American problem rather than a Belizean one."
DeVoursney, 36, and Matus, who had only been dating for a few months, were last seen alive at Scotty's Bar and Grill in Corozal. They were found dead in a field near the village of Chan Chen a week after they disappeared.
It was determined that Matus and DeVoursney had been strangled.

That doesn't mean some — like Bill Maher — aren't ready to lob some criticism, not necessarily at Kimmel but more at the ideas he presented. Thankfully, it has nothing to do with Kimmel's situation with his son — it would take a real heel to criticize that on television — but Maher does take exception with Kimmel's assertion that all sides land along the same lines on basic healthcare. When Kimmel says Republicans and Democrats all agree that "If your baby's going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make," Maher stops his audience from applauding and proceeds to rant:
"Unfortunately that's not true, One side wants to tax rich people so that babies don't have to die and one side is mostly against that. And this lets Republicans off the hook...
"Let's not f*ck around with this, we are not on the same page with this."
See photos of Bill Maher:
See Gallery
Maher sprinkled healthcare talk throughout Friday's show, kicking things off with a monologue that made fun of the celebration in The White House rose garden and saying that the GOP told Jimmy Kimmel's baby "go screw yourself." It also led to Maher dropping a New Rule that called out the folks who characterized the 2016 election as a "choice between the lesser of two evils." He includes plenty of other examples from Trump's first 100 days, including his many questionable cabinet positions, and proceeds to lecture all of the major names that seemed to put Clinton in the same basket with Trump.

Former first lady Michelle Obama recently revealed a surprising behind-the-scenes look at how her daughters decided to spend their last moments in the White House.
After enjoying a long vacation with husband and former president Barack Obama in the Virgin Islands, Michelle Obama returned with her first official public appearance since the Obamas left the White House three months ago at the American Institute of Architecture conference.
See Gallery
There, she shared how Malia and Sasha Obama -- 18 and 15 respectively -- bid farewell to their home of eight years. According to the first lady, they hosted a slumber party with friends, pizza and chicken nuggets.
"They had a sleepover, because of course on Inauguration Day, because my girls are so normal, they're like, 'Well, eight girls are gonna be sleeping here because it's our last time, and we want pizza and we want nuggets.' And it's like, really?," Michelle Obama said during the Thursday conference.
In reflecting on the girls' last night before Trump's inauguration, Obama said it was difficult for the girls to say goodbye to the White House.
"So that moment of transition, right before the doors opened and we welcomed in the new family, our kids were leaving out the back door in tears, saying goodbye to people," Obama said.
Obama joked that she had to maintain good face while welcoming the Trump family into the White House.
"I didn't want to have tears in my eyes because people would swear I was crying because of the new president," she said.
Obama also shared a funny note when reflecting on the Obama family's life outside of the White House.
"Friends are surprised I answer the door now," she explained, while also sharing that the Obama family's two furry members, dogs Bo and Sunny, have never even "heard a doorbell."

Ah, summer, you've been missed. We've been, er, itching for warmer days, weekend getaways and patio barbecues. Our days are soon to be exploding with afternoon happy hours, days on the lake, outdoor concerts and time with family and friends. If you couldn't tell, we cannot wait for summer to officially start.
Although most POW cases have been reported in the Great Lakes and Northeast, everyone should know how to protect themselves from ticks. From the type of socks to wear to the types of flowers to plant, here's how you can protect yourself.
1. Stay in the middle of the path
When hiking, make sure to stay in the middle of the path. Weeds, grass and trees make it easier for ticks to crawl onto you. Don't venture out to the grass or bushes, where ticks are formidable to be hiding. 
2. Wear long pants and closed toed shoes
Protect your skin. Adding an extra layer makes it more difficult to latch on to you. It's smart to wear pants, long sleeves and hats, especially in the summer.
3. Invest in deer-resistant plants. 
7. Stay in the sun.
5. Yes, repellant can help. 
4. Check your dog! 
Dogs can literally bring ticks right to your front door. Prevent ticks by keeping their coats short in the summer. Use your hands to check the fur, stopping if you feel a pea-sized bump. Favorite spots ticks like to hide include the ears, toes and under the tail. 
6. Dry your clothes 
Warning: Ticks can survive the wash. 
8. Tuck your pants into your socks.
This covers the small, easily accessible space in between your pants and ankles. Especially if you are sitting, it makes it easier for ticks to latch on. 
9. Invest in Permethrin socks
10. Mow your lawn
Cut your grass, clean your yard, get rid of any extra firewood or wood chips.

At 23 years old, zookeepers say an African elephant named Seeni is expecting and due this summer. Seeni was rescued from Botswana, along with two other females, and the handlers have been waiting for her to get pregnant.

Pittsburgh Zoo staff are thrilled at the news as her calf will be the first born at the facility since it opened in 2006. Even with good news, keepers say Seeni's is a high-risk pregnancy.

Tiny homes might seem ideal for those seeking a quieter, quainter lifestyle.
But imagine a tiny home being thrown in the middle of all the madness that is downtown Las Vegas — in the backyard of one of the most infamous party hotels, no less.
Though it might not be the source of rest and relaxation that most crave from tiny living, if there's anywhere to try something completely unorthodox, it's certainly Vegas!
The room boasts one bedroom with a queen-sized bed, a lofted full-sized bed and a pullout sleeper sofa, which allows the place to comfortably (questionable) sleep six guests.
See Gallery
If you're still not sold, get this — the home essentially doubles as a private "island" in the middle of an all-night party.
The structure is set up in "The Backyard" courtyard property of the Gold Spike hotel (the hotel's penthouse was the suite featured on MTV's "Real World" Season 31) which is essentially an adult dreamland — giant yard games like cornhole and Jenga, a music stage and of course, a bar.
"During the day, The Backyard is relatively tame. At night, however, the area can get downright rowdy—and the Sugar Shack is right in the center of the action."
Renting the Sugar Shack also means gaining access to a private front yard, essentially enabling VIP access to all of the festivities going on around you.
The countless windows and open air vibes of the structure always make you feel like you're the center of the party, even when you're just hanging out inside — and isn't that what most come to Vegas for, anyway?
Goes without saying that all guests must be 21 or older.
It's definitley not for the faint of heart, but for those wanting a through and through Las Vegas experience, this might be as close as you'll ever get — you truly never have to leave the party.

Big-box stores and warehouse clubs like BJ's, Costco and Sam's Club are a shopper's dream -- One-stop shops where you can buy a lifetime supply of your favorite foods and products. However, don't let every gargantuan carton and low price tag tempt you. Tons of items are better purchased in a 2-pack rather than a 24-pack.
1. Cooking oils
Cooking oils like olive oil and vegetable oil typically have shelf lives of only 6-12 months -- so stay away from the gallon-sized containers. 
2. Spices
While spices don't expire quickly, they tend to lose their potency after about 6 months. If you want to buy spices in bulk, stick to buying whole cloves and grind them up yourself to maintain those bold flavors. 
3. Liquid bleach
Bleach has a shelf life of about 6-12 months. The chemical begins to degrade immediately, especially at higher temperatures, so don't be tempted by the bigger packages.
4. Face cream and sunscreen
Lotions like moisturizer and sunscreen  tend to lose their effectiveness in about 3-6 months -- so stick to purchasing smaller bottles and restock a few times a year. 
5. Condiments
Condiments like ketchup, ranch dressing and mayonnaise are laden with preservatives to hold a longer shelf life -- but even so, it's usually 6-12 months. There's a good chance you won't finish your bottle before the expiration date, so stick to buying one bottle at a time. 
6. Brown rice
Brown rice deteriorates much faster than white or pre-cooked rice. Even when stored in an airtight container, brown rice only has a shelf life of about 6 months. 
7. Soda
Properly stored canned soda has a shelf life of about 9 months, but it may lose some carbonation and taste.
See Gallery
Be cautious in the cooking aisle. Cooking oils have a much shorter shelf life than you probably realize (only 3-6 months!) and ground spices lose their potency after about 6 months. White rice and other pre-cooked rices reportedly have a shelf life of 30 years -- but did you know brown rice expires after only 6 months?
Besides the obvious grocery staples that perish quickly -- like dairy products, produce and meat -- there are some other products to avoid buying in large quantities that you may not be aware of.
Hit up the grocery store instead for the above items -- or just stick to smaller packages.

No more Twitter for Kanye.
"He's focusing on getting back into the public spotlight really slow," a source told ET earlier this week. "That's the main reason why he didn't want to go to the Met Ball. He's still very close friends with Anna and loves her dearly, but right now it's all about him and staying healthy."

"He was thrilled that Kim was able to go and have fun," the source said. "But him staying at home with his children was something he wanted to do more."
Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian West, did go solo to the event, where she rocked a subdued white outfit, and confirmed her husband's absence from the event.

According to Allard, drug paraphernalia and prescription medication was located in the home near McNeely's body. There is no indication of foul play, however, Allard says there were signs of illegal drug use. McNeely's body has been transported to the West Virginia Medical Examiner for autopsy.

More than one-third of Americans say President Donald Trump is influencing how and where they decide to open their pocketbook.
"We may have lost at the ballot box, but we can vote at the cash register every day. I'm going to continue to reach out to these companies to let them know I'm not doing business with them until they sever their relationship with the Trump family."
Twenty-six percent of those who participated in the CNBC poll say they've made a political or charitable contribution based on Trump, CNBC reports, noting that "the vast majority" of those contributions are in opposition to the president.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Boko Haram militants have released dozens of schoolgirls out of a group of more than 200 whom they kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok in April 2014, officials said on Saturday.
A government minister, asking not to be named, said 82 girls had been released. Unconfirmed reports on social media put the number of freed girls at between 50 and 62.
"The girls were released through negotiations with the government," one official said, asking not to be named, adding that an official statement would follow shortly.
A military source said the girls were currently in Banki near the Cameroon border for medical checks before being airlifted to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.
The kidnapping was one of the high-profile incidents of Boko Haram's insurgency in Nigeria's northeast, now in its eighth year and with little sign of ending. About 220 were abducted from their school in a nighttime attack.
More than 20 girls were released last October in a deal brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Others have escaped or been rescued, but 195 were believed to be still in captivity before this release.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said last month that the government was in talks to secure the release of the remaining captives.
Although the Chibok girls are the most high-profile case, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of adults and children, many of whose cases have been neglected.
The militants have killed more than 20,000 people and displaced more than 2 million during their insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria.
Although the army has retaken much of the territory initially lost to Boko Haram, large parts of the northeast, particularly in Borno state, remain under threat from the militants. Suicide bombings and gun attacks have increased in the region since the end of the rainy season late last year.

A furry suspect caught on camera holding what appeared to be an assault rifle was lucky after escaping police by a whisker.
An Oregon resident alerted police after spotting a cat holding what appeared to be a firearm in its paws while posted up in a tree.

Police rushed to the scene to answer the bizarre call after receiving an image of the feline suspect toting the alarming object.
Once they arrived, law enforcement officials soon realized the photo of the would-be gangster puss was nothing more than an optical illusion.
The cat snapped in the photo was actually holding a tree branch that just looked a lot like a weapon, and the Newport Police Department reacted in style.
In a post on Facebook, the department wrote they issued the animal a "verbal warning."
Reports of an armed cat this morning were unfounded. The feline was contacted by our canine and was determined to be in...

Paying taxes on Earth is already a pain, but in California, you could one day be paying that extra fee in space. The state's franchise tax board wants the public to weigh in on the idea.
Its proposal would compute taxes on commercial space transportation companies. Basically, any company operating in California that makes half of their money from space transportation. They say it is any travel 62 miles above the surface of the Earth.
Alabama residents pay less in property taxes than residents in any other state due to low median home values and the second-lowest property tax rate. Alabama residents have 23.66 percent of income going toward taxes, with a median household income of $44,509.
Arizona falls in the bottom half of states for total taxes paid by its residents, who see 24.58 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes. Property taxes and gas taxes paid in this state are lower than the national average.
Arkansas has one of the highest sales tax rates in the nation, at 9.3 percent. However, residents pay less in income taxes and gas taxes than the national average. Plus, the average property tax bill in Arkansas is among the lowest in the nation due to low median home values and a low tax rate.
California residents pay more in taxes than residents of most other states. In fact, 31 percent of their income, on average, goes toward taxes. Considering that the cost of living in California also is high, it's no wonder it's one of the states where residents are most likely to live paycheck to paycheck, according to one GOBankingRates study.
Colorado residents pay more in taxes than the national average of $14,998.83 — and pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes, on average. The reason: high income and sales taxes. Gas and property taxes paid in Colorado, on th other hand, are lower than the national average.
Connecticut residents pay more in income taxes than any other state, in part due to a high median income of $72,889. Average property taxes paid in the state also are about double the national average of $2,118.08. In addition to high taxes, residents also are faced with a high cost of living in Connecticut.
Delaware is one of the most tax-friendly states, with residents paying just 21.99 percent of their income toward taxes. One of the key reasons the total tax bill is low here is because there is no sales tax. Plus, the average property tax paid is nearly half the national average.
Washington, D.C., residents pay more in property taxes, on average, than residents in most states due to a high median home value of $540,400. Residents also pay more in income taxes, on average, than any other state, with the exception of Connecticut.
On the plus side, the sales tax rate of 5.75 percent is below the national average. Residents also pay less than the national average to fill up their gas tanks.
The total taxes paid in Georgia are lower than the national average of $14,998.83. However, taxes actually consume a higher percentage of residents' income than the national average because of a low median income of $50,768 in the state.
Hawaii residents have to pay a hefty tax bill to live in paradise. Total taxes paid are among the top 10 highest in the nation — due, in large part, to high income taxes. Residents earning a median household income of $64,514 pay around $14,798.36 in income taxes.
On the plus side, property and sales taxes in Hawaii are lower than the national average.
Total taxes paid in Idaho — $14,012.17 — are slightly below the national average. However, residents pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes than the national average due to the state's low median income.
Hefty property and sales taxes contribute to a high total tax bill in Illinois. In fact, the average property tax bill is more than 50 percent higher than the national average — even though the median home value is below the national average. Overall, Illinois residents pay nearly 30 percent of their income, on average, toward taxes.
Indiana is a relatively tax-friendly state. The average total tax bill is lower than the national average because income and property taxes are lower in Indiana than in most other states.
Average property taxes paid in Kansas are relatively low due to a less-than-stellar median home value. Average income taxes paid also are below the national average because of the state's low median wage. However, Kansas residents are hit by a high sales tax, which is 8.62 percent versus the national average 6.47 percent.
Kentucky has the fourth-lowest average tax burden in this study. All taxes paid — income, sales, property and gas — are well below the national average. Income and property taxes paid are particularly low, on average, due to the state's low median income and property value.
Average property taxes paid in Louisiana are among the lowest in the nation, as are income taxes due to the state's low median income of $45,922. Further, Louisiana has a higher-than-average sales tax of 9.98 percent.
Total taxes paid in Maine are lower than the national average. But that doesn't mean residents don't face high taxes. Total taxes paid consume nearly 27 percent of residents' pay, on average, due to the state's low median income.
Maryland residents pay more in taxes than residents in all but three states. This is largely due to the high income taxes paid in this state, which has the third-highest median income in the nation.
Michigan's property tax rate is higher than the national average. However, a low median home value helps keep down the average property taxes paid in the state. Income and sales taxes paid also are lower than the national average.
On average, nearly 30 percent of what Minnesota residents earn goes toward income, property, sales and gas taxes. Average income taxes paid are particularly high, compared with other states.
Mississippi residents pay the lowest total tax bill in the nation. Income taxes paid here are the second lowest in the country due to the state's low median income of $40,037. Plus, property taxes paid are among the lowest in the nation as a result of a low tax rate and median home value.
The total tax bill in Missouri is only slightly higher than the national average of $14,998.83, due to income and sales taxes that are higher than the average paid nationwide. However, property and gas taxes in Missouri are well below the national average paid.
Montana is just one of four states with no sales tax. Property and income taxes also are lower than the national average. As a result, Montana residents see just 22.28 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes.
The total tax bill in Nebraska is higher than the national average. In large part, it's because residents pay more in income taxes as a result of a higher-than-average median income. Nonetheless, residents pay, on average, an amount equal to about 28 percent of their income.
New Hampshire has no sales tax. It also doesn't have a state income tax, but the average amount of federal income taxes paid by residents is high because the state has the highest median income in the nation. Residents also pay more in property taxes than the national average paid. In fact, New Hampshire has the second-highest property tax rate in the U.S., after New Jersey.
New Jersey residents pay the highest total tax bill in the nation. They also pay the highest percentage of income toward taxes — 33.17 percent, on average. The biggest reason the tax burden is so high in New Jersey is the state's 2.13 percent property tax rate, which is more than twice as high as the national average rate.
Total taxes paid in New Mexico are among the lowest in the nation. Property and income taxes paid are well below the national average. This is due, in large part, to a low median income and a low median home value in the state.
Like their New Jersey neighbors, New York residents pay more than 30 percent of their income toward taxes. Residents pay a lot on the state's high sales tax of 8.49 percent and property tax of 1.38 percent.
The total tax bill in North Carolina is lower than the national average thanks to lower-than-average property and income taxes. However, residents pay more in gas taxes.
North Dakota residents have a lower total tax bill than the national average, paying around $13,381.61 every year. Gas and property taxes are lower than the national average, too.
Although the property tax rate in Ohio is higher than the national average, property taxes paid fall below the national average due to the state's low median home value of $125,300. Ohio residents also pay slightly less in income taxes overall, forking over just under $9,000 annually.
Oklahoma has one of the lowest total tax bills in the nation. Income and property taxes are well below the national average because median income and the median home value are among the lowest in the U.S. However, residents are hit by a high 8.86 percent state sales tax.
Oregon is just one of four states without a sales tax. Still, residents pay just over 28 percent of their income toward taxes. They face a high income tax bill.
Rhode Island residents pay over 29 percent of their income toward taxes. The big tax bite is due primarily to the state's high property tax rate of 1.51 percent. Income and sales taxes, on the other hand, are on par with the national average.
South Carolina's total tax bill is among the lowest in the nation. Residents pay below-average income, gas and property taxes. Its sales tax, however, is above average at 7.22 percent.
South Dakota has no income tax, which helps keep residents' total tax bill below the national average. Property and sales taxes paid also are slightly below the national average.
Tennessee has no state taxes on income, but it makes up for it with a high sales tax rate of 9.46 percent — the second highest in this study. The average property taxes paid, on the other hand, are half the national average.
The overall tax bill in Utah is higher than the national average due to high income taxes paid by residents. However, the state does offer a high median household income of about $66,000. Meanwhile, the state's property tax rate is just 0.64 percent, compared to the national average of 1.02 percent.
Vermont residents pay more in property taxes than residents in most other states. As a result, total taxes paid in this state nearly top $18,000, far higher than the national average.
Virginia residents have a higher income tax bill than the national average, paying just over $12,600. But it's due, in part, to the state's median income, which is higher than the national average. Sales, gas and property taxes are all lower than national averages.
Washington has no income tax. However, residents are liable to pay a lot in income taxes thanks to the state's high median household income of $67,243. The state sales tax is also high, at 8.92 percent.
The total tax bill in West Virginia is the second lowest in the nation, after Mississippi. The typical property tax bill is also the second lowest in the nation, due to the state's low property tax rate of 0.53 percent and a low home value of $102,400.
Wisconsin residents pay a higher overall tax bill than the national average because of the state's high income and property taxes. In fact, Wisconsin is among the top 10 states that take the most out of your paycheck.
Residents of this tax-friendly state pay only about 20 percent of their income toward taxes — the lowest percentage in the nation. Wyoming has no state income tax, and property and sales taxes in the state are well below national averages.

Now, the reason the board created the rules is to let entrepreneurs know the state's tax code will be ready once business takes off. And, figuring out the amount of tax is actually pretty simple. The farther away from Earth you go means the less tax you pay. While the closer you are means more tax.
A public hearing on the rules is set for June 16th.

Cyrus says making the change was "easy." "When I want something, it's f–king easy for me," she said. "But if anyone told me not to smoke, I would have not done it. It's because it was on my time. I know exactly where I am right now."
Though she made this decision to quit "for a second" for herself, she was motivated in part by the people around her.

I want to be super clear and sharp because I know exactly where I want to be."

Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd said that the C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, is set to become the new star of its 600-plus aircraft fleet, stating that its "safety and state-of-the-art design will bring superb a flying experience to its passengers".
In a written reply to China Daily, the Shanghai-based airline, which is expected to be the first carrier to take delivery of the homegrown single-aisle passenger jet, said it was "extremely confident about the future of the C919".
China Eastern pre-ordered 20 C919s from the aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd in 2010, and according to the purchase agreement, negotiations for the ordering of the first five planes will be launched within a year of the C919's maiden flight.
China Eastern is one of the nation's top three airlines, serving more than 100 million passengers in flights to 177 nations and regions in 1,062 destinations every year.
ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, the subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, announced its intention to purchase 45 C919 aircraft in October 2011. ICBC Financial Leasing is looking to support COMAC with joint marketing, market surveys, signing more orders and all-around financial services in the future, said Xu Qing, deputy CEO of ICBC Leasing.
"C919 will serve the most attractive market. The aircraft will be used in the domestic market, the Asia-Pacific region and the African market in its early days. By continuously optimizing the aircraft's performance, the C919 will go global in the future," said Xu.
With regard to the two dominant commercial aircraft makers－Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE－she suggested the future C919 should pay more attention to service at the beginning to build up its brand first.
"It's important to pay attention to customer support and services, and enhance product quality and stability. Overseas marketing should be based on continuously optimized products and services, an efficient maintenance support, and efficiency of operations," said Xu.

A visitor poses for a photo on the glass bridge, in August. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
Editor's note: During the just-concluded May Day holiday, "glass paths" became the new buzzword in the tourism sector. Two experts share their views with China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang on the mushrooming of glass-bottomed walkways over gorges in scenic spots across China.
Are the 'glass paths' worth the trouble?




Glass-bottomed bridges were first built between two cliffs so that people could enjoy the scenery around while being aware of the scary depth of the ravine below. For example, in Baishi Mountain Geological National Park in Baoding, North China's Hebei province, a 95-meter-long, 2-meter-wide glass-bottomed walkway was built at an average altitude of 1,900 meters to allow visitors to experience the beautiful but stomach-churning scenery below.
The problem is that glass-bottomed walkways have mushroomed across China. Search glass-bottomed walkways on domestic tourism website tuniu.com, and you will find that 24 cities have built such "glass paths" as their tourist sites. And since a majority of the "glass paths" have been built across valleys bereft of natural beauty, one cannot but question the wisdom to build them.
The rush to build "glass paths" shows the officials in the domestic tourist sites lack creativity. Instead of using the inherent advantages of the tourist sites, they are busy copying ideas and examples from others. Such homogenization fails to meet tourists' diversified demands.
More importantly, the glass needed for the glass-bottomed walkways is expensive and the total cost of such a bridge can run into several million yuan, and some tourist sites may fail to earn enough revenue to cover the expenses, let alone make profits, which would be a waste of tourism resources. And any compromise with the quality of the glass or the overall glass-bottomed bridge could spell trouble.
Liu Simin, vice-president of tourism at Beijing-based Chinese Society for Future Studies
Such bridges need total safety system
No major accidents have been reported from glass-bottomed walkways. And many tourism sites claim double-or multi-layered armored glass, which is three to four times stronger than ordinary glass, have been used to build such walkways.
But good safety records do not necessarily guarantee safety in the future. There is a national standard for the glass used in outer parts of structures (as a curtain wall for a building for example) but no special standard for the glass used in glass-bottomed walkways. I do not mean to raise unnecessary alarm, but without a national standard no one can ensure safety forever on the "glass paths".
Besides, people tend to equal the risk with glass-bottomed bridges to the cracking of glass and people falling into the ravines. But that is not the only risk.
On April 9, the overcrowding on a glass-bottomed bridge in Mulanshengtian tourism zone in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, amidst heavy rainfall caused an accident in which one person died and three were injured. The incident should be a lesson for us. Regular safety checks must be conducted to test the strength and durability of such walkways, while the maintenance and supervision staff should be fully trained to know under what conditions the walkways should be closed and how to deal with emergencies.
Besides, not everybody is fit to walk on such "glass paths", because looking down into a deep ravine might raise a person's blood pressure, increasing the risk of a heart attack. In fact, several reports have said tourists started crying out in fear on such walkways. The tourist sites with such walkways should therefore display clear safety instructions so that visitors know the risks and people with unfavorable health conditions stay away from them.
Only a comprehensive safety system can ensure tourists' safety on glass-bottomed bridges.

WITH THE PRICE OF GARLIC SPROUTS plummeting due to oversupply, some farmers in Henan province have reportedly discarded their harvest of garlic sprouts, a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Thursday:
The local governments in Henan have acted quickly to the overstock by pledging to set up a garlic association to nip oversupply in the bud. But what happened in Henan indicates once again how easy it is for farmers to fall prey to price fluctuations.
That some have urged the market to play its part at the cost of "non-market minded" farmers is hardly helpful. Farmers do not necessarily have to pay the price for being unaware of how the market works and when they should increase or reduce their production. Local agricultural officials are obliged to intervene if need be and guide farmers through these dark waters, rather than sit on the sidelines.
The roller coaster price alterations of Chinese agricultural products can be devastating to farmers, yet they are not uncontrollable.
Home to a relatively mature and stable agricultural market, the United States can offer a lesson or two on balancing supply and demand.
The food produced by one US farmer can feed about 155 people, and one-fifth of the country's food products are exported to the rest of the world. In recent decades, the US has rarely suffered from an excessive supply of soybeans, oranges, or milk thanks to its efficient supply chain, at the core of which is its agricultural cooperatives.
Cooperatives enable farmers to own and control, on a democratic basis, the procurement of supplies and services, and the selling of their products.
This should be heeded by many local governments in China, which either step back letting the market take over or improvise countermeasures such as initiating emergency buying in the face of an oversupply. Neither approach is a cure to the problems facing Chinese farmers.
The nationwide promotion of cooperatives seems to have yet to reach Henan's local governments, which only began discussing the possibility of establishing a garlic association after farmers threw their hard-earned harvest away.
Establishing online exchange platforms could also better prepare farmers for unexpected market changes.

PARIS - The French electoral commission, which supervises the country's presidential race, on Saturday warned local media not to republish data and information hacked from centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign staff.
In a statement, the commission asked media not to report the content of the leaked documents on their websites, stressing that publishing false information would be punished under criminal law.
Late on Friday, Macron's campaign team said it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
The leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, it added.
However, the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation," according to Macron's En Marche! (On the Move!) party.
The alleged hacking of the leading political party in the presidential race came on the eve of the election's run-off on Sunday.
Pollsters predict Macron to beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen with large margin.
In February, Macron's staff said their campaign had been the target of cyber attacks targeting databases and e-mail servers.

Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia, on Wednesday.Alexander Zemlianichenko / Reuters
SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions."
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back".
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors.
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being.
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions.
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership."
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.

A total of up to 20 billion yuan could be paid at the provincial level as bonuses
Beijing will offer rewards to nine provinces that exceeded their capacity cut targets in 2016, financed by a portion of the 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) subsidy allotted to help address overcapacity, Xu Hongcai, assistant finance minister, said on Friday.
Rewards for good performance will facilitate overall progress in cutting overcapacity this year, but less-developed areas that face greater difficulties with economic restructuring also need more financial help, experts said.
Local governments and enterprises in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will receive money for going beyond capacity cut targets in the steel sector. Chongqing, and Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces will receive grants for cuts in the coal sector, Xu said.
"The final amount given to each province will be revealed after the central government verifies the performance of each province last year," Xu said. "We will make sure that the allocation of money is transparent."
The total amount of the rewards would amount to a maximum of 20 percent of 100 billion yuan in special funds established in 2016, Xu said. The remaining 80 percent would be allotted to all regions to help with capacity cuts, he said.
Xu did not provide details on when the amounts will be announced or how the money will be spent.
"The central government's financial support is vital in helping the province achieve the capacity cut target because relocating workers and business restructuring are very costly," said Ji Jinghang, curator of Hangzhou Low-Carbon Museum in Zhejiang province.
Zhejiang's developed and balanced economy allows its laid-off workers to find jobs more easily than those in less-developed places such as in the economically lagging northeastern region.
Zhejiang ranked 14th nationwide in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017, with an 8 percent year-on-year growth rate, while Jilin province, saddled with heavy capacity cut targets, registered 2.4 percent growth during the same quarter.
Zhejiang plans to cut 2 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2020, while the target set for the steel sector this year alone in Jilin is 800,000 tons, according to provincial government documents.
Cheng Gong, a senior China National Coal Association analyst, said economically lagging regions need more financial support from the central government than last year because local governments face higher pressure to achieve targets.

Students from Guangxi University of Science and Technology play with pupils in Tantou township, Liuzhou city, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in July. English, dancing, painting and calligraphy classes were held for the pupils during summer vacation. Tan Kaixing / for China Daily
The pupils are watched by tens of thousands of people nationwide. It reminds us of the movie The Truman Show, where the main character lives in an artificial mini-world where he is watched by a worldwide audience around the clock.
The difference is, at the end of the movie Truman escapes from the artificial world in which he has been living, but the pupils are still being watched by audiences nationwide even though the media has exposed the voyeurism.
Legally speaking, school authorities that install cameras in classrooms and dormitories and provide video to live broadcast websites violate pupils' rights, because they invade the children's privacy without their consent.
According to reports, some of the schools argued they obtained consent from the pupils' parents when installing the cameras. The problem is, even though the pupils are minors they have the right to their own privacy, and so the consent of their parents is not valid. More important, the schools did not tell the parents that videos would be provided to live broadcast websites to be streamed nationwide.
Some "experts" have even claimed the pupils are attending a class and classrooms are public areas, so such broadcasts are not infringing on their privacy. Such opinions are nonsense because they totally ignore the pupils' legal right to privacy and the fact that classrooms are not public spaces to which everyone has the right of access.
China has been constantly improving the rule of law and made many achievements in the past few years. But it seems, teachers and schools need reminding they must respect the legal rights of their pupils. If the pupils realize their privacy and legal rights are being violated in such a way, how can they trust the rule of law?

China National Chemical Corp, also known as ChemChina, said on Friday that shareholders of Syngenta AG, the Swiss agrochemical and seed producer, have accepted its $43 billion takeover bid, paving the way for completion of China's biggest international acquisition deal.

Based on preliminary numbers, 80.7 percent of shares were tendered in favor of the acquisition, higher than the minimum acceptance rate of 67 percent needed for the deal to go through, ChemChina said in a statement

The first payment settlement is scheduled for May 18.

The Chinese company plans to delist Syngenta's shares in Switzerland and the United States at an appropriate time.

"The completion of this deal will help ChemChina become one of the world's largest suppliers of pesticides and other crop-care chemicals," said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing.

However, Ding said Dow Chemical Co's merger with DuPont Co and Bayer AG's purchase of Monsanto Co, which occurred in the past two years, would continue to provide intense market competition with ChemChina, as the top six international suppliers including Syngenta and BASF SE, have all been vying for market share and financial resources to push research and development of new products.

Zhang Xiaoping, director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said China could use Syngenta's deep experience and resources in intellectual property, risk control and environmental management to bring its products to global markets.

"On the other hand, Syngenta will have better access than other global companies to sell its products in our domestic markets," said Xu Hongcai, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.

"China's pesticide industry is riddled with low profitability and only global scale can improve that."

The government pins high hopes on the reform to solve structural issues in the agricultural sector, where some agricultural products are oversupplied while others rely heavily on imports.

China has been encouraging its companies to use both domestic and global resources to ensure the country's grain and food security in its agricultural policy.

Niu Dun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said earlier this year that the deal would generate a positive outcome for China to upgrade its abilities in grain and food production, supply chain building and processing.

Syngenta has 28,000 employees in more than 90 countries and regions. Its sales revenue dropped 1 percent year-on-year to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017.

Beijing-headquartered ChemChina possesses production, research and development, and marketing systems in 150 countries and regions. Materials sciences, life sciences, high-end manufacturing and basic chemicals are its main businesses.

It also acquired nine companies in France, the United Kingdom, Israel, Italy and Germany.

Two Chinese geological parks were approved on Friday to enter the Global Geoparks Network established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The two parks, Arxan National Geopark and Koktokay National Geopark, are located respectively in northwest China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Arxan National Geopark in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region is characterized by its landscape of volcanoes and hot springs and a large variety of lava formations, such as rocks and volcanic crater lakes.
Koktokay National Geopark is located in the Altay Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It has a large area of mining pits, with deposits of over 80 kinds of minerals. The park is also well-known for the granite landscapes and an earthquake fault zone.
A total of eight geoparks were approved to enter the network on Friday, with the others scattered in Spain, France, Iran, Mexico and South Korea. The new approval raises the total number in the list to 127.

James passes Abdul-Jabbar mark as Cavs crush Raptors
CLEVELAND - Unstoppable. Untouchable. Undefeated.
Back on the playoff stage, where he's starred so many times before, LeBron James is making things look easy.
James scored 39 points, passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time career playoff scoring list and pushed the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 125-103 blowout over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday night.
Just like a year ago in the conference final, the Cavs are up 2-0 on the Raptors, who had better figure some things out or this series will be over quickly.
Toronto was blown out for the fifth straight time in Cleveland in the playoffs, losing each by an average of 24.2 points.
Game 3 is on Friday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre.
James, who has won a road game in 27 consecutive series, appears determined to toss Toronto aside. He finished 10 of 14 from the field, dropped four 3-pointers and 15 free throws.
"He did miss six free throws," cracked Toronto's Kyle Lowry. "He's playing unbelievable. He's playing like LeBron James."
In Cleveland's past nine playoff wins, James is averaging 34.9 points, 10 rebounds and 8.1 assists.
Kyrie Irving had 22 points and 11 assists and Channing Frye scored 18 points for the reigning champions, who are 6-0 so far defending their title. Cleveland is 9-0 since losing Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals.
The Raptors didn't start Jonas Valanciunas, but he led them with 23 points. Toronto only got five points from All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who didn't make his first field goal until the first minute of the fourth quarter.
Of bigger concern might be the status of Lowry, who sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. He scored 20 points but spent the fourth quarter in the locker room icing his ankle.
"It's pretty sore," Lowry said after limping to the postgame podium. "I'm going to get treatment and get ready for Game 3."
James came in needing 25 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, and he overtook the Hall of Fame center with a 3-pointer in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped the Cavs open a 26-point lead.
James (5,777 points) now only trails Michael Jordan (5,987), the player to whom he has been compared since he was a teenager, for the most points in postseason history.
James is also trying to match Jordan's six titles. He's halfway there, and the way the Cavs are playing, he could have No 4 before long.
Raptors coach Dwane Casey promised the Raptors "would be a different team tonight coming out".
He started a smaller lineup, benching the 7-foot Valanciunas and forward DeMarre Carroll in favor of guard Norman Powell and forward Patrick Patterson.
Casey also moved Serge Ibaka from power forward to center.
The moves were intended to give Toronto more ball handlers and open the floor on offense.
They didn't work, simply because the Raptors couldn't contain James.
Casey, though, is confident his team can go home and even the series.
"I believe in our players," he said. "I believe in our guys. I know there is another level we can get to. I've seen it before."
It won't matter if James raises his, too.
Milestone
James also became the fourth player with 300 career 3-pointers in the postseason, joining Ray Allen (385), Reg-gie Miller (320) and Manu Ginobili (312).
On his 40th birthday, coach Tyronn Lue said the best gift would be a win. But the former NBA journeyman, who won two titles and played for seven teams, reflected on the milestone.
"A little kid from Mexico (Missouri) with just dreams and hopes," he said.
"You never thought it would come true, but I worked hard and I'm here and I'm just blessed."

Swiss President Doris Leuthard speaks during an interview with Xinhua in Bern, Switzerland, on Jan 12, 2017. She is expected to attend the Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15. [Photo/Xinhua]
GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.

BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.

Higuain brace has Italians eyeing Cardiff
MONACO - Gonzalo Higuain urged his Juventus teammates to keep their feet on the ground after he scored both goals in a brilliant 2-0 win in Monaco on Wednesday that left the Italian squad on the brink of the Champions League final.
Argentine striker Higuain was set up by Dani Alves to open the scoring in the 29th minute, then converted an Alves cross just before the hour as Juve claimed a crucial victory in the semifinal first leg at Stade Louis II.
The Italian champion has the final in Cardiff on June 3 in its sights, with a showdown against holder Real Madrid, Higuain's former side, looking probable.
"The dream we have been pursuing since August has been to get to Cardiff and we are just one step away," said Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season following his $98 million transfer from Napoli.
"We have not won anything yet, so we mustn't get carried away," added Higuain, who ended a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages.
"I stayed calm. I knew everyone had faith in me and that hard work is always rewarded in the end."
Juventus shone in all areas against a Monaco side that has lit up Europe this season with a thrilling brand of attacking soccer.
Buffon still strong
But the host found Juve's defense rock solid, with Gianluigi Buffon majestic as ever in goal.
The 39-year-old, making his 149th European appearance, denied Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao in the first half and produced a stunning fingertip stop on Valere Germain late in the second.
Juventus, which welcomes Monaco to Turin for the second leg next Tuesday, has now gone over 10 hours without conceding in the Champions League and Buffon has blanked the opposition in five matches in the knockout rounds.
"In every game I want to show that I deserve to play at this level despite my age," said Buffon, twice a losing finalist in the Champions League.
"I work hard every day for this. The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it.
"We had the right approach. They are a fearsome team and the only way to beat them was playing the way we did."
Buffon also praised coach Massimiliano Allegri for his decision to bring Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defense, thwarting Monaco's attack and allowing Alves to wreak havoc down the right.
"Gigi showed that he is still a great goalkeeper. He always does it in big games, and Higuain scored two lovely goals," said Allegri.
"But to get results, everyone needs to work hard. You need to make sacrifices and track back and he did that too."
'More clinical'
Juventus could wrap up a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this weekend, when it faces city rival Torino, while Lazio awaits in the Italian Cup final.
To put its performance in the principality into context, Monaco had won its previous 13 home games and scored in 41 consecutive matches at Stade Louis II since November 2015.
"They were more clinical than us - with two or three chances they scored and we couldn't put any of ours away. Buffon made some incredible saves," said Monaco head coach Leonardo Jardim, who sorely missed injured marauding leftback Benjamin Mendy.
Now Monaco must attempt to become just the third team ever to overturn a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League.
"It is difficult, but we need to keep believing. The best thing is to believe it is possible, even if we only have a five percent chance," Jardim added.
In the meantime, Monaco will switch its focus back to its attempt to win the French title.
It plays Nancy on Saturday and needs two wins from its last four league games to become champion.

As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.

Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."

China's foreign trade is expected to sustain an upward trend in the near future, as more export-oriented companies focus on developing new levels of competitiveness, according to the spokesman of the nation's biggest trade event.
"Chinese exporters are no longer manufacturers focusing on intensive production and lower pricing to compete in the global market," said Xu Bing, spokesman of the Canton Fair.
The Canton Fair－held twice a year and known as the China Import and Export Fair－concluded on Friday in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou with reported total transactions at the spring fair increasing by 6.9 percent year-on-year to 206.357 billion yuan ($30 billion).
"Development of new competitiveness－including technology, brands, quality and services－is reasons behind the increased transactions for Chinese exporters," said Xu, also deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
There were 196,490 overseas buyers from 213 countries and regions visiting the fair, a rise of 5.87 percent year-on-year.
"We can see that more companies participating in the Canton Fair displayed products with higher quality and design, which offer high added values and are more competitive in the global market," Xu added.
The spokesman said more companies were attaching importance to innovation and building overseas branding and sales centers.
Transactions at the brand exhibition areas during the fair increased by 16.9 percent year-on-year to $10.9 billion, accounting for 36.3 percent of the total.
Su Cheng, general manager of Taizhou Chenghao Machine Mould Co Ltd, said Chinese homegrown moulds, which are of high quality with competitive prices, had also been sold to developed markets.
"The demand for Chinese moulds has been increasing recently in developed markets, which are traditionally powerhouses for high-quality industrial moulds," said Su.
According to Su, the company's moulds have been sold in major markets like the United States, Japan and Russia.
"The demand from developed markets began steadily increasing from the second half of last year. We are making efforts to developing high-quality moulds to satisfy the demand," said Su.
The Zhejiang-based company, which is mainly engaged in production and sale of moulds for industrial air conditioners, also develops garden pots which can automatically water flowers.

PARIS - Polling stations opened on France's European mainland on Sunday for a decisive round of the presidential election between centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-rightist Marine Le Pen.
More than 66,000 polling stations in the French European mainland opened at 08:00 local time (0600 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 20:00 (1800 GMT) in big cities, while the rest will close at 19:00 (1700 GMT).
Nearly 47 million voters are expected to cast their ballots.
French voters in overseas territories casted their votes on Saturday, but the results will be only known after all votes are casted on the mainland.
Official campaigning period ended Friday night, signalling the start of a blackout on any campaigning activities, according to French electoral law.
The law bans the publication of any early poll or counting results of the vote before all polling stations are closed.
Preliminary projections of the voting results are expected to be revealed by various sources after 20:00.
Macron and Le Pen topped the first round vote of the election on April 23, with 24.01 percent and 21.30 percent of votes, respectively.
Several major French opinion polls conducted after the first round have been consistent, which estimate that former economy minister Macron is likely to win the runoff after an intense campaign against Le Pen.

Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also known as the Forbidden City, will expand the sale of online tickets on a trial basis in July.
The trial run will last from July to October to test the feasibility of online sales of tickets for everyday, but tourists can still buy tickets at the entrances, according to the museum.
After the trial period, the Palace Museum will decide whether to phase out the sale of paper tickets and sell all tickets via the internet.
The all online sale may begin during the last 10 days of October.
By the May Day holiday in 2018, the museum may offer tickets for different periods throughout a day, in a bid to avoid too many tourists at a time.
Currently, tourists can only book tickets online in advance, but they have to buy paper tickets at the entrances if they want to visit immediately.
The Palace Museum began selling tickets online in September 2011. Currently about 50 percent of its tickets are sold online, with up to 70 percent booked online during holidays.
The Palace Museum started to set a daily visitor cap of 80,000 on June 13, 2015. The cap was triggered 32 times in 2015, 48 in 2016, and 10 in 2017.
Three steps to phase out sale of paper tickets
Phase 1: Preparation
Date: May - June
Starting from May, the museum will allow online selling of tickets for everyday, after an upgrade of its online ticket selling system.
Phase 2: Trial run
Date: July - October
The trial will test the feasibility of online sales of tickets, but tourists can also buy tickets at the entrances. Tourists can also buy tickets by scanning a QR code at the entrances.
Phase 3: Implementation
Date: From last 10 days of October
A full online sale will be carried out at a proper date, when no paper tickets will be offered at the entrances anymore.

C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily]
The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry.
With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft.
Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls.
Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft.
All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials.
These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919.
Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei."
Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane.
"The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said.
"Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said.
By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast.
Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035.
After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years.
So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates a point during her victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci at last week's WTA Stuttgart Grand Prix. Reuters
LONDON - Maria Sharapova might have to wait until June 20 to see if she will be welcomed back to Wimbledon this year.
Sharapova, the 2004 champion at the All England Club, returned to the WTA Tour last week after serving a 15-month ban for doping and reached the semifinals in Stuttgart, leaving her ranked No 262.
The Russian's return has sparked controversy on the tour, with some rivals saying she has been given preferential treatment.
The former world No 1 is set to play two more events, in Madrid and Rome, before the deadline for direct entry to Wimbledon qualifying.
Deep runs at those events could earn her enough points to make the main draw, while she will also find out on May 16 if she gets a wild card for the French Open.
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said on Wednesday there will be a meeting of the tournament's sub-committee on June 20, when it will be clear which players have been accepted into the main draw.
Wimbledon begins on July 3, its latest start since 1895.
Andy Murray, the world's No 1 men's player, said he expects Sharapova to be granted a wild card if she needs one.
"But I'm sure they are hoping they don't have to make the decision," Murray said at the launch of the Queen's Club tournament, a warm-up event for Wimbledon.
"There's a good chance that she can get in by right, which I'm sure is what she's hoping for and that's what Wimbledon would be hoping for."
Lewis said qualifying at nearby Roehampton would be a ticketed event for the first time, and that action on one of the courts will be broadcast live.
He said this was not linked to the possible appearance of Sharapova, but because of the upsurge in interest in qualifying matches.
Lewis also announced there will be a 12.5 percent increase in total Wimbledon prize money, to $40.8 million.
Winners of the singles titles will each pocket $2.85 million, a 10 percent increase from 2016.
First-round losers will receive $45,000, a 16.7 percent increase from 2016, as Wimbledon officials say they are placing more emphasis on helping lower-ranked players.
In another development, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said two-time Wimbledon finalist Ilie Nastase will not be invited to the Royal Box on Centre Court.
The 70-year-old Romanian has been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation following his comments about the skin color of the baby Serena Williams is expecting, and his foul-mouthed outbursts during a recent Fed Cup match between Romania and Britain.
"What he did, we have to say, his actions were not very good and we condemn them," Brook said.
Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Williams' unborn baby when he said: "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?"
The two-time Grand Slam winner also asked British captain Anne Keothavong for her hotel room number and verbally abused umpire Jaume Campistol and referee Andreas Egli before swearing at Keothavong and British player Johanna Konta as he was banished from the court.
Nastase was escorted out by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie.
A national icon in Romania, Nastase defied the ban by briefly returning the following day. He pointedly refused to apologize in the immediate aftermath of the controversy, saying he had no regrets.
Nastase, who twice finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in the 1970s, is awaiting sanction by the International Tennis Federation after being hit with a provisional suspension.

CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."

The lottery will guarantee "transparent and fair distribution" of units, and is part of the city's measures to curb speculation in the housing market.
Shanghai's housing regulator also said real estate developers, agents and sales companies are forbidden from getting involved in speculative home sales.
The authorities concerned will blacklist firms and individuals that violate the rules.
Property firms and agents need to carry out only genuine, verifiable deals and prevent transactions involving fictitious names aimed at circumventing purchase limits, said the circular, which was issued late on Thursday.
Analysts said the lottery system will benefit buyers of smaller, lower-priced properties that are in limited supply and hence in high demand.
The lottery system also requires that transactions be notarized to ensure fair and transparent distribution of market-oriented housing projects.
The lottery system has been widely applied already in the distribution of subsidized government housing for lower-income families and low-rent houses.
"When supply (of new homes) doesn't meet demand, a notarized lottery system will work better than any other system. Unnotarized lottery systems used to lead to underhand dealings in the past, and scalpers would enter the market to resell home purchase qualifications. Now, the new system will maximize protection for homebuyers," said Yan Yuejin, a senior researcher with the E-house China R&D Institute.
Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with Centaline Property, said the lottery system supplements existing home purchase restrictions in Shanghai. It is likely to be adopted by other cities facing similar demand-supply mismatches.
Shanghai's new homes inventory by April-end stood at 6.28 million square meters, which would be absorbed by the market in nine months, if there are no more supplies, E-house data showed.
In Shanghai, stricter limits have been imposed on homebuyers' qualifications and down payment requirements to stabilize prices.

PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Saturday that the latest US-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint military drills were "unprecedentedly hideous and most adventurous ones" in several decades.
In a military commentary, the official Korean Central News Agency said the US and ROK have made it public that all their joint military drills aimed to "remove the leadership" of the DPRK and "bring down its system."
These exercises had "thrown away their deceptive veils as annual drills and defensive ones," it said.
"The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills revealed that the new Trump administration, too, is resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK by use of force, tougher sanctions and pressure," it said.
The US and ROK have just concluded two-month-long joint military drills involving 300,000 troops.
The US has also sent its aircraft carrier task group USS Carl Vinson and a nuclear submarine to waters off the Korean peninsula, besides carrying out nuclear bomb dropping drills in ROK and test launching two intercontinental ballistic missile within one week from California to the Western Pacific over the past two weeks.

The 4th Xinghao Youth Script and Creative Designing Competition and Award Ceremony was held at the Beiguo Theater of Beijing Normal University on May 4 as a part of the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival.
"A successful film may involve many factors such as a good director, popular performers or brilliant visual effects, but a failed one must have a close relationship with the quality of a certain script," Wang Hailin, renowned Chinese playwright, said at the competition.
"College students represent the most vigorous and passionate group in the entire society. When you devote yourselves to writing scripts, you may be faced with many temptations like money, power, glory or status, but you should not forget your original will, and stick to your dream," he added.
Since its call for scripts one month ago, a total of 540 creative scripts from various fields were sent by students from many top universities, including Beijing Film Academy, The Central Academy of Drama, Shanghai Theatre Academy, Communication University of China, Peking University, Fudan University.
Eighteen candidates’ scripts were selected for the final competition. There were three second prize winners, five third prize winners and 10 consolation prizes awarded.

Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]
With the United States having withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, trade officials from the remaining members gathered in Canada on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking ways to keep it alive. But can they really make any breakthrough?
The US accounted for about 24 percent of the world's total GDP last year according to the World Bank. Thus, a TPP without the US is simply not feasible. With the US having a central role, the economies of the member countries were complementary to it. After the US' withdrawal from the deal, the total share of the remaining TPP members has decreased to 13 percent of the world's total GDP and the competition among them has increased while the complementary nature of their economies has decreased.
For instance, Japan and Australia both want to export their agriculture products. Australia and Canada both want to increase their exports of minerals. Thus, the real economic value of any TPP without the US is limited. Considering the business community is more sensitive to the economic benefits than its political purposes, the strategic advantages calculated by politicians may not be enough to win the support of the business communities in the various countries.
If a deal was ratified without the US, it would send a very strong signal that the US has lost direct control of it. Then US President Donald Trump's decision to quit would be harshly criticized as a policy mistake, the US' credibility would be doubted by its allies, and, should the US want to join someday, it would have lost the initial advantages it had.
For the Barack Obama administration, the TPP had dual values. One was its economic value, the other its strategic value.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated in January 2016 that the TPP would increase annual real incomes in the US by $131 billion, 0.5 percent of its GDP, by 2030, and its annual exports by $357 billion, 9.1 percent of its GDP, by the same year.
But on Jan 23, Trump, the newly installed US president, signed an executive order to quit the TPP.
He had a number of justifications for this.
First, although joining the TPP would have been lucrative for the US as a whole, many of his supporters, especially blue-collar workers disliked the TPP and claimed it would hurt them. Fulfilling his campaign promise to these voters was necessary to legitimize Trump's presidency.
Second, Trump's withdrawal from the TPP doesn't mean it has died. The agreement is still there and can be resurrected if desired.
Third, Trump was not satisfied with some of the clauses in the TPP. He wants to use withdrawal from the deal as a way to shift from the multilateral mechanism to bilateral mechanisms, and then use the efficiency of bilateral negotiations to "fix" the clauses in the TPP he is not happy with, and push the US' allies to take more responsibility.
Fourth, even though the TPP would still have a strategic function, without the US as a member its hedging function has been weakened dramatically, since most of the remaining members have strong economic and trade relations with China.
Trump has thus concluded that is it not a good deal for the US to sacrifice its market opportunities for such a limited strategic purpose. For Trump, an ungratified and stagnating TPP that can be resurrected when needed is in the best interests of the US.

Long seen as an anti-ageing treatment for women, more and more men are giving Botox – err, Brotox – a shot. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Enter Botox, a lethal neurotoxin (technically "botulinum toxin type A") that relaxes muscles via injection and was discovered to help reduce wrinkles by a California plastic surgeon in 1989. After a long period of formal trials, it was approved for use in the US in 2002 – and has since become a household name as the world's most common cosmetic procedure.
Long used by women, in the early Botox days, there were few male clients; most did it for occupational reasons, such as actors and anchormen. Through wider acceptance in society, it has become more common for men in recent years. Some clinics in Hong Kong even claim that male clients compose 50% of their business today. The rise in popularity explains how the humorous nickname "Brotox" has entered the vernacular.
Where do guys get their Brotox injected? They say the eyes are the key to the soul – and so the most popular areas address crow's feet and the vertical lines between the eyebrows. These lines can make a man look angry and unapproachable, which is why nine-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz, an open endorser of Botox, wanted to try it in the first place. In an interview with plastic surgery website Make Me Heal, Spitz explained, "I wasn't trying to look younger or different; I just wanted my face to portray how good I was feeling inside – instead of telling the world that I was perplexed or angry all the time."
Concerned about "surprise lines" on your forehead? Those annoying, intractable lines can also make you look older than you actually are, so a considerable amount of Botox treatments are focused on this area. However, it's hard to completely remove them because this is an easy-to-crease area.
Botox has been nicknamed the "lunchtime facelift" because it can be done in less than 15 minutes. Expect to see effects after two weeks of injection, with the best results after about a month. In Hong Kong, the standard practice is to have a consultation session with your doctor before deciding what areas to address and how many shots are needed. Fees are charged per area or per unit, depending on the clinic; locally, some start at HK$3,000 per treatment package of 10 units. You don't need to drastically change your routine or eating habits. Just avoid alcohol on the first day of injection and don't apply pressure to the area. So, what are your plans for lunch?

CAI MENG/CHINA DAILY
Launched by President Xi Jinping in September 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is designed to improve global connectivity and physical infrastructure to better link China with the rest of Asia, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The initiative envisages the creation of multiple economic corridors under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.




In the past four years, the Belt and Road Initiative has gradually gained traction with new projects and financing coming on stream, such as the flagship 418-kilometer rail link with Laos and the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. While it's hard to quantify the total number of projects and amount of financing, the China Development Bank said it alone had reserved $890 billion for more than 900 projects in 2015, highlighting the magnitude of the undertaking.
Indeed, while new multilateral institutions such as the AIIB have started to play an active role in project financing, most of the funding for the initiative's projects is actually bilateral. In addition to that from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, we estimate that the "big-four" State-owned banks extended $90 billion loans to the economies along the initiative's two routes in 2016. Thus, bilateral financing from China's commercial and policy banks dwarfs multilateral financing and we expect that to remain the case in the future.
Nevertheless, even the combined annual bilateral and multilateral financing flows, including those from international multilateral institutions (such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) are modest compared to infrastructure spending and needs in the vast region covered by the initiative (the Asian Development Bank estimates the annual infrastructure investment needs at $1.7 trillion until 2030).
That said, the initiative-generated infrastructure will benefit some of the least developed parts of the world, and improved infrastructure should facilitate trade and investment, create new market demand and contribute to global development. While we estimate the region covered by the initiative will contribute 80 percent of global GDP growth by 2050, up from 68 percent in 2016, our fairly constructive projection of growth in the region is subject to downside risks, including those from global trade protectionism and, domestically, from supply side constraints, which, however, can be reduced by infrastructure development, and regional trade and investment collaboration.
Of course, China needs to make sure its engagement with other countries does not become unbalanced. Especially, it needs to ensure its manufacturing exports to the economies along the two routes do not crowd out domestic production and result in trade deficits that could lead to economic and/or political tensions. In fact, while the share of China's exports to the region covered by the initiative has grown steadily, from 23 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2016, the share of China's imports from the economies along the two routes has fallen in recent years (measured in US dollars)－partly because of the drop in commodity prices, though.
We expect Chinese construction companies to largely benefit from the initiative through new sources of demand abroad, but we don't expect it to have a major impact on mopping up excess capacity in China's heavy industry, because the annual demand for heavy industrial products in the initiative-generated projects will be small compared to the scale of overcapacity in China's heavy industries.
In conclusion, China has devoted significant amounts of political capital, energy and financial resources to the initiative, and it has made some notable progress over the past four years. And although the initiative's short-term macro impact is likely to be modest, if well managed, we expect it to support long-term growth and development in the economies involved. The initiative can also increase China's international influence by providing a platform for it to enhance its role in global financial governance, and eventually help the internationalization of the yuan by encouraging its use in both trade and financial transactions, albeit under the condition that China liberalizes its capital account.

BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.

A potential homebuyer checks out a property project in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Dec 17, 2016. [Asianewsphoto by Long Wei]
BEIJING HAS INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES to cool its real estate market. At least eight banks have raised their mortgage interest rates, and five no longer accept personal applications for loans if their pledges are commercial real estate. The Mirror, a Beijing-based newspaper, comments:




These cooling measures come at the right time. As property prices in the capital have continuously risen, hot money rushed into the realty market. If that trend continues, the ever-growing bubble in the housing market would pose a challenge to the national economy.
The falling number of secondhand house deals best shows that the measures are quite effective. According to realty agencies, the number of secondhand house deals registered via online platforms in April was 16,902, 35 percent lower than the figure in March and 36 percent lower year-on-year.
But while applauding the firm actions taken by the authorities to curb speculation, we also hope they can take into consideration the needs of those who sell smaller apartments to buy a bigger one to meet their needs.
According to the current regulations, these people need to pay higher down payments as well as higher interest rates for their housing loans, even the tax and administrative fees for their deals are higher.
Some people want to buy a bigger apartment because they have growing families. Such buyers are not speculators. It is time to distinguish them from speculators and consider giving them tax incentives and other favorable policies.
On Wednesday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, announced its 2017 legislative work plan, according to which a property tax will be considered. By taxing those who own two or more houses, a property tax would be an effective way to curb speculation.
That move is also long-term because it will be part of the law. We look forward to the introduction of a property tax as it will help root out speculation from the realty market.

Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."

CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."

Two Chinese geological parks were approved on Friday to enter the Global Geoparks Network established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The two parks, Arxan National Geopark and Koktokay National Geopark, are located respectively in northwest China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Arxan National Geopark in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region is characterized by its landscape of volcanoes and hot springs and a large variety of lava formations, such as rocks and volcanic crater lakes.
Koktokay National Geopark is located in the Altay Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It has a large area of mining pits, with deposits of over 80 kinds of minerals. The park is also well-known for the granite landscapes and an earthquake fault zone.
A total of eight geoparks were approved to enter the network on Friday, with the others scattered in Spain, France, Iran, Mexico and South Korea. The new approval raises the total number in the list to 127.

LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers lays up a shot against the Toronto Raptors' Kyle Lowry in Game 2 of their NBA Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday in Cleveland. James scored 39 points to help the Cavs to a 125-103 victory and a 2-0 series lead. Tony Dejak / Ap
James passes Abdul-Jabbar mark as Cavs crush Raptors 
CLEVELAND - Unstoppable. Untouchable. Undefeated. 
Back on the playoff stage, where he's starred so many times before, LeBron James is making things look easy. 
James scored 39 points, passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time career playoff scoring list and pushed the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 125-103 blowout over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday night. 
Just like a year ago in the conference final, the Cavs are up 2-0 on the Raptors, who had better figure some things out or this series will be over quickly. 
Toronto was blown out for the fifth straight time in Cleveland in the playoffs, losing each by an average of 24.2 points. 
Game 3 is on Friday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre. 
James, who has won a road game in 27 consecutive series, appears determined to toss Toronto aside. He finished 10 of 14 from the field, dropped four 3-pointers and 15 free throws. 
"He did miss six free throws," cracked Toronto's Kyle Lowry. "He's playing unbelievable. He's playing like LeBron James." 
In Cleveland's past nine playoff wins, James is averaging 34.9 points, 10 rebounds and 8.1 assists. 
Kyrie Irving had 22 points and 11 assists and Channing Frye scored 18 points for the reigning champions, who are 6-0 so far defending their title. Cleveland is 9-0 since losing Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals. 
The Raptors didn't start Jonas Valanciunas, but he led them with 23 points. Toronto only got five points from All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who didn't make his first field goal until the first minute of the fourth quarter. 
Of bigger concern might be the status of Lowry, who sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. He scored 20 points but spent the fourth quarter in the locker room icing his ankle. 
"It's pretty sore," Lowry said after limping to the postgame podium. "I'm going to get treatment and get ready for Game 3." 
James came in needing 25 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, and he overtook the Hall of Fame center with a 3-pointer in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped the Cavs open a 26-point lead. 
James (5,777 points) now only trails Michael Jordan (5,987), the player to whom he has been compared since he was a teenager, for the most points in postseason history. 
James is also trying to match Jordan's six titles. He's halfway there, and the way the Cavs are playing, he could have No 4 before long. 
Raptors coach Dwane Casey promised the Raptors "would be a different team tonight coming out". 
He started a smaller lineup, benching the 7-foot Valanciunas and forward DeMarre Carroll in favor of guard Norman Powell and forward Patrick Patterson. 
Casey also moved Serge Ibaka from power forward to center. 
The moves were intended to give Toronto more ball handlers and open the floor on offense. 
They didn't work, simply because the Raptors couldn't contain James. 
Casey, though, is confident his team can go home and even the series. 
"I believe in our players," he said. "I believe in our guys. I know there is another level we can get to. I've seen it before." 
It won't matter if James raises his, too. 
Milestone 
James also became the fourth player with 300 career 3-pointers in the postseason, joining Ray Allen (385), Reg-gie Miller (320) and Manu Ginobili (312). 
On his 40th birthday, coach Tyronn Lue said the best gift would be a win. But the former NBA journeyman, who won two titles and played for seven teams, reflected on the milestone. 
"A little kid from Mexico (Missouri) with just dreams and hopes," he said. 
"You never thought it would come true, but I worked hard and I'm here and I'm just blessed."

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd said that the C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, is set to become the new star of its 600-plus aircraft fleet, stating that its "safety and state-of-the-art design will bring superb a flying experience to its passengers".
In a written reply to China Daily, the Shanghai-based airline, which is expected to be the first carrier to take delivery of the homegrown single-aisle passenger jet, said it was "extremely confident about the future of the C919".
China Eastern pre-ordered 20 C919s from the aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd in 2010, and according to the purchase agreement, negotiations for the ordering of the first five planes will be launched within a year of the C919's maiden flight.
China Eastern is one of the nation's top three airlines, serving more than 100 million passengers in flights to 177 nations and regions in 1,062 destinations every year.
ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, the subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, announced its intention to purchase 45 C919 aircraft in October 2011. ICBC Financial Leasing is looking to support COMAC with joint marketing, market surveys, signing more orders and all-around financial services in the future, said Xu Qing, deputy CEO of ICBC Leasing.
"C919 will serve the most attractive market. The aircraft will be used in the domestic market, the Asia-Pacific region and the African market in its early days. By continuously optimizing the aircraft's performance, the C919 will go global in the future," said Xu.
With regard to the two dominant commercial aircraft makers－Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE－she suggested the future C919 should pay more attention to service at the beginning to build up its brand first.
"It's important to pay attention to customer support and services, and enhance product quality and stability. Overseas marketing should be based on continuously optimized products and services, an efficient maintenance support, and efficiency of operations," said Xu.

BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia, on Wednesday.Alexander Zemlianichenko / Reuters
SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. 
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions." 
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back". 
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors. 
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being. 
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions. 
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership." 
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.

BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.

China's foreign trade is expected to sustain an upward trend in the near future, as more export-oriented companies focus on developing new levels of competitiveness, according to the spokesman of the nation's biggest trade event.
"Chinese exporters are no longer manufacturers focusing on intensive production and lower pricing to compete in the global market," said Xu Bing, spokesman of the Canton Fair.
The Canton Fair－held twice a year and known as the China Import and Export Fair－concluded on Friday in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou with reported total transactions at the spring fair increasing by 6.9 percent year-on-year to 206.357 billion yuan ($30 billion).
"Development of new competitiveness－including technology, brands, quality and services－is reasons behind the increased transactions for Chinese exporters," said Xu, also deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
There were 196,490 overseas buyers from 213 countries and regions visiting the fair, a rise of 5.87 percent year-on-year.
"We can see that more companies participating in the Canton Fair displayed products with higher quality and design, which offer high added values and are more competitive in the global market," Xu added.
The spokesman said more companies were attaching importance to innovation and building overseas branding and sales centers.
Transactions at the brand exhibition areas during the fair increased by 16.9 percent year-on-year to $10.9 billion, accounting for 36.3 percent of the total.
Su Cheng, general manager of Taizhou Chenghao Machine Mould Co Ltd, said Chinese homegrown moulds, which are of high quality with competitive prices, had also been sold to developed markets.
"The demand for Chinese moulds has been increasing recently in developed markets, which are traditionally powerhouses for high-quality industrial moulds," said Su.
According to Su, the company's moulds have been sold in major markets like the United States, Japan and Russia.
"The demand from developed markets began steadily increasing from the second half of last year. We are making efforts to developing high-quality moulds to satisfy the demand," said Su.
The Zhejiang-based company, which is mainly engaged in production and sale of moulds for industrial air conditioners, also develops garden pots which can automatically water flowers.

WITH THE PRICE OF GARLIC SPROUTS plummeting due to oversupply, some farmers in Henan province have reportedly discarded their harvest of garlic sprouts, a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Thursday:
The local governments in Henan have acted quickly to the overstock by pledging to set up a garlic association to nip oversupply in the bud. But what happened in Henan indicates once again how easy it is for farmers to fall prey to price fluctuations.
That some have urged the market to play its part at the cost of "non-market minded" farmers is hardly helpful. Farmers do not necessarily have to pay the price for being unaware of how the market works and when they should increase or reduce their production. Local agricultural officials are obliged to intervene if need be and guide farmers through these dark waters, rather than sit on the sidelines.
The roller coaster price alterations of Chinese agricultural products can be devastating to farmers, yet they are not uncontrollable.
Home to a relatively mature and stable agricultural market, the United States can offer a lesson or two on balancing supply and demand.
The food produced by one US farmer can feed about 155 people, and one-fifth of the country's food products are exported to the rest of the world. In recent decades, the US has rarely suffered from an excessive supply of soybeans, oranges, or milk thanks to its efficient supply chain, at the core of which is its agricultural cooperatives.
Cooperatives enable farmers to own and control, on a democratic basis, the procurement of supplies and services, and the selling of their products.
This should be heeded by many local governments in China, which either step back letting the market take over or improvise countermeasures such as initiating emergency buying in the face of an oversupply. Neither approach is a cure to the problems facing Chinese farmers.
The nationwide promotion of cooperatives seems to have yet to reach Henan's local governments, which only began discussing the possibility of establishing a garlic association after farmers threw their hard-earned harvest away.
Establishing online exchange platforms could also better prepare farmers for unexpected market changes.

Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]
With the United States having withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, trade officials from the remaining members gathered in Canada on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking ways to keep it alive. But can they really make any breakthrough?
The US accounted for about 24 percent of the world's total GDP last year according to the World Bank. Thus, a TPP without the US is simply not feasible. With the US having a central role, the economies of the member countries were complementary to it. After the US' withdrawal from the deal, the total share of the remaining TPP members has decreased to 13 percent of the world's total GDP and the competition among them has increased while the complementary nature of their economies has decreased.
For instance, Japan and Australia both want to export their agriculture products. Australia and Canada both want to increase their exports of minerals. Thus, the real economic value of any TPP without the US is limited. Considering the business community is more sensitive to the economic benefits than its political purposes, the strategic advantages calculated by politicians may not be enough to win the support of the business communities in the various countries.
If a deal was ratified without the US, it would send a very strong signal that the US has lost direct control of it. Then US President Donald Trump's decision to quit would be harshly criticized as a policy mistake, the US' credibility would be doubted by its allies, and, should the US want to join someday, it would have lost the initial advantages it had.
For the Barack Obama administration, the TPP had dual values. One was its economic value, the other its strategic value.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated in January 2016 that the TPP would increase annual real incomes in the US by $131 billion, 0.5 percent of its GDP, by 2030, and its annual exports by $357 billion, 9.1 percent of its GDP, by the same year.
But on Jan 23, Trump, the newly installed US president, signed an executive order to quit the TPP.
He had a number of justifications for this.
First, although joining the TPP would have been lucrative for the US as a whole, many of his supporters, especially blue-collar workers disliked the TPP and claimed it would hurt them. Fulfilling his campaign promise to these voters was necessary to legitimize Trump's presidency.
Second, Trump's withdrawal from the TPP doesn't mean it has died. The agreement is still there and can be resurrected if desired.
Third, Trump was not satisfied with some of the clauses in the TPP. He wants to use withdrawal from the deal as a way to shift from the multilateral mechanism to bilateral mechanisms, and then use the efficiency of bilateral negotiations to "fix" the clauses in the TPP he is not happy with, and push the US' allies to take more responsibility.
Fourth, even though the TPP would still have a strategic function, without the US as a member its hedging function has been weakened dramatically, since most of the remaining members have strong economic and trade relations with China.
Trump has thus concluded that is it not a good deal for the US to sacrifice its market opportunities for such a limited strategic purpose. For Trump, an ungratified and stagnating TPP that can be resurrected when needed is in the best interests of the US.

A total of up to 20 billion yuan could be paid at the provincial level as bonuses
Beijing will offer rewards to nine provinces that exceeded their capacity cut targets in 2016, financed by a portion of the 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) subsidy allotted to help address overcapacity, Xu Hongcai, assistant finance minister, said on Friday.
Rewards for good performance will facilitate overall progress in cutting overcapacity this year, but less-developed areas that face greater difficulties with economic restructuring also need more financial help, experts said.
Local governments and enterprises in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will receive money for going beyond capacity cut targets in the steel sector. Chongqing, and Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces will receive grants for cuts in the coal sector, Xu said.
"The final amount given to each province will be revealed after the central government verifies the performance of each province last year," Xu said. "We will make sure that the allocation of money is transparent."
The total amount of the rewards would amount to a maximum of 20 percent of 100 billion yuan in special funds established in 2016, Xu said. The remaining 80 percent would be allotted to all regions to help with capacity cuts, he said.
Xu did not provide details on when the amounts will be announced or how the money will be spent.
"The central government's financial support is vital in helping the province achieve the capacity cut target because relocating workers and business restructuring are very costly," said Ji Jinghang, curator of Hangzhou Low-Carbon Museum in Zhejiang province.
Zhejiang's developed and balanced economy allows its laid-off workers to find jobs more easily than those in less-developed places such as in the economically lagging northeastern region.
Zhejiang ranked 14th nationwide in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017, with an 8 percent year-on-year growth rate, while Jilin province, saddled with heavy capacity cut targets, registered 2.4 percent growth during the same quarter.
Zhejiang plans to cut 2 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2020, while the target set for the steel sector this year alone in Jilin is 800,000 tons, according to provincial government documents.
Cheng Gong, a senior China National Coal Association analyst, said economically lagging regions need more financial support from the central government than last year because local governments face higher pressure to achieve targets.

Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.

Swiss President Doris Leuthard speaks during an interview with Xinhua in Bern, Switzerland, on Jan 12, 2017. She is expected to attend the Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15. [Photo/Xinhua]
GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.

A visitor poses for a photo on the glass bridge, in August. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
Editor's note: During the just-concluded May Day holiday, "glass paths" became the new buzzword in the tourism sector. Two experts share their views with China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang on the mushrooming of glass-bottomed walkways over gorges in scenic spots across China.
Are the 'glass paths' worth the trouble?




Glass-bottomed bridges were first built between two cliffs so that people could enjoy the scenery around while being aware of the scary depth of the ravine below. For example, in Baishi Mountain Geological National Park in Baoding, North China's Hebei province, a 95-meter-long, 2-meter-wide glass-bottomed walkway was built at an average altitude of 1,900 meters to allow visitors to experience the beautiful but stomach-churning scenery below.
The problem is that glass-bottomed walkways have mushroomed across China. Search glass-bottomed walkways on domestic tourism website tuniu.com, and you will find that 24 cities have built such "glass paths" as their tourist sites. And since a majority of the "glass paths" have been built across valleys bereft of natural beauty, one cannot but question the wisdom to build them.
The rush to build "glass paths" shows the officials in the domestic tourist sites lack creativity. Instead of using the inherent advantages of the tourist sites, they are busy copying ideas and examples from others. Such homogenization fails to meet tourists' diversified demands.
More importantly, the glass needed for the glass-bottomed walkways is expensive and the total cost of such a bridge can run into several million yuan, and some tourist sites may fail to earn enough revenue to cover the expenses, let alone make profits, which would be a waste of tourism resources. And any compromise with the quality of the glass or the overall glass-bottomed bridge could spell trouble.
Liu Simin, vice-president of tourism at Beijing-based Chinese Society for Future Studies
Such bridges need total safety system
No major accidents have been reported from glass-bottomed walkways. And many tourism sites claim double-or multi-layered armored glass, which is three to four times stronger than ordinary glass, have been used to build such walkways.
But good safety records do not necessarily guarantee safety in the future. There is a national standard for the glass used in outer parts of structures (as a curtain wall for a building for example) but no special standard for the glass used in glass-bottomed walkways. I do not mean to raise unnecessary alarm, but without a national standard no one can ensure safety forever on the "glass paths".
Besides, people tend to equal the risk with glass-bottomed bridges to the cracking of glass and people falling into the ravines. But that is not the only risk.
On April 9, the overcrowding on a glass-bottomed bridge in Mulanshengtian tourism zone in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, amidst heavy rainfall caused an accident in which one person died and three were injured. The incident should be a lesson for us. Regular safety checks must be conducted to test the strength and durability of such walkways, while the maintenance and supervision staff should be fully trained to know under what conditions the walkways should be closed and how to deal with emergencies.
Besides, not everybody is fit to walk on such "glass paths", because looking down into a deep ravine might raise a person's blood pressure, increasing the risk of a heart attack. In fact, several reports have said tourists started crying out in fear on such walkways. The tourist sites with such walkways should therefore display clear safety instructions so that visitors know the risks and people with unfavorable health conditions stay away from them.
Only a comprehensive safety system can ensure tourists' safety on glass-bottomed bridges.
Gong Jian, an associate professor at Wuhan Branch of China Tourism Academy

The lottery will guarantee "transparent and fair distribution" of units, and is part of the city's measures to curb speculation in the housing market.
Shanghai's housing regulator also said real estate developers, agents and sales companies are forbidden from getting involved in speculative home sales.
The authorities concerned will blacklist firms and individuals that violate the rules.
Property firms and agents need to carry out only genuine, verifiable deals and prevent transactions involving fictitious names aimed at circumventing purchase limits, said the circular, which was issued late on Thursday.
Analysts said the lottery system will benefit buyers of smaller, lower-priced properties that are in limited supply and hence in high demand.
The lottery system also requires that transactions be notarized to ensure fair and transparent distribution of market-oriented housing projects.
The lottery system has been widely applied already in the distribution of subsidized government housing for lower-income families and low-rent houses.
"When supply (of new homes) doesn't meet demand, a notarized lottery system will work better than any other system. Unnotarized lottery systems used to lead to underhand dealings in the past, and scalpers would enter the market to resell home purchase qualifications. Now, the new system will maximize protection for homebuyers," said Yan Yuejin, a senior researcher with the E-house China R&D Institute.
Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with Centaline Property, said the lottery system supplements existing home purchase restrictions in Shanghai. It is likely to be adopted by other cities facing similar demand-supply mismatches.
Shanghai's new homes inventory by April-end stood at 6.28 million square meters, which would be absorbed by the market in nine months, if there are no more supplies, E-house data showed.
In Shanghai, stricter limits have been imposed on homebuyers' qualifications and down payment requirements to stabilize prices.

As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.

PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Saturday that the latest US-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint military drills were "unprecedentedly hideous and most adventurous ones" in several decades.
In a military commentary, the official Korean Central News Agency said the US and ROK have made it public that all their joint military drills aimed to "remove the leadership" of the DPRK and "bring down its system."
These exercises had "thrown away their deceptive veils as annual drills and defensive ones," it said.
"The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills revealed that the new Trump administration, too, is resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK by use of force, tougher sanctions and pressure," it said.
The US and ROK have just concluded two-month-long joint military drills involving 300,000 troops.
The US has also sent its aircraft carrier task group USS Carl Vinson and a nuclear submarine to waters off the Korean peninsula, besides carrying out nuclear bomb dropping drills in ROK and test launching two intercontinental ballistic missile within one week from California to the Western Pacific over the past two weeks.

Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates a point during her victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci at last week's WTA Stuttgart Grand Prix. Reuters
LONDON - Maria Sharapova might have to wait until June 20 to see if she will be welcomed back to Wimbledon this year. 
Sharapova, the 2004 champion at the All England Club, returned to the WTA Tour last week after serving a 15-month ban for doping and reached the semifinals in Stuttgart, leaving her ranked No 262. 
The Russian's return has sparked controversy on the tour, with some rivals saying she has been given preferential treatment. 
The former world No 1 is set to play two more events, in Madrid and Rome, before the deadline for direct entry to Wimbledon qualifying. 
Deep runs at those events could earn her enough points to make the main draw, while she will also find out on May 16 if she gets a wild card for the French Open. 
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said on Wednesday there will be a meeting of the tournament's sub-committee on June 20, when it will be clear which players have been accepted into the main draw. 
Wimbledon begins on July 3, its latest start since 1895. 
Andy Murray, the world's No 1 men's player, said he expects Sharapova to be granted a wild card if she needs one. 
"But I'm sure they are hoping they don't have to make the decision," Murray said at the launch of the Queen's Club tournament, a warm-up event for Wimbledon. 
"There's a good chance that she can get in by right, which I'm sure is what she's hoping for and that's what Wimbledon would be hoping for." 
Lewis said qualifying at nearby Roehampton would be a ticketed event for the first time, and that action on one of the courts will be broadcast live. 
He said this was not linked to the possible appearance of Sharapova, but because of the upsurge in interest in qualifying matches. 
Lewis also announced there will be a 12.5 percent increase in total Wimbledon prize money, to $40.8 million. 
Winners of the singles titles will each pocket $2.85 million, a 10 percent increase from 2016. 
First-round losers will receive $45,000, a 16.7 percent increase from 2016, as Wimbledon officials say they are placing more emphasis on helping lower-ranked players. 
In another development, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said two-time Wimbledon finalist Ilie Nastase will not be invited to the Royal Box on Centre Court. 
The 70-year-old Romanian has been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation following his comments about the skin color of the baby Serena Williams is expecting, and his foul-mouthed outbursts during a recent Fed Cup match between Romania and Britain. 
"What he did, we have to say, his actions were not very good and we condemn them," Brook said. 
Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Williams' unborn baby when he said: "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?" 
The two-time Grand Slam winner also asked British captain Anne Keothavong for her hotel room number and verbally abused umpire Jaume Campistol and referee Andreas Egli before swearing at Keothavong and British player Johanna Konta as he was banished from the court. 
Nastase was escorted out by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie. 
A national icon in Romania, Nastase defied the ban by briefly returning the following day. He pointedly refused to apologize in the immediate aftermath of the controversy, saying he had no regrets. 
Nastase, who twice finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in the 1970s, is awaiting sanction by the International Tennis Federation after being hit with a provisional suspension.

Students from Guangxi University of Science and Technology play with pupils in Tantou township, Liuzhou city, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in July. English, dancing, painting and calligraphy classes were held for the pupils during summer vacation. Tan Kaixing / for China Daily
The pupils are watched by tens of thousands of people nationwide. It reminds us of the movie The Truman Show, where the main character lives in an artificial mini-world where he is watched by a worldwide audience around the clock.
The difference is, at the end of the movie Truman escapes from the artificial world in which he has been living, but the pupils are still being watched by audiences nationwide even though the media has exposed the voyeurism.
Legally speaking, school authorities that install cameras in classrooms and dormitories and provide video to live broadcast websites violate pupils' rights, because they invade the children's privacy without their consent.
According to reports, some of the schools argued they obtained consent from the pupils' parents when installing the cameras. The problem is, even though the pupils are minors they have the right to their own privacy, and so the consent of their parents is not valid. More important, the schools did not tell the parents that videos would be provided to live broadcast websites to be streamed nationwide.
Some "experts" have even claimed the pupils are attending a class and classrooms are public areas, so such broadcasts are not infringing on their privacy. Such opinions are nonsense because they totally ignore the pupils' legal right to privacy and the fact that classrooms are not public spaces to which everyone has the right of access.
China has been constantly improving the rule of law and made many achievements in the past few years. But it seems, teachers and schools need reminding they must respect the legal rights of their pupils. If the pupils realize their privacy and legal rights are being violated in such a way, how can they trust the rule of law?

PARIS - Polling stations opened on France's European mainland on Sunday for a decisive round of the presidential election between centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-rightist Marine Le Pen.
More than 66,000 polling stations in the French European mainland opened at 08:00 local time (0600 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 20:00 (1800 GMT) in big cities, while the rest will close at 19:00 (1700 GMT).
Nearly 47 million voters are expected to cast their ballots.
French voters in overseas territories casted their votes on Saturday, but the results will be only known after all votes are casted on the mainland.
Official campaigning period ended Friday night, signalling the start of a blackout on any campaigning activities, according to French electoral law.
The law bans the publication of any early poll or counting results of the vote before all polling stations are closed.
Preliminary projections of the voting results are expected to be revealed by various sources after 20:00.
Macron and Le Pen topped the first round vote of the election on April 23, with 24.01 percent and 21.30 percent of votes, respectively.
Several major French opinion polls conducted after the first round have been consistent, which estimate that former economy minister Macron is likely to win the runoff after an intense campaign against Le Pen.

The 4th Xinghao Youth Script and Creative Designing Competition and Award Ceremony was held at the Beiguo Theater of Beijing Normal University on May 4 as a part of the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival.
"A successful film may involve many factors such as a good director, popular performers or brilliant visual effects, but a failed one must have a close relationship with the quality of a certain script," Wang Hailin, renowned Chinese playwright, said at the competition.
"College students represent the most vigorous and passionate group in the entire society. When you devote yourselves to writing scripts, you may be faced with many temptations like money, power, glory or status, but you should not forget your original will, and stick to your dream," he added.
Since its call for scripts one month ago, a total of 540 creative scripts from various fields were sent by students from many top universities, including Beijing Film Academy, The Central Academy of Drama, Shanghai Theatre Academy, Communication University of China, Peking University, Fudan University.
Eighteen candidates’ scripts were selected for the final competition. There were three second prize winners, five third prize winners and 10 consolation prizes awarded.

A potential homebuyer checks out a property project in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Dec 17, 2016. [Asianewsphoto by Long Wei]
BEIJING HAS INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES to cool its real estate market. At least eight banks have raised their mortgage interest rates, and five no longer accept personal applications for loans if their pledges are commercial real estate. The Mirror, a Beijing-based newspaper, comments:




These cooling measures come at the right time. As property prices in the capital have continuously risen, hot money rushed into the realty market. If that trend continues, the ever-growing bubble in the housing market would pose a challenge to the national economy.
The falling number of secondhand house deals best shows that the measures are quite effective. According to realty agencies, the number of secondhand house deals registered via online platforms in April was 16,902, 35 percent lower than the figure in March and 36 percent lower year-on-year.
But while applauding the firm actions taken by the authorities to curb speculation, we also hope they can take into consideration the needs of those who sell smaller apartments to buy a bigger one to meet their needs.
According to the current regulations, these people need to pay higher down payments as well as higher interest rates for their housing loans, even the tax and administrative fees for their deals are higher.
Some people want to buy a bigger apartment because they have growing families. Such buyers are not speculators. It is time to distinguish them from speculators and consider giving them tax incentives and other favorable policies.
On Wednesday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, announced its 2017 legislative work plan, according to which a property tax will be considered. By taxing those who own two or more houses, a property tax would be an effective way to curb speculation.
That move is also long-term because it will be part of the law. We look forward to the introduction of a property tax as it will help root out speculation from the realty market.

Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."

Long seen as an anti-ageing treatment for women, more and more men are giving Botox – err, Brotox – a shot. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Enter Botox, a lethal neurotoxin (technically "botulinum toxin type A") that relaxes muscles via injection and was discovered to help reduce wrinkles by a California plastic surgeon in 1989. After a long period of formal trials, it was approved for use in the US in 2002 – and has since become a household name as the world's most common cosmetic procedure. 
Long used by women, in the early Botox days, there were few male clients; most did it for occupational reasons, such as actors and anchormen. Through wider acceptance in society, it has become more common for men in recent years. Some clinics in Hong Kong even claim that male clients compose 50% of their business today. The rise in popularity explains how the humorous nickname "Brotox" has entered the vernacular. 
Where do guys get their Brotox injected? They say the eyes are the key to the soul – and so the most popular areas address crow's feet and the vertical lines between the eyebrows. These lines can make a man look angry and unapproachable, which is why nine-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz, an open endorser of Botox, wanted to try it in the first place. In an interview with plastic surgery website Make Me Heal, Spitz explained, "I wasn't trying to look younger or different; I just wanted my face to portray how good I was feeling inside – instead of telling the world that I was perplexed or angry all the time." 
Concerned about "surprise lines" on your forehead? Those annoying, intractable lines can also make you look older than you actually are, so a considerable amount of Botox treatments are focused on this area. However, it's hard to completely remove them because this is an easy-to-crease area. 
Botox has been nicknamed the "lunchtime facelift" because it can be done in less than 15 minutes. Expect to see effects after two weeks of injection, with the best results after about a month. In Hong Kong, the standard practice is to have a consultation session with your doctor before deciding what areas to address and how many shots are needed. Fees are charged per area or per unit, depending on the clinic; locally, some start at HK$3,000 per treatment package of 10 units. You don't need to drastically change your routine or eating habits. Just avoid alcohol on the first day of injection and don't apply pressure to the area. So, what are your plans for lunch?

Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also known as the Forbidden City, will expand the sale of online tickets on a trial basis in July. 
The trial run will last from July to October to test the feasibility of online sales of tickets for everyday, but tourists can still buy tickets at the entrances, according to the museum. 
After the trial period, the Palace Museum will decide whether to phase out the sale of paper tickets and sell all tickets via the internet. 
The all online sale may begin during the last 10 days of October. 
By the May Day holiday in 2018, the museum may offer tickets for different periods throughout a day, in a bid to avoid too many tourists at a time. 
Currently, tourists can only book tickets online in advance, but they have to buy paper tickets at the entrances if they want to visit immediately. 
The Palace Museum began selling tickets online in September 2011. Currently about 50 percent of its tickets are sold online, with up to 70 percent booked online during holidays. 
The Palace Museum started to set a daily visitor cap of 80,000 on June 13, 2015. The cap was triggered 32 times in 2015, 48 in 2016, and 10 in 2017. 
Three steps to phase out sale of paper tickets 
Phase 1: Preparation 
Date: May - June 
Starting from May, the museum will allow online selling of tickets for everyday, after an upgrade of its online ticket selling system. 
Phase 2: Trial run 
Date: July - October 
The trial will test the feasibility of online sales of tickets, but tourists can also buy tickets at the entrances. Tourists can also buy tickets by scanning a QR code at the entrances. 
Phase 3: Implementation 
Date: From last 10 days of October 
A full online sale will be carried out at a proper date, when no paper tickets will be offered at the entrances anymore.

PARIS - The French electoral commission, which supervises the country's presidential race, on Saturday warned local media not to republish data and information hacked from centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign staff.
In a statement, the commission asked media not to report the content of the leaked documents on their websites, stressing that publishing false information would be punished under criminal law.
Late on Friday, Macron's campaign team said it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
The leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, it added.
However, the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation," according to Macron's En Marche! (On the Move!) party.
The alleged hacking of the leading political party in the presidential race came on the eve of the election's run-off on Sunday.
Pollsters predict Macron to beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen with large margin.
In February, Macron's staff said their campaign had been the target of cyber attacks targeting databases and e-mail servers.

Launched by President Xi Jinping in September 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is designed to improve global connectivity and physical infrastructure to better link China with the rest of Asia, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The initiative envisages the creation of multiple economic corridors under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.




In the past four years, the Belt and Road Initiative has gradually gained traction with new projects and financing coming on stream, such as the flagship 418-kilometer rail link with Laos and the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. While it's hard to quantify the total number of projects and amount of financing, the China Development Bank said it alone had reserved $890 billion for more than 900 projects in 2015, highlighting the magnitude of the undertaking.
Indeed, while new multilateral institutions such as the AIIB have started to play an active role in project financing, most of the funding for the initiative's projects is actually bilateral. In addition to that from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, we estimate that the "big-four" State-owned banks extended $90 billion loans to the economies along the initiative's two routes in 2016. Thus, bilateral financing from China's commercial and policy banks dwarfs multilateral financing and we expect that to remain the case in the future.
Nevertheless, even the combined annual bilateral and multilateral financing flows, including those from international multilateral institutions (such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) are modest compared to infrastructure spending and needs in the vast region covered by the initiative (the Asian Development Bank estimates the annual infrastructure investment needs at $1.7 trillion until 2030).
That said, the initiative-generated infrastructure will benefit some of the least developed parts of the world, and improved infrastructure should facilitate trade and investment, create new market demand and contribute to global development. While we estimate the region covered by the initiative will contribute 80 percent of global GDP growth by 2050, up from 68 percent in 2016, our fairly constructive projection of growth in the region is subject to downside risks, including those from global trade protectionism and, domestically, from supply side constraints, which, however, can be reduced by infrastructure development, and regional trade and investment collaboration.
Of course, China needs to make sure its engagement with other countries does not become unbalanced. Especially, it needs to ensure its manufacturing exports to the economies along the two routes do not crowd out domestic production and result in trade deficits that could lead to economic and/or political tensions. In fact, while the share of China's exports to the region covered by the initiative has grown steadily, from 23 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2016, the share of China's imports from the economies along the two routes has fallen in recent years (measured in US dollars)－partly because of the drop in commodity prices, though.
We expect Chinese construction companies to largely benefit from the initiative through new sources of demand abroad, but we don't expect it to have a major impact on mopping up excess capacity in China's heavy industry, because the annual demand for heavy industrial products in the initiative-generated projects will be small compared to the scale of overcapacity in China's heavy industries.
In conclusion, China has devoted significant amounts of political capital, energy and financial resources to the initiative, and it has made some notable progress over the past four years. And although the initiative's short-term macro impact is likely to be modest, if well managed, we expect it to support long-term growth and development in the economies involved. The initiative can also increase China's international influence by providing a platform for it to enhance its role in global financial governance, and eventually help the internationalization of the yuan by encouraging its use in both trade and financial transactions, albeit under the condition that China liberalizes its capital account.

Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."

Juventus players celebrate blanking Monaco 2-0 in Wednesday's UEFA Champions League semifinal first-leg match at Stade Louis II in Monaco. Jean - Paul Pelissier / Reuters
Higuain brace has Italians eyeing Cardiff 
MONACO - Gonzalo Higuain urged his Juventus teammates to keep their feet on the ground after he scored both goals in a brilliant 2-0 win in Monaco on Wednesday that left the Italian squad on the brink of the Champions League final. 
Argentine striker Higuain was set up by Dani Alves to open the scoring in the 29th minute, then converted an Alves cross just before the hour as Juve claimed a crucial victory in the semifinal first leg at Stade Louis II. 
The Italian champion has the final in Cardiff on June 3 in its sights, with a showdown against holder Real Madrid, Higuain's former side, looking probable. 
"The dream we have been pursuing since August has been to get to Cardiff and we are just one step away," said Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season following his $98 million transfer from Napoli. 
"We have not won anything yet, so we mustn't get carried away," added Higuain, who ended a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages. 
"I stayed calm. I knew everyone had faith in me and that hard work is always rewarded in the end." 
Juventus shone in all areas against a Monaco side that has lit up Europe this season with a thrilling brand of attacking soccer. 
Buffon still strong 
But the host found Juve's defense rock solid, with Gianluigi Buffon majestic as ever in goal. 
The 39-year-old, making his 149th European appearance, denied Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao in the first half and produced a stunning fingertip stop on Valere Germain late in the second. 
Juventus, which welcomes Monaco to Turin for the second leg next Tuesday, has now gone over 10 hours without conceding in the Champions League and Buffon has blanked the opposition in five matches in the knockout rounds. 
"In every game I want to show that I deserve to play at this level despite my age," said Buffon, twice a losing finalist in the Champions League. 
"I work hard every day for this. The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it. 
"We had the right approach. They are a fearsome team and the only way to beat them was playing the way we did." 
Buffon also praised coach Massimiliano Allegri for his decision to bring Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defense, thwarting Monaco's attack and allowing Alves to wreak havoc down the right. 
"Gigi showed that he is still a great goalkeeper. He always does it in big games, and Higuain scored two lovely goals," said Allegri. 
"But to get results, everyone needs to work hard. You need to make sacrifices and track back and he did that too." 
'More clinical' 
Juventus could wrap up a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this weekend, when it faces city rival Torino, while Lazio awaits in the Italian Cup final. 
To put its performance in the principality into context, Monaco had won its previous 13 home games and scored in 41 consecutive matches at Stade Louis II since November 2015. 
"They were more clinical than us - with two or three chances they scored and we couldn't put any of ours away. Buffon made some incredible saves," said Monaco head coach Leonardo Jardim, who sorely missed injured marauding leftback Benjamin Mendy. 
Now Monaco must attempt to become just the third team ever to overturn a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League. 
"It is difficult, but we need to keep believing. The best thing is to believe it is possible, even if we only have a five percent chance," Jardim added. 
In the meantime, Monaco will switch its focus back to its attempt to win the French title. 
It plays Nancy on Saturday and needs two wins from its last four league games to become champion.

China National Chemical Corp, also known as ChemChina, said on Friday that shareholders of Syngenta AG, the Swiss agrochemical and seed producer, have accepted its $43 billion takeover bid, paving the way for completion of China's biggest international acquisition deal. 

Based on preliminary numbers, 80.7 percent of shares were tendered in favor of the acquisition, higher than the minimum acceptance rate of 67 percent needed for the deal to go through, ChemChina said in a statement 

The first payment settlement is scheduled for May 18. 

The Chinese company plans to delist Syngenta's shares in Switzerland and the United States at an appropriate time. 

"The completion of this deal will help ChemChina become one of the world's largest suppliers of pesticides and other crop-care chemicals," said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. 

However, Ding said Dow Chemical Co's merger with DuPont Co and Bayer AG's purchase of Monsanto Co, which occurred in the past two years, would continue to provide intense market competition with ChemChina, as the top six international suppliers including Syngenta and BASF SE, have all been vying for market share and financial resources to push research and development of new products. 

Zhang Xiaoping, director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said China could use Syngenta's deep experience and resources in intellectual property, risk control and environmental management to bring its products to global markets. 

"On the other hand, Syngenta will have better access than other global companies to sell its products in our domestic markets," said Xu Hongcai, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. 

"China's pesticide industry is riddled with low profitability and only global scale can improve that." 

The government pins high hopes on the reform to solve structural issues in the agricultural sector, where some agricultural products are oversupplied while others rely heavily on imports. 

China has been encouraging its companies to use both domestic and global resources to ensure the country's grain and food security in its agricultural policy. 

Niu Dun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said earlier this year that the deal would generate a positive outcome for China to upgrade its abilities in grain and food production, supply chain building and processing. 

Syngenta has 28,000 employees in more than 90 countries and regions. Its sales revenue dropped 1 percent year-on-year to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017. 

Beijing-headquartered ChemChina possesses production, research and development, and marketing systems in 150 countries and regions. Materials sciences, life sciences, high-end manufacturing and basic chemicals are its main businesses. 

It also acquired nine companies in France, the United Kingdom, Israel, Italy and Germany.

C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily]
The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry.
With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft.
Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls.
Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft.
All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials.
These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919.
Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei."
Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane.
"The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said.
"Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said.
By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast.
Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035.
After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years.
So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.
