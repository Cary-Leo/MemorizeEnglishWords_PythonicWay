After hearing the word "mother" in association to a U.S. military weapon, Pope Francis says he was "ashamed."
According to Reuters, the Pope spoke with a group of students, telling them, "A mother gives life and this one gives death..."
The Pope continued, "We call this device a mother. What is happening?"
The device he's referring to is the U.S. military's Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), also known as "the mother of all bombs."
The Hill reports the bomb killed at least 94 ISIS fighters last month when the U.S. targeted an ISIS complex in Afghanistan.
In spite of their differing stances on many issues, Pope Francis is expected to meet with President Trump on May 24.

Not only does it look great on our stovetop, but the simplicity of its design and use is pretty unbelievable. To create coffee-shop quality espresso drinks, all you have to do is unscrew the top from the bottom, fill the bottom with water, add in ground espresso beans to the funnel, screw it back up and heat it on the stove. It only takes around five minutes all in.
To clean the Bialetti, all you need to do is run some warm water through it. Best of all, the taste of the espresso actually gets better with use, so it'll last you!

Membership is most certainly priced for the rich and famous with a $7,500 annual membership fee. That doesn't even include the terminal fee, which you have to pay every time you fly: $2,700 for up to four people. (That's $3,000 for international flights.) At least that includes free pre-flight massages and manicures.
The Private Suite experience is different from any other airport experience from the get-go. Travelers are screened by the TSA in the private terminal and don't have to deal with their baggage. A team of eight people are at your disposal, including several drivers and an airport escort.
"It typically takes 2,200 footsteps from car seat to plane seat," the website reads. "For members of The Private Suite, it's 70 footsteps. And they are all peaceful footsteps."
Instead of searching for your gate and then scrambling to buy a bottle of water and magazines to read on the plane, members can hang out in their fully stocked private suites or a shared lounge when waiting for their flight. Then, instead of lining up to board, members are driven on the tarmac straight to their plane "head-of-state style."

Just checked into my own suite at the all new private celebrity terminal at LAX. Easily the most luxurious airport experience ever! 8 people taking care of each guest, suites right next to the runway, and private BMW chauffeur to the airplane stairs. Also, private TSA and Customs lounge just for you. This is bliss! #theprivatesuite #lax
If he was actually going to catch a flight, a silver BMW 7 Series would have taken him across the tarmac straight to his plane.
The major appeal of the private plane boarding and disembarking seems to be no paparazzi, which admittedly sounds great for stars hounded by cameras.
The only problem: Those suites are going to make it hard to want to get on the plane.

A white former South Carolina police officer pleaded guilty Tuesday to violating the civil rights of Walter Scott, the unarmed black motorist he shot dead in 2015.
"The defendant used deadly force even though it was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances," the plea agreement says.
Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Scott's brother, Anthony, thanked federal prosecutors and said his family was grateful to have "justice."
"For me and my family, the healing starts today," Anthony Scott said, adding that Slager's guilty plea was a "victory" for his city, state, country and the world.
Walter Scott's mother, Judy, fought back tears as she told reporters she forgives Slager.
"I forgive Michael Slager because the forgiver is in me. That he [Slager] admitted he did it was enough years for me," she said.
Slager, 35, pulled over Scott on April 4, 2015, due to a broken taillight. Scott, 50, then ran from the traffic stop. The incident escalated, Slager has claimed, when Scott wrestled away the officer's Taser. Slager then fired his weapon as Scott ran away. Scott was struck five times in the back.
See Gallery
Slager's federal trial was set to begin on May 15, and jury selection was slated to begin May 9.
The former officer pleaded guilty to violating Scott's civil rights by shooting him with no justification — formally known as deprivation of rights under color of law. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
"We hope that Michael's acceptance of responsibility will help the Scott family as they continue to grieve their loss," Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, said in a statement. Sentencing has not yet been scheduled, Savage said.
The shooting itself heightened tension nationwide over alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement and systemic racism in policing.

According to a complaint and affidavit, On April 13th, 2017, Chesney Anne Wheeler, 38, gave birth prematurely to her daughter at 29-weeks, at her home in Williamsport. After giving birth, she told police that she took the baby out of the toilet, and wrapped her in a blanket before she passed out. When she woke up, Wheeler drove to a local drug treatment center, then to a friends with the baby's body in a cardboard box in the backseat.
She sought treatment at Wilkes Barre Hospital later that evening. At the hospital, Wheeler lied to staff about the baby's whereabouts and where she had given birth. She told staff that she had miscarried in Benton, Pa and that she flushed the 29-week "fetus" down the toilet. The hospital staff grew suspicious of a 29-week old fetus fitting down a toilet and notified police. Police later found the body in her back seat.
Wheeler admitted to police that she had given birth in Williamsport and she was afraid to take the baby to a local hospital because she had smoked crack and used heroin the night before she gave birth and was "scared they would find drugs in her system" Wheeler stated when she woke up, that the baby was limp and knew she was dead.
I wasn't thrilled about being pregnant. That's the truth" she told police.
A friend, who went with Wheeler, admitted that the two cleaned the bathroom where the baby was born and washed the towels before leaving to go to Wilkes Barre Hospital.
Wheeler is charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, obstruction of justice, and flight to avoid apprehension.
She is currently at Lycoming County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail.

Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon may be trying to make their relationship work again.
The couple, who got divorced back in 2015 after six years of marriage, have always spent a lot of time together, especially when with their children. They share twins Moroccan and Monroe, 6, and frequently post photos on social media and attend events together as a foursome. A couple week after stepping out as a family to the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, Carey and Cannon brought their twins to Disneyland for their birthday.
See Gallery
Though another insider contends that they're merely "co-parenting," the other source's claims make sense given that Carey recently broke up with her background dancer boyfriend, who she was dating for about a year after ending her engagement to Canadian billionaire James Packer.
"We're together when it counts," Carey told ET at her Butterfly MC Records launch event on Tuesday when asked about their relationship. "We're together for the kids, and I think that's the most important thing."
Back in February, Cannon welcomed another child, two-month old son Golden, with former Miss Arizona, Brittany Bell.

Gas prices are as high as they've been in more than 19 months and projected to rise further due to the impending summer driving season, according to GasBuddy. But there is some good news.
Specifically, Monday offers the lowest average gas prices, while Thursday offers the highest, based on GasBuddy's analysis of three years of gas price data. As the company notes:
"To put the amount of savings into perspective: If every U.S. motorist bought gasoline on Thursday for an entire year, they'd collectively spend an extra $1.1 billion versus filling up on Monday ..."
The best day of the week for buying gas does vary from year to year and state to state. But the study concludes that buying gas earlier in the week — as well as shopping around for the lowest price — still will save money for "many motorists."

GasBuddy, the company behind the free app of the same name, estimates that drivers can save an average of $325 per year by shopping around and using the GasBuddy app.

The app for Android and Apple mobile devices boasts "the most accurate, real-time fuel prices at more than 140,000 unique stations in the U.S., Canada and Australia," among other crowd-sourced information about gas stations.
Perhaps the easiest way to save a big chunk of change on gas, though, is by simply not paying extra for premium-grade gasoline if your car was designed to run on regular-grade gas.

The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.5% as of March 2017, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in many states the jobs that are currently available and growing are not necessarily the ones that have traditionally been available. With the economy doing relatively well, SmartAsset took a look at the fastest-growing jobs in different parts of the country.
Study Specifics
SmartAsset used Bureau of Labor statistics to find the fastest-growing job in each state (plus Washington, D.C.). We defined fastest-growing job as the job which saw the most growth in terms of raw numbers of people employed from 2012 to 2016 in each state. For more on where we got our data and how we put it together, please read the data and methodology.
Key Findings
And the winner is... – The fastest-growing occupation in the country is solar photovoltaic installer. Never heard of it? These are the people who maintain, assemble and install solar panels on roofs. This occupation only requires a high school education, as much of the training occurs on the job. Nationwide solar photovoltaic installers make about $42,500, on average.

Income inequality – There is a stark pay difference among the fastest-growing jobs in different states. The number of recordkeepers in Nevada, for example, grew 176%, but only made an average income of $27,610 in 2016. Food and tobacco roasting, baking and drying machine operators in Georgia make an average of $27,000 per year. That job grew 340% from 2012 to 2016. On the flip side, general practitioners in Massachusetts and computer and information research scientists in Michigan earn more than six figures per year, and both jobs saw the number employed more than double.
Financial examiners – People who work as financial examiners ensure compliance with financial laws. This occupation was the single fastest-growing job in three different states: New Jersey, Florida and Ohio. In fact, the occupation of financial examiner grew in every single state except for two, Oklahoma and Georgia. Only one other occupation was the fastest-growing in three different states: occupational health and safety technicians.
Manufacturing Jobs
Food batch maker was the fastest-growing job in Tennessee and food and tobacco roasting, baking and drying machine operator was the fastest-growing job in Georgia. In Mississippi, chemical plant operator came out on top, as did engine and other machine assemblers in Kentucky.
No state had an occupation grow as fast as machine assemblers grew in Kentucky. Their numbers swelled over 800% from 2012 to 2016. In 2012 there were about 170 engine and other machine assemblers in Kentucky, while in 2016 there were 1,560. This is a fairly well-paying job. It does not require a college degree and, at least in Kentucky, brings in an income of almost $40,000 per year.
Other parts of the country also saw growth in certain manufacturing fields. For example, sawing machine operator was the fastest-growing job in Pennsylvania, while in Montana it was coating, painting and spraying machine setters, operators and tenders. The only two fastest growing production occupations and state pairings which did not involve work with heavy machinery were hand sewers in Minnesota and medical appliance technicians in Indiana.
STEM Jobs
STEM jobs tend to be some of the most desired as they frequently offer high pay and have good growth prospects. On the national level, mathematics- and computer-related occupations (which is how the BLS officially categorizes STEM jobs) was the second-fastest-growing field.
In other states, STEM jobs were the second- or third-fastest growing. For example, in Nebraska, surveying and mapping technician was the single fastest-growing job but the second-fastest was operational research analysts, a STEM job. Operational research analysts grew 250% from 2012 to 2016 in Nebraska.
Other fast-growing STEM occupations include statisticians in Nevada (150% growth), actuaries in Oklahoma (133% growth) and application software developers in Georgia (86% growth).
Teaching Jobs
Teaching is traditionally a dependable occupation. Teaching-related occupations were the fastest-growing jobs in seven states. Of those seven, four – Illinois, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. – saw postsecondary teachers receive the strongest growth. In each of these states, the fastest-growing postsecondary occupation makes at least $70,000 per year.
Teaching can be a mixed bag when it comes to compensation. Preschool special education teacher is a pretty well-paying occupation, but requires quite a lot of education. On average special education preschool teachers in Connecticut make just under $70,000 and requires a college degree. Substitute teachers and library technicians on the other hand tend to make around $30,000 and require less education.
Medical Jobs 
Like teachers, medical professionals will likely always be in demand. There are eight states where the fastest-growing job is related to health care. Two states, Colorado and Wisconsin, saw massive increases in their number of psychiatric aides. Wisconsin, in particular, saw an enormous increase. In that state, the number of psychiatric aides grew by over 500% from 2012 to 2016.
Perhaps the most interesting example of growth in the health care field is the 300% growth in family and general practitioners in Massachusetts. This is a well-paid job, paying over $200,000 per year on average. Massachusetts, and especially Boston, is world-renowned for having great hospitals and medical schools, but a 300% increase in the number of general practitioners is unusual.
Phlebotomist, another healthcare occupation, was the number one growing occupation in Delaware. What exactly is a phlebotomist? For the less medically aware, a phlebotomist is the person who draws your blood for tests. Say you have an allergic reaction and you need to get a blood test, a phlebotomist would be the person helping you. The number of phlebotomists in Delaware grew 168% from 2012 to 2016. On average they make about $36,000.
Other Notable Occupations
Texas is not unique in embracing creative jobs. Commercial and industrial designing occupations in Alabama are up 214% and multimedia artists and animators saw an increase of 260% in their numbers in South Carolina. In Massachusetts and Florida, fashion designing jobs increased by over 100%.
For any true crime fans who want a career solving crimes, Kansas may be a good state to check out. Forensic science technician was the fastest-growing job here, with an increase in number from around 60 in 2012 to 350 in 2016.
Finally, when you think of jobs in New York state, you may picture investment bankers or taxi drivers in New York City and perhaps farmers in upstate New York. Turns out the fastest-growing job in the state is actually sociologists. Overall the sociology profession in New York grew 450% from 2012 to 2016. Interestingly the average income for a sociologist dropped by $23,000 from $96,330 in 2012 to $73,030 in 2016.
Data & Methodology
In order to find the fastest-growing jobs in each state (plus Washington D.C.), we looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, we looked at the number of employed people in each occupation in 2012 and compared it to the number of employed people in that occupation in 2016. We filtered out any occupation where the relative standard error for the estimate of the number of people employed in the occupation was greater than 20. We also filtered out occupations that were classified as "other." We ranked each occupation in each state by the percent growth over that five-year period.
All average salary data is from the Bureau Labor Statistics and is for 2016.

If you live in New York City—or lurk on social media even a little bit—chances are you've come across the following strange and wondrous sight: A huge, colorful arrangement of fresh flowers placed at a seemingly random location. Perhaps a larger-than-life bouquet of forsythia and sunflowers bursting from an empty city trash can. Or a mammoth garland of roses draped around a statue in Central Park.
These installations are so striking, they've likely caused you to stop in your tracks. They've also likely caused you to ponder the identity of the genius bandit behind these glorious acts.
See Gallery
"My team and I work really fast and very early in the a.m. Our call time for these flashes is 5:45 a.m., and we try to finish them before sunrise. We always recycle flowers from events when possible."
"I don't see us stopping anytime soon. These flashes are so gratifying and rewarding on many levels. There is something sort of 'Banksy-esque' about what we do, which is fun and exciting!"
"We never broadcast where our next flash will be. They just pop up randomly. We do have a hashtag that we spray by each installation: LMD x NYC. It is chalk spray paint, so it washes away in the rain. It's our way of saying #LMDWasHere."
"I can't tell you what's next, but I can reveal that we are thinking bigger and planning for that! I would love to get some funding to do these flashes on a much larger scale and reach a lot more New Yorkers. I'd also like to Flower Flash other cities. Chicago, Mexico City, Miami, Los Angeles . . . they are all on my list."
"Who doesn't love to get flowers? They are such a luxury, and New York City is a very gritty, fast-paced town. If we can bring nature—something wild and sumptuous—to New Yorkers and make them smile, the way people smile when they witness a random act of kindness, then that is a great thing. That is my goal. It's a really simple vision but powerful, I think, to try to create an emotional response through flowers."

Celine Dion can finally relax.
The price for the lavish house stood at $38.5 million at the time of the sale, though the ultimate price has not been disclosed.
That price was arrived at after a series of price chops over the last four years. It originally asked $72.5 million in 2013.
See Gallery
The singer had previously lowered the price to $45.5 million after her husband, René Angélil, died last year. Dion and her late husband bought the lot the house sits on for $12.5 million in 2005, then the adjacent mansion for $7 million in 2008. They then razed the existing home to build the current spread.
Cristina Condon of Sotheby's International Realty had the listing.

Not sure what to wear to a job interview? You might want to play it safe — and classy — and simply don black.
The survey included 180 successful applicants and 1,800 rejected candidates.
"You have to match [your outfit to] the company culture. If you show up in jeans at Citibank, it may not be well-received."
Once you make it to the job interview, it's important to make a good impression — and quickly.
It's not the usual blah, blah, blah. Click here to sign up for our free newsletter.

But before you get the opportunity to "wow" a potential employer in an interview — wearing a mostly black outfit appropriate for the work environment — you need to first pique their interest with your resume.
Keep in mind: Most companies have software programs known as applicant tracking systems (ATS) that "read" resumes before they're potentially passed on to a hiring manager.
It's important to understand how the software works so you can tweak your resume to best match what an ATS is looking for. For example, keep your resume formatting simple. Bowsher writes:
Images, special characters, fancy formatting (like tables, shading, text boxes, borders and separators) — as well as typos — can also confuse an applicant tracking system.

Two coffee shop unicorns are sharpening their horns to wage a legal battle.
Needless to say, Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino contained none of those ingredients.
Looks like 🎂🍭🍬🍦💎🍰🍩 . Tastes like 🍋🍯🌴🙃🤷🏼‍♀️💥🌈 . Made with 🌊🌿🌺🍯🍋🍈💙 . Makes you feel like ⚡️🙌👁🦄😍🤸🏽‍♀️🚀 . 📸: @shilin_cchen
However, The End claims that the Unicorn Frappuccino was too similar in outward appearance to their unicorn latte. Both drinks prominently display bright colors, pink and blue in particular.
The End also felt that Starbucks' product launch was designed to overshadow their unicorn latte, with the lawsuit also noting that The End has had a trademark pending on the drink name since January.
Image: starbucks
Starbucks, of course, stated that the accusations have no grounds. And while part of us hates siding with corporate giants, we may have to agree with them here. It's very hard to imagine that Starbucks designed both their drink and their marketing campaign to purposefully overshadow a small cafe in Brooklyn.
The drinks are also fundamentally different to their very core. Starbucks' unicorn is all about sugary sweetness while The End's unicorn attempts to help people find energy through all-natural ingredients (algae!). Because of that, these two unicorn drinks automatically target two almost completely different audiences. You drink the latte when you want to keep your good vibes going after some restorative yoga, and you drink the frappuccino when you want to treat yo'self and feel really guilty about it later.
Maybe everyone should just move on and stop the unicorn trend altogether.

May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. bobsledder Steven Holcomb, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead at a training site on Saturday, the U.S. Olympic Committee said.
Holcomb, 37, was discovered in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York, the committee said in a statement. It gave no further details.
Holcomb, who underwent successful surgery in 2008 to overcome a degenerative eye disease, made history at the Vancouver Olympics when he piloted the U.S. four-man bobsled team, nicknamed "Night Train," to the gold medal.
It marked the first U.S. gold medal in the event since 1948 and the three-time Olympian's comeback from depression over increasing blindness, according to his biography on the Team USA website.
Holcomb took bronze medals in both two-man and four-man bobsled at the 2014 Sochi Games. He also won five world titles among his 10 world championship medals and was a six-time overall world cup champion, winning 60 world cup medals.
The New York State Police, which is handling the case, had no immediate comment on Holcomb's death.
"The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb," U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun said in a statement.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and the entire bobsledding community."
Holcomb's autobiography, "But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold," had outlined how people suffering from depression should seek treatment, the Team USA profile said.
"USA Bobsled & Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend," said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Chief Executive Darrin Steele. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, N.C. and Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

Today in daily airline outrage: A husband and wife with two small children onboard a recent overbooked Delta flight were threatened with jail time after being told they could not use a seat they'd purchased for their 18-year-old son, who had instead taken an earlier flight.
Brian and Brittany Schear were flying from Maui to Los Angeles with their three children, reportedly ages 18, 2 and 1. They bought three tickets, likely thinking the youngsters would sit on the laps of the other three during the flight. But the family changed plans ahead of time, buying a ticket for their older son on an earlier flight so, as the father said, their other son would actually be able to sleep.
This did not sit well with Delta.
Because the Schear's older son never checked in for the later flight on which he was booked, the airline likely viewed it as an open seat available to a passenger not yet onboard.
The Schears bought the seat, though, and figured it wouldn't be a problem to set up a safety seat for one of their infants.

Thus, the conflict.
The video starts with Brian Schear being told that he and his wife could wind up in jail with their children in "foster care" if they didn't give up their third seat.
The situation was already tense, but it's about to get confusing, so stay with me.
At this point, a woman introduces herself and begins to explain the situation, although she doesn't appear to have a good grip on what she's explaining. Presumably an airline employee, she informs the Schears that their younger son has to be held in their laps instead of a safety seat.
"With him being two, he cannot sit in the car seat," she says, and goes on to say that this is an FAA regulation.
In fact, the opposite is true. According to an emailed FAA statement, "children two [years] of age or older are required to be in their own seat."
We've asked Delta to get on the phone with us in hopes of clearing up which employees were responsible for providing incorrect information, and why that information was provided in the first place. They haven't taken us up on it yet.
Now, it seems logical to just transfer the older son's ticket to the younger son. With a new name attached to the seat, the flight manifest would accurately reflect the actual flight, and everyone onboard could go about their business. But Delta doesn't allow ticket transfers.
After it becomes plain that the Schears won't be able to use the three seats they purchased, Brian asks whether — for the sake of finally taking off — they can just hold their kids and get out of there.
Apparently not. He's told, "it's come too far," and their options are either to go or Delta will deplane everyone.
"What are we supposed to do?" Schear asks. "I've got two infants, and my wife, we have nowhere to stay, there's no more flights. What are we supposed to do, sleep in the airport?"
Schear presses for an answer, but the (presumable) Delta employee says it's not up to her or any of her colleagues.
"At this point, you guys are on your own," she says.
"Un-fucking-real," Schear says.
Hard to disagree.

Always Dreaming has won the 143rd running of the Kentucky Derby with jockey John Velazquez.
He was the late favorite going into the race with 4 to 1 odds. Lookin at Lee and Battle of Midway came in at second and third respectively. Classic Empire, who had been another favorite in the days leading up to the race, came in fourth. 
Rainy weather leading up to the race made for a muddy track. 
The Kentucky Derby is the first race in the Triple Crown, followed by the Preakness and the Belmont. The last horse to win all three was American Pharoah in 2015.

The runaway favorite of this taste test, Classico is slightly sweet, pleasantly herby and the perfect consistency to grab onto your pasta. Our editors described it as "lovely," saying it could pass for fresh sauce, with chunks of delicious tomato and basil throughout. When you're unable to make your own, Classico is surely the next best thing.
Getty
Though not as universally beloved by our team, Barilla's Traditional sauce is a solid option for a weeknight dinner. It has a much stronger, zestier garlic taste than many of the others, and that certainly isn't a bad thing. With a smoother texture than Classico, editors found themselves liking it the more they tasted, saying, "It has character."
Getty
This jarred option immediately evoked a familiarity and nostalgia for our taste testers. It's quite sweet, which some editors loved, and has a good amount of oregano flavor, as well as a meaty texture. This sauce takes third place, though, because it tastes more like pizza sauce than a good, fresh pasta sauce. 
Getty
Our taste testers were significantly divided on this sauce, with some calling it their favorite of the bunch and others claiming it had a strange, floral herbiness. It's the least sweet of all the jars, making it the perfect purchase for those who like a dryer tomato sauce. Like Newman's, it also has a familiar taste and reminded some editors of more traditional sauces. All in all, a riskier option but tasty nonetheless.

In his recipe for goat ragù, Di Meglio uses ground goat, preferably from the leg, for a Bolognese-style sauce. The result is a rich sauce with more flavor than you would ever get with pork and beef. If you're looking for an easy introduction to the protein, using ground goat is it.
Finishing up our pickled ramps! Until next year;) Goat loin and blackberry
While you can roast the leg low and slow, once you find a good purveyor of goat, you can play around with different cuts. Izard has run goat loin on her menu, serving it with pickled ramps and blackberries.

Retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Randolph "Tex" Alles, the current head of Customs and Border Protection, was named the director of the Secret Service on Tuesday.
Alles will take over for Secret Service Deputy Director William Callahan, who has been leading the agency in an acting capacity since March 4, when then-Director Joseph Clancy retired.
Alles' selection by President Donald Trump does not require Senate approval, and it marks a departure for the Secret Service, whose leaders have typically come from within its own ranks.

The announcement was made in a brief statement distributed by the White House.
The former major general will inherit an agency that's been mired in scandals, negative press attention and low morale.

One U.S. archdiocese is cutting ties with the Girl Scouts of the USA because it apparently promotes "programs and materials reflective of many of the troubling trends in our secular culture."
Archbishop Joseph Naumann of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas said the organization is "no longer a compatible partner." 
He cited its relationship with an international scouting association that he said advocates for "contraception and abortion as preventive health care for women." He also has concerns with the Girl Scouts featuring Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan as role models because they "stand in stark opposition to what we believe."

A Jerusalem-based Fox News employee is suing the network for discrimination and retaliation, following up on a statement made to European regulators that more litigation was coming by attorney who is representing more than a dozen clients against the network.
Jessica Golloher is a Fox News Radio correspondent in the Middle East and North Africa, and says she was notified within 24 hours of requesting via email an opportunity to speak with the network's independent investigator that her contract would not be renewed upon its August expiration.
"While Fox may claim that the decision to terminate Ms. Golloher was made before she sent the email on April 17, 2017, any such defense would be preposterous given that Ms. Golloher had previously complained about discriminatory treatment and she was provided no notice or warning whatsoever regarding any potential termination," writes attorney Douglas Wigdor.
Golloher claims she was marginalized because of her gender. She had been based in Moscow in 2013, working as the network's Russia correspondent, but when the Sochi Olympic Games approached they gave the lead reporting gig to a London-based male colleague instead of her. Golloher says she was told to act as Simon Owen's Russian translator and help in his reporting.

"Aware of Fox's blatant marginalization of her skills and its decision to promote a man as the voice of Fox during the Olympics, Ms. Golloher complained throughout the Sochi events about her discriminatory treatment and the fact that she was downgraded to 'secretarial' status for Mr. Owen's purposes," writes Wigdor in the complaint.
The correspondent also claims she was bumped to the late reporting shift and forced to cover "the ridiculous and frivolous 'panty protests'" following a ban on the import of lacy underwear, instead of covering "serious and relevant" news.
In another example, set two years later, Golloher says she complained to her superiors that an anchor-producer colleague was making "relentless edits" to her scripts and treating her like a "vapid, unintelligent female reporter."
Earlier this year, Golloher says she pitched a story that would require her to go to Afghanistan but was rejected because it was "exceedingly unsafe." She claims that shortly thereafter the network sent a male reporter to cover the exact story she had pitched.
See Gallery
She says she was informed she was being terminated because of "budgetary concerns."
"Since she has been informed of her termination, Ms. Golloher continues to be excluded from work assignments," writes Wigdor. "Moreover, freelance colleagues are being given assignments that are entirely within Ms. Golloher's area of expertise despite the fact that she is still on Fox's payroll."
Golloher is suing Fox News, its parent 21st Century Fox, VP of Fox News Radio Mitch Davis and Director of News Programming Hank Weinbloom for gender discrimination and retaliation.
"Mr. Wigdor's allegation regarding his client Jessica Golloher is without merit," a Fox representative said in a statement Wednesday. "Any suggestion of discrimination or retaliation is baseless. We will vigorously defend the matter." The company has not yet commented further on the matter now that the lawsuit has been filed.

Border Patrol in Arizona found a closed casket filled with 67 pounds of weed, worth over $33,000 over the weekend.
Border patrol agents stopped the hearse in the ironic town of Tombstone for an immigration stop. Manure was put over the marijuana to cover the smell.
After noticing inconsistencies with the driver's story, a canine unit was called to search the entire hearse and the man, who is a U.S. citizen, was arrested on suspicion of narcotics and contraband smuggling.
A press release stated that: "Transnational criminal organizations use a wide range of techniques to smuggle both humans and narcotics into the United States."

In SmartAsset's study on millennial retirement, we looked at median household income in the 15 biggest cities in America. We assumed that the average millennial would save 7.5% of their salary in a 401(k) with a 4% return starting at age 27. Using those numbers, we were able to estimate the age at which millennials living in those cities may be able to retire. We based the 7.5% savings rate on Fidelity Investments' Retirement Savings Assessment study which found that's the median saving rate (including employer match) for millennials. Read the full data and methodology below for a fuller picture on how we put this study together.
As you can see the state of retirement for millennials is not bad. This simulation assumes that millennials will start collecting Social Security benefits at age 67. If millennials can manage to save 7.5% of the median income per month (including any employer match) starting at age 27, it may be possible to retire relatively early. Even in expensive cities like New York or Los Angeles, the estimated retirement age based on the scenario we laid out is 65. In cities like San Jose or San Francisco, retiring requires more savings and so the estimated ages are 69 and 68, respectively.
To be on pace to retire at 65 in cities like New York and Los Angeles, millennials may only need to save around $300 per month, on average. In more affordable cities, like Philadelphia, that number drops as low as $240 per month. Even in San Jose, the city with the highest estimated retirement expenses, to retire at 69 with an annual income of $154,267 you will only need to squirrel away $529 per month, on average. Given that the median household income in San Jose is just under $85,000, that may be possible.

Let's take a look at what would happen if, instead of spending that money paying off student loan debt, millennials were able to invest it. A millennial who owes $14,425 on a 10-year student loan at 4.66% interest rate, can expect to pay about $151 a month. But if millennials invested $151 a month into an account earning 4% per year and reinvested the earnings into the same account, that $14,425 would turn into $26,617 after 20 years. After 35 years, about the time when millennials will be considering retirement, that $14,425 would have turned into $47,936. So, you can see how detrimental a late start on retirement savings can be.
In the first scenario we assumed millennials would receive Social Security payments starting at age 67. However, since 2010 the Social Security Administration has paid out more funds than it has taken in. At current rates the Social Security Administration has enough funds to last until 2037. After that time the Social Security Administration predicts it will have enough from tax payments to pay 76% of benefits. But without some changes in how it is funded the Social Security Administration will face a severe shortfall in the coming future.
With that in mind, we were curious to see what millennial retirement would look like if millennials were unable to receive any Social Security benefits.
The results are dire. If there's no Social Security benefits and millennials are only able to save 7.5% of today's household median income in each city, a normal retirement may not be possible.
In this scenario where millennials rely exclusively on savings in their 401(k), we estimate that the average millennial living the largest cities will not be able to retire until their 80s. Our calculator assumes an end point at age 95, so in most cities our calculator estimates that without Social Security, average millennials will have about 10 years' worth of income to retire on. That means working for almost 60 years for the chance to relax for only 10.
Take Columbus, Ohio, as an example. The average millennial who starts saving at 27 and receives Social Security payments at 67, may have enough income to retire at 64. In this scenario, Social Security payments would make up $53,000 of the $73,000 total annual retirement income. In the worst-case scenario, with no Social Security payments, the average Columbus millennial might not be able to retire until 85.
For this study on the state of millennial retirement, we looked at data on incomes and expenses in each city. We plugged those numbers into SmartAsset's retirement calculator. The calculator gave us the earliest age the average person would have enough money saved to retire in each city. We ran two different simulations, one in which we assumed millennials would have Social Security benefits and one in which they would not.
Data on median household income for all 15 cities comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 5-Year American Community Survey. We used that data to estimate monthly savings and retirement expenses.
We made several assumptions for both our simulations. To find monthly savings, we assumed that millennial households would save 7.5% of the median household income. We used 7.5% because that was the median savings rate for millennials (including employer match), according to Fidelity Investments' Retirement Savings Assessment study. To find the annual retirement expenses, we assumed that households would spend 25% less in retirement than they did in non-retirement. (We calculated non-retirement expenses to be all income not put toward savings i.e. 92.5% of income.)
We assumed that residents begin saving at the age of 27, are married, had no previous money saved, place all savings into a 401(k) and, for the first simulation, start take Social Security benefits at age 67. We also assumed a 4% return on savings and an annual inflation rate of 2%. Furthermore, we assumed that households had no additional savings or retirement accounts like an IRA.
The sole difference between the two simulation is that we removed Social Security payments as a factor for the second simulation.
Finally we plugged all this data into our retirement calculator to find the estimated age at which the average millennial would have enough money saved (combined with Social Security benefits and without Social Security benefits) to meet their expenses until the age of 95 in each of the 15 biggest cities.

Key Findings
1. California
California has the highest debt-to-income ratio in the country. Residents of the Golden State make about $28,000 annually on average, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The New York Federal Reserve Bank shows that Californians have a per resident debt balance of $65,740. This gives Californians a debt-to-income ratio of 2.34 on average. Like many other states, most of Californians’ debt is held up in their mortgages. Californians owe about $51,190 on their mortgages on a per capita basis.

2. Hawaii
Hawaii comes in second with a debt-to-income ratio of 2.1. On average Hawaiians make slightly more than Golden State residents. The median income in Hawaii is $31,905 as compared to $28,068 in California. Residents of Hawaii also have slightly more debt per capita than those in California: $67,010 to $65,740. Hawaiians have the second-highest proportion of debt tied up in mortgage. In total, $51,770 out of the total $67,010 in per capita debt that Hawaiians hold is owed on mortgages. That means 77% of per capita debt is mortgage debt.

3. Virginia
Virginia comes in third with a debt-to-income ratio just below 2. The average Virginian makes about $31,557 and has $62,520 in debt. One reason why lenders may feel safe lending to Virginians, allowing them to have a high debt-to-income ratio, is their low delinquency rates. Only 1.27% of mortgage debt in Virginia is delinquent by at least 90 days. That is the 13th-lowest rate in the country. Virginia also has a relatively high proportion of its debt in student loans (7.76%).

4. Colorado
Of Colorado’s total debt, 6.85% is tied up in automobile debt. That’s the second-highest rate in the top 10. However it is quite a bit lower than the national average of 9.57%. Overall there is not much separating Colorado from Virginia: Colorado has a debt-to-income ratio of 1.96. The median income in Colorado is $31,664 and the per capita debt is $62,200.

5. Utah

6. Washington, D.C.
Almost 15% of all debt held in the nation’s capital is owed on student loan debt. All that higher education may be paying off though. D.C. has the highest median income in the country and over half of the population over the age of 25 has at least a bachelor’s degree. In fact, there are more people over the age of 25 in D.C. with a graduate degree (32.3%) than there are with only a bachelor’s degree (23.8%). The capital also has the lowest percent of debt in the country tied up in auto loans (3.35%), probably due to the accessible public transportation available in the area.

7. Oregon

8. Washington
Washington, Oregon’s northwest neighbor, comes in eighth for highest debt-to-income ratio. The state has the third-lowest percent of debt tied up in student loans (6.29%) but the third-highest percent of debt tied up in mortgages (75.35%). Washingtonians also tend to be some of the most responsible holders of debt in the country. They rank above average in delinquency rates on all types of debt and rank in the top 10 for lowest rates of auto loan delinquency and credit card delinquency.

9. Massachusetts

10. Maryland
The Old Line State rounds out our top 10 states with the highest debt-to-income ratios. Maryland residents are some of the most well-off in the country, with an average individual income of $36,316. In terms of debt, Maryland residents have $67,020 in per capita debt, meaning their debt-to-income ratio is 1.84.

Data and Methodology 
In order to find the states with the most debt, SmartAsset gathered data on total debt per capita in every state (plus Washington, D.C.) and median individual incomes in every state (plus Washington, D.C.). To find the debt-to-income ratio in each state, we divided the 2015 total debt level per capita by the 2015 median individual incomes. We then ranked each state from highest debt-to-income ratio to lowest debt-to-income ratio.
Data for total debt per capita comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Data on median incomes comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 5-Year American Community Survey.

Drone footage captured a large shark lurking beneath the water, just feet away from two surfers who were none the wiser of the big fish.
Photographer David Finlay says he was operating his drone camera at a Kiami beach in the south-eastern region of Australia this week when he first spotted the dark figure moving in the water.

They can sense electromagnetic fields.
Some neuromasts are specialized to sense other changes in the environment. These are called ampullae of Lorenzini. Each ampullae works independently to distinguish the difference in electric potential in the environment versus in the shark's body.  Scientists think that this may allow sharks to detect prey, like muscle spasms originating from an injured fish, as well as predators, and mates. It is also thought that these ampullae may be responsible for detecting the Earth’s magnetic field, helping guide sharks during migration.
Researchers are also using what they know about this system to try and create new shark repellents.

Sharks can be hypnotized.
Technically, sharks can undergo what's called tonic immobility, or a natural state of paralysis. Researchers can induce this state in a shark by either flipping the animal onto its belly or rubbing its snout, depending on which species it is. Humans aren't the only ones who know how to use this trick. Scientists think large cetaceans, like whales, may use it as well to defend themselves or prey upon sharks (instead of grabbing hold of the dorsal fin, a larger marine animal would bite it). It may also be a tactic that sharks use on each other during mating to prevent injury to the female.

They're probably color-blind.
There are at least 440 known species of shark. Among such a diverse population, it’s impossible to say for sure that all of them are color-blind. But some research suggests that many are. All animal's eyes contain two different photo receptors, sensory cells that respond to light, known as rods and cones. Rods determine the light levels that can be recognized while cones control for color. A study of 17 different shark species found that although the animals can see at a huge range of light levels, they can only see at one color spectrum: Green. This is very rare in land animals, but common in other marine species such as whales, dolphins and seals.

But sharks have a crazy sense of smell.
Sharks are able to smell one drop of blood in 1,000,000 drops (26 gallons) of seawater.
Sharks' noses can detect tiny delays in how much time a smell reaches one nostril compared to the other. They use this as a directional cue and turn towards the side that received the smell first, allowing them to stay oriented.
(Photo by Philippe TURPIN via Getty Images)
There's HUGE variety amongst shark species.
Over 400 species of sharks have been discovered so far. The smallest of all sharks — the Pale Catshark — hardly looks like the monster you may have dreamt about. This little fellow scales in at a mere 8.3 inches!
On the other hand, the well-known Great White shark can reach up to 20 feet and weigh in at over 5,000 pounds.
But even the Great White pales in comparison to the Whale Shark, which reaches lengths of nearly 50 feet (about as long as a coach bus!) and weighs an astounding 47,000 pounds.
They have a weird way of sleeping.
Sharks are animals with gills, meaning that they must have constant water flow to take in oxygen and survive. This seems like a problem since they usually achieve this by constantly swimming. But all animals must rest.
Some sharks have special organs called spiracles behind the eye that pump water over the gills even while they're sitting still. Species that never evolved to have this helpful feature find solace in taking short breaks from swimming while sitting face-first in the current to allow continued oxygen uptake through the gills. 
(Photo via Getty Images)
The only bones sharks have are their teeth.
Like all vertebrates, sharks have a skeleton. The interesting thing about sharks is that theirs isn't made of bone. 
Unlike humans, sharks have a completely cartilagenous skeleton. This is the same stuff that makes up our ears and noses. This unique difference allows sharks to travel faster — important for hunting — since they can move their bodies without the rigidity of a bony vertebrate column. In the blink of a (human) eye, a shark can turn and bite a predator lurking at its tail. 
Cartilage is also a lot lighter than bone, aiding in buoyancy, or the shark's ability to stay afloat. Finally, it is much more durable to injury, which is a necessity in the predator-filled world that is the open ocean.

In the video, the shark is seen swimming harrowingly close to a surfer whose feet are dangling in the water.
The surfer was awaiting the next wave while the shark started to swim toward him and another surfer.
Finlay is heard asking his acquaintance for a phone, presumably to warn surfers of the shark, before the short clip ends.
"These surfers were completely unaware there was a shark swimming directly beneath their feet," Finlay said. "The surf lifesavers were notified there was a shark in the water."
Last year, 17 shark attacks were unprovoked.

Aside from traditional public high schools, parents may already be able to send their teens to charter schools – public schools run by independent organizations with more flexibility to experiment with how schools operate. There are also magnet schools, which are designed around a theme, like STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – and may attract more academically gifted students via an application.

U.S. News evaluated more than 28,000 public high schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Five hundred public high schools received gold medals, 2,109 took home silver and 3,432 received bronze in the national rankings.
First, U.S. News looked at student performance on state-required tests during the 2014-2015 school year. Schools had to perform better than statistically expected on these tests in their state, given their student poverty levels, to make it to the next step. Then, schools were evaluated on whether their least-advantaged students – those of black, Hispanic and low-income backgrounds – performed at or better than the state average.
The third step required schools that passed the first two steps to have a graduation rate of at least 75 percent. Those that did made it to the final phase – which determined if their national ranking was a gold, silver or bronze medal. In this fourth step, U.S. News looked at how well schools prepared students for college based on participation in and performance on Advanced Placement exams.
The top 25 nationally ranked high schools performed equally in this phase and a new tiebreaker process was used to determine their numerical ranks. The tiebreaker looked at the percentages of seniors who took and passed AP exams in at least four different subject areas – which showed how well students were prepared for college across a variety of disciplines.
The International Baccalaureate Organization was unable to provide U.S. News with IB data as it had in previous years for the final step, so schools only using IB exams weren't eligible to receive gold or silver medals. But like all high schools that pass the first three steps of the methodology, IB schools were eligible for bronze medals.
In a new feature to the rankings, some schools with bronze medals performed well enough on college readiness to be numerically ranked within their own state.

FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Leading French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign said on Friday it had been the target of a "massive" computer hack that dumped its campaign emails online 1-1/2 days before voters choose between the centrist and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen.
Macron, who is seen as the frontrunner in an election billed as the most important in France in decades, extended his lead over Le Pen in polls on Friday.
As much as 9 gigabytes of data were posted on a profile called EMLEAKS to Pastebin, a site that allows anonymous document sharing. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for posting the data or if any of it was genuine.
See Gallery
In a statement, Macron's political movement En Marche! (Onwards!) confirmed that it had been hacked.
"The En Marche! Movement has been the victim of a massive and co-ordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information," the statement said.
An interior ministry official declined to comment, citing French rules that forbid any commentary liable to influence an election, which took effect at midnight on Friday (2200 GMT).
The presidential election commission said in statement that it would hold a meeting later on Saturday after Macron's campaign informed it about the hack and publishing of the data.
It urged the media to be cautious about publishing details of the emails given that campaigning had ended, and publication could lead to criminal charges.
Comments about the email dump began to appear on Friday evening just hours before the official ban on campaigning began. The ban is due to stay in place until the last polling stations close Sunday at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
Opinion polls show independent centrist Macron is set to beat National Front candidate Le Pen in Sunday's second round of voting, in what is seen to be France's most important election in decades. The latest surveys show him winning with about 62 percent of the vote.
RUSSIAN HAND SEEN
Former economy minister Macron's campaign has previously complained about attempts to hack its emails, blaming Russian interests in part for the cyber attacks.
On April 26, the team said it had been the target of a attempts to steal email credentials dating back to January, but that the perpetrators had failed to compromise any campaign data.
The Kremlin has denied it was behind any such attacks, even though Macron's camp renewed complaints against Russian media and a hackers' group operating in Ukraine.
Vitali Kremez, director of research with New York-based cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, told Reuters his review indicates that APT 28, a group tied to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, was behind the leak. He cited similarities with U.S. election hacks that have been previously attributed to that group.
APT28 last month registered decoy internet addresses to mimic the name of En Marche, which it likely used send tainted emails to hack into the campaign's computers, Kremez said. Those domains include onedrive-en-marche.fr and mail-en-marche.fr.
"If indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome," Kremez said.
France is the latest nation to see a major election overshadowed by accusations of manipulation through cyber hacking.
U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of parties tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to influence the election on behalf of Republican rival Donald Trump.
On Friday night as the #Macronleaks hashtag buzzed around social media, Florian Philippot, deputy leader of the National Front, tweeted "Will Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?"
Macron spokesman Sylvain Fort, in a response on Twitter, called Philippot's tweet "vile".
En Marche! said the documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but that authentic documents had been mixed on social media with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation".
Ben Nimmo, a UK-based security researcher with the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank, said initial analysis indicated that a group of U.S. far-right online activists were behind early efforts to spread the documents via social media. They were later picked up and promoted by core social media supporters of Le Pen in France, Nimmo said.
The leaks emerged on 4chan, a discussion forum popular with far right activists in the United States. An anonymous poster provided links to the documents on Pastebin, saying, "This was passed on to me today so now I am giving it to you, the people."
The hashtag #MacronLeaks was then spread by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist whose Twitter profile identifies him as Washington D.C. bureau chief of the far-right activist site Rebel TV, according to Nimmo and other analysts tracking the election. Contacted by Reuters, Posobiec said he had simply reposted what he saw on 4chan.
"You have a hashtag drive that started with the alt-right in the United States that has been picked up by some of Le Pen's most dedicated and aggressive followers online," Nimmo told Reuters.
Alt-right refers to a loose-knit group of far-right activists known for their advocacy of extremist ideas, rejection of mainstream conservatism and disruptive social media tactics.

Sarah had been sent out to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles wearing an 'Anna' costume, tasked with finding a masked 'Kristoff' on the street.
"Now to make things more dramatic, Sarah and Michael have never been on a date before," Bell said while Sarah was out searching. "Sarah has no idea Michael is asking her to prom. This could go terribly wrong, but you've got to admit it would make great TV, right?"

The teen found the character and when she brought him back to the studio, she was surprised to find her classmate Michael in the suit.
"Sarah, there's something I wanted to ask you, but I didn't know the words, so Kristen Bell is going to help me," Michael said.

Sarah interrupted at that point, giggling as she grabbed the mic and said, "Yes!"
Bell set the pair up with a limousine on the big day, as weel as a glam session to help Sarah get ready and a tuxedo fitting for Michael.
"And a case of beer! I'm just kidding about the beer," Bell quipped. "Congratulations!"

"It's a joke in the neighborhood because every year [Nolan's friend] dresses up as a Klansman and he has two black grandchildren that he loves to death," Christian Dennery, a lawyer representing Nolan, said.
The lawsuit said the Trump campaign did not dismiss Nolan because he assured them he was not racist.

Cameras captured Culkin helping the 19-year-old light a cigarette before heading to Paris Blues, a jazz club in Harlem.
The duo are said to have left the spot at about 4 a.m.
Culkin, 36, and his goddaughter have a very close bond. The actor and her father were seemingly inseparable in the early 1990s.
After the "Billie Jean" singer's sudden death in 2009, the actor was there to show support for his grieving children.
Now, with her star on the rise — she reportedly just signed a multi-million dollar deal with Calvin Klein — she'll have her godfather by her side as she handles life in the spotlight.

A 25-year-old federal program that helps finance construction projects for historically black colleges and universities could be at risk under the Trump administration.
On Friday, President Trump signed a $1 trillion spending bill. In his statement, Trump referred to the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program Account as one example of programs that "allocate benefits on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender.
He goes on to say his administration will deal with such programs "in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment."
With those words, Trump seems to be calling the constitutionality of funding such programs into question, with the United Negro College Fund issuing a statement, saying it's "puzzled" by the provision.
Cheryl Smith, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the UNCF, told Politico the program Trump used as an example isn't based on race but on "mission, accreditation status and the year the institution was established."
University of South Carolina law professor Derek W. Black cautions that Trump's statement seemingly hinting at potentially defunding programs doesn't cite any legal proof that they are discriminatory.
Black also pointed out to Politico that religion or disability weren't included on the list, wondering why only "race, ethnicity and gender" were listed in the statement.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is embarking on an ambitious early childhood education plan to make full-day preschool free for all 3-year-olds regardless of family income by 2021.
"This is going to be a game-changer," the Democratic mayor said while announcing the plan Monday at a school in the Bronx.
The plan, dubbed 3-K for All, is intended to build on the city's ongoing efforts to provide prekindergarten education to all 4-year-olds through an initiative known as Pre-K for All, which the city says has more than tripled the number of 4-year-olds enrolled in pre-K education since it launched in 2014.
"This extra year of education will provide our children with a level of academic and social development that they cannot get later on, while at the same time, alleviating some of the strain New York City's working families face today," de Blasio said.
​​​​​​"Research shows children benefit more from two years of high quality pre-K than one year," says Abbie Lieberman, an early education policy analyst for Washington think tank New America. "There's been so much attention to pre-K for 4-year-olds, but very few have expanded access to 3-year-olds."
By the fall of 2018, officials hope to have a seat readily available for every 3-year-old living in those two districts, projecting an enrollment of about 1,800 children there – triple the number enrolled today, according to the mayor's office.
Providing free, full-day early education to every 3-year-old child in the city will save families approximately $10,000 in child care, according to the mayor's office and the New York City Center for Economic Opportunity, which also reportedly estimates that 1 in 4 families who take advantage of the benefit are likely to work an average of four more hours per week, resulting in an estimated $2,400 in additional income per family.
"The benefits of early care and education programs have a clear and measurable impact on the health and wellness of children and communities as a whole," Herminia Palacio, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services, said in a statement. "By introducing 3K for All and strengthening programs in the birth-to-5 continuum, New York City is ensuring that all children, including those who are most vulnerable, get a critical boost that will positively impact their lives for years to come."
"I'm happy to see they are implementing it a little more slowly than Pre-K for All," she says. "This would allow for more thoughtful implementation. Scaling up too quickly can jeopardize quality, and that was a big concern for Pre-K for All."

Mark Green, President Donald Trump's pick for Army secretary, withdrew his nomination Friday amidst criticism over his controversial statements about Islam, transgender rights and gay marriage.
Opposition to Green's nomination mounted over the last week, with multiple groups criticizing his controversial remarks and record.

"If you poll the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease," Green also allegedly said in September.
Green, a Republican state senator in Tennessee and former Army medic who did three tours in Iraq, rejected the criticism, saying that the "liberal left has cut and spliced my words about terrorism and ISIS, blatantly falsifying what I've said," CNN reported.
A number of US senators also called on President Trump to choose someone else. Most were opposed due to some of Green's controversial past comments.
Green said in a statement that those who opposed him were using "false and misleading attacks."
Trump's first pick for Army secretary was business executive Vincent Viola. He withdrew his consideration in February because of his financial holdings.

The federal budget in 2016 was $4 trillion, so $54 billion would be just about 1.35 percent of the budget that year.
Nonetheless, the number is really too big to fully comprehend, so to make it more manageable, here's what "We, the People," might get for $54 billion in defense spending. For the sake of comparison, we're going to throw in what we could do with that amount of money in non-defense spending, as well.
The U.S. plans to buy 2,457 of the planes.

Alternatively, the $54 billion could be applied to purchasing ammunition for one of the Zumwalt’s super high-tech guns. At a cost of $800,000 per shell, we could buy 67,500 of those.
The 5.56 mm round is most commonly used in the M-16 rifles, M-4 carbines and M-249 machine guns. According to U.S. Army budget documents, they cost $34.9 million in 2015, a figure that includes the standard ammunition used in training and combat, along with tracer rounds, test rounds and other types. The purchase is meant to procure ammunition to be used that year, along with some extra to maintain a war stockpile. At that rate of purchase, $54 billion worth would last 1,547 years. (Of course, that doesn’t account for the bullets used by other branches of the military.)

Kids go through all kinds of interesting stages in life. I find it interesting, and a bit entertaining, that my 7-year-old is now in that state where he's having conversations with his friends about more than just toys.
I can understand many of the reasons why parents start paying their child an allowance. It can help:
However, something inside me just wasn't buying it. I decided not to give my child an allowance for now. Here are 3 reasons why along with what I opted to do instead.
Right now, there's not a ton that my 7-year-old can do around the house. My husband and I do the cooking and cleaning. All my son needs to do is pick up his toys after himself, and make up his bed each day.
I've tried teaching him how to hang up his clothes and vacuum a bit, but he's not doing these things on a regular basis. Regardless, all of these chores listed are things he can do to help out and contribute to the family.
I don't think he should get paid for normal things he does around the house since because that could set him up for unrealistic expectations later on in life. My husband and I don't get paid to cook dinner and clean up the house.
My child is in a stage right now where he's interested in having money – to buy toys I'm guessing. He's not necessarily interested in doing his chores and helping out around the house. He's just looking forward to what's in it for him.
I actually see that as a bad sign. I don't want my son to be motivated to do things just for money.
There are many other benefits that come from doing chores and cleaning up, like having a neat home or room to enjoy, and avoiding clutter and pests that may show up when there are a ton of crumbs around.
I fear that if I start paying my child an allowance this early, he may not be motivated to help out and clean in general in the future if money isn't involved. It's important to teach my son that cleaning up is a natural habit that everyone should be happy to do regardless of if they're getting paid or not.
Some parents may argue that paying your child an allowance can help them learn about money. Without having money of their own how can they learn how to manage money properly? I don't entirely agree with this mindset.
Right now, I know that my son wants money so he can buy extra toys (that he doesn't really need). My husband and I get him plenty for Christmas and his birthday, and my mom gets him things occasionally.
Sure, I could probably give him a small allowance. Then I could teach him how to save a portion of the money instead of spending it. But, I can also teach him how to budget for real life expenses too.
I'm planning on giving him a budget for his birthday party next year. I'll let him pick everything out so I can actively show him how much things cost. I can also teach him about budgeting while we shop for food in the grocery store instead of just doing everything myself.
We can also discuss saving up for college. Plus, I really want to get him a stock gift card for Christmas so I can introduce investing.
Instead, I'm willing to give him money for going above and beyond my expectations. For example, if he were to get straight As in school in future years. I'm also okay with helping him collect spare change that's found around the house as an attempt to 'grow his savings'.
My husband and I are really bad about leaving spare change around and doing absolutely nothing with this. A few weeks ago, we decided to allow our son to put some of the spare change from around the house into his bank.
Quarters are off limits because we tend to use those for washing our clothes. But, as long as I approve it, anything else is fair game for his piggy bank. My hope is that collecting spare change will teach my son how to be resourceful in future years. He'll understand that all money is valuable and can add up.
Right now since my child has very few needs and plenty of time to learn more about money. I feel like this is the best solution for us.

A single conversation could be all you need to spot a psychopath.
1. They speak in the past tense. 
(PhotoAlto/Eric Audras via Getty Images)
(Bloom Productions via Getty Images)
3. Their language lacks emotional dimension.
For psychopaths, saying, "I love you," doesn't stir up any more emotion than saying, "Please pass the milk." They can parrot back what they've heard other people say but their facial expressions don't match their words. Their ability to verbalize feelings is most likely a learned behavior, as opposed to a genuine emotional experience.
(Fabrice LEROUGE via Getty Images)
Researchers have found that psychopaths talk more and use more emotional words in an attempt to gain attention and admiration. Psychopaths are really good at saying just the right thing at the right time. They know how to play on other people's emotions and they're master manipulators.
(Tom Merton via Getty Images)
5. They speak slowly and quietly.
Studies show psychopaths usually speak in a controlled manner. They don't emphasize emotional words like other people do. Their tone remains fairly neutral throughout the conversation. Researchers suspect they craft a calm demeanor intentionally because it helps them gain more control in their personal interactions.
(Ridofranz via Getty Images)
6. They talk about life in terms of cause and effect.
7. They focus their attention on their basic needs.
Rather than talk about spiritual or emotional needs or the needs of others, psychopaths are more likely to talk about their own basic needs, like food and shelter. A psychopath who confesses to a murder, for example, is more likely to spend the bulk of his time talking about what he ate for lunch and what he hoped to gain financially, rather than how his behavior affected other people.
8. They say, "um" more often.
9. They're great storytellers.
Whether a psychopath claims she rescued kittens from a burning building or says she was the only one at her last job who was willing to stand up to management, psychopaths tell rich stories about themselves. While some stories are likely to paint them as victims, the bulk of their stories are likely to portray them as heroes. All of their stories stem from their desire to gain trust and manipulate their listeners.

How Likely Are You to Talk to a Psychopath?
Before you start declaring everyone around is a psychopath, know that only about one in 100 people is likely to be one--unless you're talking to people in prison. Some experts estimate up to 25 percent of prison inmates may be psychopaths.
If you encounter a psychopath, don't panic. Most of them aren't serial killers. In fact, some of them are successful CEOs and business leaders. But knowing whom you are dealing with can prevent you from being manipulated.

Are you considering putting your home on the market? 2017 is turning out to be a great year for home sellers.

But remember to be realistic and respectful when asking an agent to drop their fee. Lewis explains:
It's not reasonable to ask a full-service agent to drop her fee to the level of, say, a discount brokerage like Redfin. If you can negotiate a discount of one entire percentage point, you've done great.

For the purposes of our study younger millennials are adults between the ages of 16 and 24 and older millennials are adults between the ages of 25 and 44.
The median household income for young millennials in San Francisco is $49,078. The marginal tax rate for single tax filers in California who earn between $40,773 and $51,530 is 8%. Combined with federal taxes, this results in a total estimated tax bill of $10,737.

9. San Jose, California
On average, a young millennial in San Jose pays more income taxes than his or her peers in San Francisco and Los Angeles. That’s because the median household income in San Jose for young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 ($49,595) is higher than it is in other major cities across the state of California. A typical young adult in San Jose who earns the median income pays $1,707 in state and local taxes and $9,240 in federal taxes.
8. Baltimore, Maryland

7. Aurora, Colorado
Aurora ranks seventh on our list of the places where younger millennials pay the highest taxes. Five-year estimates from the Census Bureau’s 2015 American Community Survey report that the median household income for 16- to 24-year old residents in the city is around $41,826. This means that a single filer earning median income can expect to pay about $7,417 in federal taxes and $1,937 in state and local taxes.

5. Virginia Beach, Virginia
Virginia Beach could be the perfect place to live if you like being in close proximity to the ocean. But if your income falls on the higher end of the spectrum, prepare to end up with a hefty tax bill. The federal effective tax rate for young millennials who earn the median income in Virginia Beach is 10.41%. Combined with state and local tax rates, that rate climbs to 22.7%, resulting in an estimated tax bill of $10,173 overall.
(SherryVSmith_Images via Getty Images)
4. Portland, Oregon
The median household income for a millennial between the ages of 16 and 24 is about $34,002, according to the Census Bureau. And while Oregon residents don’t have to worry about paying sales tax, many single filers face a steep marginal income tax rate of 9%. Based on our calculations, we found that a young millennial earning the median income in Portland can expect to pay about $5,645 in federal taxes and around $2,332 in state and local taxes.
(DaveAlan via Getty Images)
3. New York, New York
New York City is another city that’s notorious for its high tax rates. Our study reveals that a young millennial earning median income in the Big Apple (the average income across all five boroughs, based on population) would pay an overall effective tax rate of 24%. That adds up to about $9,138 in federal, state and local taxes.
(mikdam via Getty Images)
2. Chesapeake, Virginia
Census Bureau data reveals that the median household income for young millennials in Chesapeake is around $64,695. As a result, they have some of the highest tax bills among their counterparts nationwide. Our analysis shows that a young Chesapeake millennial earning median income will pay about $14,170 in federal taxes and around $3,227 in state and local taxes.

1. Arlington, Virginia

Our analysis reveals that six cities in our study (San Francisco, San Jose, Honolulu, New York, Arlington, Virginia and Portland, Oregon) rank as places where younger and older millennials pay the highest taxes. Older millennials also have high tax bills in six other cities, including Washington, D.C., Oakland and Fremont, California.
In terms of the cities where older millennials have the biggest tax burdens, we also had a three-way tie for 10th place. In Irvine, Santa Ana and Anaheim, California, older millennials who earn around $81,917 (the median household income for adults between the ages of 25 and 44) can expect to pay about $19,793 in federal taxes and $4,607 in state and local taxes.
Washington, D.C.
Oakland, California
Income tax rates in the state of California vary widely based on income. The poorest residents pay a marginal tax rate of 1% and the wealthiest residents face a marginal rate of 12.3%. In Oakland, the median household income for adults between the ages of 25 and 44 is nearly $90,500. Adults who earn the median income pay an overall effective tax rate of 30.9% (with federal taxes included).
Fremont, California
Fremont is located roughly an hour away from San Francisco, by car. The average older millennial earns around $90,499 per year and has a combined effective tax rate of 30.9%. That adds up to about $28,000 in federal, state and local taxes.
We made several assumptions throughout our study. For example, we assumed that a millennial would take the standard deduction and file taxes as a single filer claiming one exemption (meaning that he is not married and has no children). We also assumed that a typical millennial wouldn't make any pre-tax contributions to a 401(k) or another retirement account.

There isn't much North Korean media, but what little exists is full of images of nuclear destruction — of U.S. cities incinerated by North Korean nukes. News anchors promise that a coming conflict will leave Washington in "a sea of fire." A Communist party website warned Tuesday that Pyongyang is "waiting for the moment it will reduce the whole of the U.S. mainland to ruins."
North Korean propaganda has gotten so over-the-top that after that last headline, the Chinese urged the Koreans to pipe down. The Chinese Foreign Ministry suggested both the North and the U.S. should "remain calm and exercise restraint, stop irritating each other," which experts said was directed more at Pyongyang than D.C.

It all sounds very ominous, but is it? While the tempo of anti-U.S. rhetoric is higher than in past years, there hasn't been that much of a change in its content. As one U.S. intelligence official noted, there's always been "hyperbole and propaganda in their messaging."
In fact, say experts and U.S. officials, most of the rhetoric so widely replayed in Western media is not meant for the world stage but for internal consumption in the "hermit kingdom."
Still, at least one expert on North Korean propaganda said that while a lot of Pyongyang's rhetorical flourishes are "eminently mockable," they shouldn't be ignored.
1. While Kim Jong Un's birthday on January 8 is a national holiday, it is unknown exactly how old the North Korean leader is. It's widely believed he is in his early-mid thirties. In 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department listed his birth year as 1984 when they placed sanctions on North Korea.

Rodman has visited the secluded nation multiple times and even sang him "Happy Birthday" before an exhibition game in Jan. 2014.

5. Kim Jong Un's older half-brother Kim Jong Nam was killed in Feb. 2017 by two women who smeared VX nerve agent on his face at an airport in Kuala Lumpur. The women were arrested following his death. Many believe the hit was directed by North Korea.

"Their bluster now carries more weight," said Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo Korea Foundation Professor in Korean Studies at the Fletcher School. "We can patronize them, but when their ability to carry out such attacks gets close, when they show the technology, I think their threats become more credible."
Lee also said that outsiders "should not be reduced to patronizing a regime that is very cruel."
A second U.S. intelligence official said the recent increase in noise is about attention.
"They need it," said the official, noting they weren't getting it from the Obama administration. "So they've been pounding out stuff at a sustained pace for at least a year."
See Gallery
And the messaging can get even more personal. Lee points to attacks on President Obama and the recently impeached president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, in 2015. Obama, he said, was referred to as a "wicked black monkey" who should return to Africa "and feed off bread crumbs thrown by tourists" while Park was called a "dirty old whore." The North, Lee said, received criticism in the international community for its racist and sexist commentary.
Some of the more recent videos directed against the U.S. have high production values, with heavy use of graphics and animations.
One U.S. official said the videos are at once a throwback to earlier Cold War messaging and strangely au courant. He called them "almost post-modern, ironic rather than earnest."
There is a numbing sameness to North Korea's words and imagery, but the U.S. monitors the messages closely for any changes. As a second U.S. official said, if the Koreans stop talking about turning South Korea into a "sea of fire" and threaten something even more horrific, the intelligence community — and the world — need to take note.

Beyonce is setting the record straight on a report speculating that she got a cosmetic procedure done while pregnant with twins.
"What do you know about the effects of pregnancy on a woman's entire body? Please tell me," the statement reads, addressing the staffers at the website directly. "Did you know that in addition to weight gain there is often a dramatic change in the blood flow in the system and increased fluid causing swelling? Do you know that often women's gums get swollen? Do you know that it sometimes affects our speech, our ability to chew intently and a host of other things?"

"But the sacrifice to our faces, our feet and our entire bodies is something we welcome because we bring beautiful humans into the world who will one day combat your hate and negativity," the statement continues. "I stood silent during Beyonce's first pregnancy when you thought it was okay to bully her like the cowards you are, when you accused her of never being pregnant, but I simply cannot this time."
The statement ends with some even harsher words. "You are the saddest individuals and picking on a pregnant lady is tantamount to possessing the coldest, despicable heart," Noel-Schure says. "You need to find something else to do with your time and maybe stop by a store that has happiness on sale because you need to buy some.

Our daily life can be hectic and sometimes we long for convenient ways to save time and do less. Unfortunately, seeking convenience too often can cause you to overspend quite a bit.
Saving money is very convenient too and much better for your wallet and your financial goals. By planning ahead using savings strategies, we can save money on many daily purchases we tend to make and enjoy convenience in most cases. Let's put more money back into our pockets by saving money on these 50 common expenses many people tend to pay regularly.
Take a bit of extra time to withdraw money from your bank's ATM and save on the cost to withdraw your own cash or if your bank has a mobile app, use it to find an in-network ATM near you.
Many of us like to keep our loose change in a jar and let it collect over time. Once it's full, don't pay machines to count it for you, go to your bank to deposit your savings or have it exchange for cash.
Skip the line at the currency exchange or grocery store and pay online using checking account or debit card. Some companies charge to use a debit card, so schedule e-check payment, which is typically free.
Maintaining a balance on your card usually you to pay interest each month. Try to pay off your credit card balance in full each month or send more than the minimum payment. As always, use your credit cards responsibly.
I Raised My Credit Score By 150 Points, Here's How
Although it may be convenient, prices are always marked up when compared to other stores. So take the time to shop for food in advance at your grocery store and pack emergency snacks in your car.
Some vehicles may not require premium gas, which is the most costly of the gasoline grades. Stop trying to be fancy, check the owner's manual, and save.
You may not know this, but having low tire pressure affects your mileage significantly. Save gas and money by improving your gas mileage by simply checking your tire pressure and maintaining it at the proper level.
Many car wash places offer a flat monthly rate for unlimited washes, so check with your local car wash to find out if they offer a monthly rate and cash in on a clean car. Or, you can get a discount when you pump your gas.
According to the Powerball, the odds hitting the jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338.00, and CNN cites that Americans spent $70.15 billion in 2014. Let's save our hard-earned money.
A daily cup of joe adds up if you purchase it at places like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. Save by brewing at home.
It's a tough addiction to beat, but it is a very expensive to purchase cigarettes daily. Aside from causing deadly health effects, according to Time, smoking can cost you $1 to $2 million in a lifetime. Make an effort to better your health and wallet.
If your area doesn't charge for using plastic bags, reuse the ones you get from shopping as garbage bags. I do this all the time.
For those living in an area where stores charge for plastic bags (*cough cough Chicago*), bring your own reusable one. Those cents add up!
Reuse bags from previous occasions if they are still in good condition. We started doing this last year and no longer have to run out and by $3+ gift bags when we go to events or parties.
Take some time to make your own personal cards or send an eCard and skip on the expense.
For the frequent traveler, you should buy empty travel containers and refill with shampoo, lotion, etc. as needed.
Save money and paper by keeping up with free online news services.
In the digital age of music, don't pay for premium services. Streaming companies like SoundCloud and Spotify allow you to listen to music for free.
If you'd like to truly own a book, then save on the paper and extra cost by purchasing the digital version, or go to your local library and check them out for free.
Remember to return all materials on time. It'll save you money and allow for other library patrons to enjoy the material in a timely manner. If you do have library fees, wait for a month when they accept canned goods as a payment method (usually around the holidays).
Skip the early release and commotion of having the latest video game. Save major bucks by purchasing a used version of the game online or at stores like Game Stop.
Gaming apps are meant to entertain, and while most of them are free, don't fall for the "purchase bonus lives" trap. In-game purchases add up.
If you forget your charger and your phone needs to be charged, some time you'll be inclined to purchase a new one, but it can be costly or even poor quality. Always keep your charger handy, look for a charging station where you're at, or simply ask to borrow one.
Save on disposable batteries and purchase rechargeable ones. They can last up to two to three years.
Many offices, banks, insurance companies, etc, give them away for free. Save them and skip on the purchase.
Unless you're a student, you probably don't really need to buy a lot of paper – reuse already printed pages and use both sides.
While some families "grow into" their homes, sometimes less is more. Save on mortgage and the possibility of purchasing more for a larger home. Downsize and save.
If you pay for water utility bill, according to the EPA, fixing leaky faucets saves you 10% on your bill. By ignoring it, you not only lose money every day it goes unfixed, but you also waste clean water, at a rate of 10,000 gallons per year.
Save on heating and electric bills by fixing drafts and keep the warmth and cool in your home during the winter and summer.
Even though you may not use them often, electronics that are plugged in still consume energy. Unplug appliances you don't you often and keep other electronics on a power strip, turning them off when not in use.
Improve your health and wallet by not eating fast food often. It may be cheap, but it adds up, especially if you eat out a few times per week. Instead, spend the money and the time to grocery shop and prepare meals.
Sometimes you're running late for work and don't have time to pack a lunch. Buying lunch often costs much more than preparing and bring a meal to work. Spend some time planning, purchasing and preparing meals ahead of time so they're ready to go, even when you're in a hurry.
When you do go grocery shopping, sometimes the already-prepped sub or diced fruits and veggies tempt you to buy them and save time, but you'll be paying top dollar for those products. Plan a list ahead of time and buy the individual food items, then spend the time prepping them yourself in order to save.
Save money by skipping on the brand names, like medicine, toiletries, and certain foods. Remember that healthier options with fewer additives may cost more and in that case they may be worth it. Otherwise, generic is the way to go.
Products like toilet paper and soap have a long shelf life, so save on purchasing those often and buy in bulk.
You are purchasing these to eventually throw them out. Save on the waste and save money by buying reusable, washable towels and napkins. Your wallet and the environment will thank you.
Primetime showings are typically 2x higher than those during the day. Go to morning matinees or take advantage of weekly specials ($5 movie nights during the week).
Often times, movie theater food can cost more than the ticket to get in. Try to keep food purchases to a minimum when you can or eat a filling meal before you go see a movie.
Instead of spending money on purchasing the movie, subscribe to streaming services and find an alternative or go to your local library.
While having a spontaneous night out is fun, if you RSVP when possible, arrive early, or take advantage of online ticket sales, you can skip out on paying in full at your favorite nightlife places.
Your birthday is one of the best days to score free stuff like meals, drinks, desserts, tickets, services, etc. I wrote a whole roundup post on birthday freebies a while ago.
When you do dine out and if you have kids with you, be sure to take advantage of 'kids eat free' specials. Most restaurants have specific days of the week when they offer free kids meals.
You may not be able to cut out this expense completely if you have pets, but you can score free cans of pet food with coupons occasionally so you won't have to spend as much.
As you can see, there are many ways to save big on everyday expenses. How do you plan on cutting back and keeping more money in your wallet?

Matus and DeVoursney, a former Marine from Georgia, were found dead Monday in Belize. Authorities in the Central American country have named 54-year-old John Deshaies as the prime suspect.
But the friend of the suspected killer says police have the wrong man. The friend said Deshaies, the owner of a Canadian construction company, would never harm Matus.
The friend believes police targeted Deshaies because he left the country shortly after Matus and DeVoursney went missing.
Deshaies lived in the lower half of Matus' home in Belize. Matus, 52, was a Canadian real estate investor and split her time between Belize and Canada.
"Belize is a very corrupt country," the friend said. "I think they're actually keeping him in jail for his own safety. They want it to seem like it's a Canadian or American problem rather than a Belizean one."
DeVoursney, 36, and Matus, who had only been dating for a few months, were last seen alive at Scotty's Bar and Grill in Corozal. They were found dead in a field near the village of Chan Chen a week after they disappeared.
It was determined that Matus and DeVoursney had been strangled.

That doesn't mean some — like Bill Maher — aren't ready to lob some criticism, not necessarily at Kimmel but more at the ideas he presented. Thankfully, it has nothing to do with Kimmel's situation with his son — it would take a real heel to criticize that on television — but Maher does take exception with Kimmel's assertion that all sides land along the same lines on basic healthcare. When Kimmel says Republicans and Democrats all agree that "If your baby's going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make," Maher stops his audience from applauding and proceeds to rant:
"Unfortunately that's not true, One side wants to tax rich people so that babies don't have to die and one side is mostly against that. And this lets Republicans off the hook...
"Let's not f*ck around with this, we are not on the same page with this."
See photos of Bill Maher:
See Gallery
Maher sprinkled healthcare talk throughout Friday's show, kicking things off with a monologue that made fun of the celebration in The White House rose garden and saying that the GOP told Jimmy Kimmel's baby "go screw yourself." It also led to Maher dropping a New Rule that called out the folks who characterized the 2016 election as a "choice between the lesser of two evils." He includes plenty of other examples from Trump's first 100 days, including his many questionable cabinet positions, and proceeds to lecture all of the major names that seemed to put Clinton in the same basket with Trump.

Former first lady Michelle Obama recently revealed a surprising behind-the-scenes look at how her daughters decided to spend their last moments in the White House.
After enjoying a long vacation with husband and former president Barack Obama in the Virgin Islands, Michelle Obama returned with her first official public appearance since the Obamas left the White House three months ago at the American Institute of Architecture conference.
See Gallery
There, she shared how Malia and Sasha Obama -- 18 and 15 respectively -- bid farewell to their home of eight years. According to the first lady, they hosted a slumber party with friends, pizza and chicken nuggets.
"They had a sleepover, because of course on Inauguration Day, because my girls are so normal, they're like, 'Well, eight girls are gonna be sleeping here because it's our last time, and we want pizza and we want nuggets.' And it's like, really?," Michelle Obama said during the Thursday conference.
In reflecting on the girls' last night before Trump's inauguration, Obama said it was difficult for the girls to say goodbye to the White House.
"So that moment of transition, right before the doors opened and we welcomed in the new family, our kids were leaving out the back door in tears, saying goodbye to people," Obama said.
Obama joked that she had to maintain good face while welcoming the Trump family into the White House.
"I didn't want to have tears in my eyes because people would swear I was crying because of the new president," she said.
Obama also shared a funny note when reflecting on the Obama family's life outside of the White House.
"Friends are surprised I answer the door now," she explained, while also sharing that the Obama family's two furry members, dogs Bo and Sunny, have never even "heard a doorbell."

Ah, summer, you've been missed. We've been, er, itching for warmer days, weekend getaways and patio barbecues. Our days are soon to be exploding with afternoon happy hours, days on the lake, outdoor concerts and time with family and friends. If you couldn't tell, we cannot wait for summer to officially start.
Although most POW cases have been reported in the Great Lakes and Northeast, everyone should know how to protect themselves from ticks. From the type of socks to wear to the types of flowers to plant, here's how you can protect yourself.
1. Stay in the middle of the path
When hiking, make sure to stay in the middle of the path. Weeds, grass and trees make it easier for ticks to crawl onto you. Don't venture out to the grass or bushes, where ticks are formidable to be hiding. 
2. Wear long pants and closed toed shoes
Protect your skin. Adding an extra layer makes it more difficult to latch on to you. It's smart to wear pants, long sleeves and hats, especially in the summer.
3. Invest in deer-resistant plants. 
7. Stay in the sun.
5. Yes, repellant can help. 
4. Check your dog! 
Dogs can literally bring ticks right to your front door. Prevent ticks by keeping their coats short in the summer. Use your hands to check the fur, stopping if you feel a pea-sized bump. Favorite spots ticks like to hide include the ears, toes and under the tail. 
6. Dry your clothes 
Warning: Ticks can survive the wash. 
8. Tuck your pants into your socks.
This covers the small, easily accessible space in between your pants and ankles. Especially if you are sitting, it makes it easier for ticks to latch on. 
9. Invest in Permethrin socks
10. Mow your lawn
Cut your grass, clean your yard, get rid of any extra firewood or wood chips.

At 23 years old, zookeepers say an African elephant named Seeni is expecting and due this summer. Seeni was rescued from Botswana, along with two other females, and the handlers have been waiting for her to get pregnant.

Pittsburgh Zoo staff are thrilled at the news as her calf will be the first born at the facility since it opened in 2006. Even with good news, keepers say Seeni's is a high-risk pregnancy.

Tiny homes might seem ideal for those seeking a quieter, quainter lifestyle.
But imagine a tiny home being thrown in the middle of all the madness that is downtown Las Vegas — in the backyard of one of the most infamous party hotels, no less.
Though it might not be the source of rest and relaxation that most crave from tiny living, if there's anywhere to try something completely unorthodox, it's certainly Vegas!
The room boasts one bedroom with a queen-sized bed, a lofted full-sized bed and a pullout sleeper sofa, which allows the place to comfortably (questionable) sleep six guests.
See Gallery
If you're still not sold, get this — the home essentially doubles as a private "island" in the middle of an all-night party.
The structure is set up in "The Backyard" courtyard property of the Gold Spike hotel (the hotel's penthouse was the suite featured on MTV's "Real World" Season 31) which is essentially an adult dreamland — giant yard games like cornhole and Jenga, a music stage and of course, a bar.
"During the day, The Backyard is relatively tame. At night, however, the area can get downright rowdy—and the Sugar Shack is right in the center of the action."
Renting the Sugar Shack also means gaining access to a private front yard, essentially enabling VIP access to all of the festivities going on around you.
The countless windows and open air vibes of the structure always make you feel like you're the center of the party, even when you're just hanging out inside — and isn't that what most come to Vegas for, anyway?
Goes without saying that all guests must be 21 or older.
It's definitley not for the faint of heart, but for those wanting a through and through Las Vegas experience, this might be as close as you'll ever get — you truly never have to leave the party.

Big-box stores and warehouse clubs like BJ's, Costco and Sam's Club are a shopper's dream -- One-stop shops where you can buy a lifetime supply of your favorite foods and products. However, don't let every gargantuan carton and low price tag tempt you. Tons of items are better purchased in a 2-pack rather than a 24-pack.
1. Cooking oils
Cooking oils like olive oil and vegetable oil typically have shelf lives of only 6-12 months -- so stay away from the gallon-sized containers. 
2. Spices
While spices don't expire quickly, they tend to lose their potency after about 6 months. If you want to buy spices in bulk, stick to buying whole cloves and grind them up yourself to maintain those bold flavors. 
3. Liquid bleach
Bleach has a shelf life of about 6-12 months. The chemical begins to degrade immediately, especially at higher temperatures, so don't be tempted by the bigger packages.
4. Face cream and sunscreen
Lotions like moisturizer and sunscreen  tend to lose their effectiveness in about 3-6 months -- so stick to purchasing smaller bottles and restock a few times a year. 
5. Condiments
Condiments like ketchup, ranch dressing and mayonnaise are laden with preservatives to hold a longer shelf life -- but even so, it's usually 6-12 months. There's a good chance you won't finish your bottle before the expiration date, so stick to buying one bottle at a time. 
6. Brown rice
Brown rice deteriorates much faster than white or pre-cooked rice. Even when stored in an airtight container, brown rice only has a shelf life of about 6 months. 
7. Soda
Properly stored canned soda has a shelf life of about 9 months, but it may lose some carbonation and taste.
See Gallery
Be cautious in the cooking aisle. Cooking oils have a much shorter shelf life than you probably realize (only 3-6 months!) and ground spices lose their potency after about 6 months. White rice and other pre-cooked rices reportedly have a shelf life of 30 years -- but did you know brown rice expires after only 6 months?
Besides the obvious grocery staples that perish quickly -- like dairy products, produce and meat -- there are some other products to avoid buying in large quantities that you may not be aware of.
Hit up the grocery store instead for the above items -- or just stick to smaller packages.

No more Twitter for Kanye.
"He's focusing on getting back into the public spotlight really slow," a source told ET earlier this week. "That's the main reason why he didn't want to go to the Met Ball. He's still very close friends with Anna and loves her dearly, but right now it's all about him and staying healthy."

"He was thrilled that Kim was able to go and have fun," the source said. "But him staying at home with his children was something he wanted to do more."
Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian West, did go solo to the event, where she rocked a subdued white outfit, and confirmed her husband's absence from the event.

According to Allard, drug paraphernalia and prescription medication was located in the home near McNeely's body. There is no indication of foul play, however, Allard says there were signs of illegal drug use. McNeely's body has been transported to the West Virginia Medical Examiner for autopsy.

More than one-third of Americans say President Donald Trump is influencing how and where they decide to open their pocketbook.
"We may have lost at the ballot box, but we can vote at the cash register every day. I'm going to continue to reach out to these companies to let them know I'm not doing business with them until they sever their relationship with the Trump family."
Twenty-six percent of those who participated in the CNBC poll say they've made a political or charitable contribution based on Trump, CNBC reports, noting that "the vast majority" of those contributions are in opposition to the president.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Boko Haram militants have released dozens of schoolgirls out of a group of more than 200 whom they kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok in April 2014, officials said on Saturday.
A government minister, asking not to be named, said 82 girls had been released. Unconfirmed reports on social media put the number of freed girls at between 50 and 62.
"The girls were released through negotiations with the government," one official said, asking not to be named, adding that an official statement would follow shortly.
A military source said the girls were currently in Banki near the Cameroon border for medical checks before being airlifted to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.
The kidnapping was one of the high-profile incidents of Boko Haram's insurgency in Nigeria's northeast, now in its eighth year and with little sign of ending. About 220 were abducted from their school in a nighttime attack.
More than 20 girls were released last October in a deal brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Others have escaped or been rescued, but 195 were believed to be still in captivity before this release.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said last month that the government was in talks to secure the release of the remaining captives.
Although the Chibok girls are the most high-profile case, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of adults and children, many of whose cases have been neglected.
The militants have killed more than 20,000 people and displaced more than 2 million during their insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria.
Although the army has retaken much of the territory initially lost to Boko Haram, large parts of the northeast, particularly in Borno state, remain under threat from the militants. Suicide bombings and gun attacks have increased in the region since the end of the rainy season late last year.

A furry suspect caught on camera holding what appeared to be an assault rifle was lucky after escaping police by a whisker.
An Oregon resident alerted police after spotting a cat holding what appeared to be a firearm in its paws while posted up in a tree.

Police rushed to the scene to answer the bizarre call after receiving an image of the feline suspect toting the alarming object.
Once they arrived, law enforcement officials soon realized the photo of the would-be gangster puss was nothing more than an optical illusion.
The cat snapped in the photo was actually holding a tree branch that just looked a lot like a weapon, and the Newport Police Department reacted in style.
In a post on Facebook, the department wrote they issued the animal a "verbal warning."
Reports of an armed cat this morning were unfounded. The feline was contacted by our canine and was determined to be in...

Paying taxes on Earth is already a pain, but in California, you could one day be paying that extra fee in space. The state's franchise tax board wants the public to weigh in on the idea.
Its proposal would compute taxes on commercial space transportation companies. Basically, any company operating in California that makes half of their money from space transportation. They say it is any travel 62 miles above the surface of the Earth.
Alabama residents pay less in property taxes than residents in any other state due to low median home values and the second-lowest property tax rate. Alabama residents have 23.66 percent of income going toward taxes, with a median household income of $44,509.
Arizona falls in the bottom half of states for total taxes paid by its residents, who see 24.58 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes. Property taxes and gas taxes paid in this state are lower than the national average.
Arkansas has one of the highest sales tax rates in the nation, at 9.3 percent. However, residents pay less in income taxes and gas taxes than the national average. Plus, the average property tax bill in Arkansas is among the lowest in the nation due to low median home values and a low tax rate.
California residents pay more in taxes than residents of most other states. In fact, 31 percent of their income, on average, goes toward taxes. Considering that the cost of living in California also is high, it's no wonder it's one of the states where residents are most likely to live paycheck to paycheck, according to one GOBankingRates study.
Colorado residents pay more in taxes than the national average of $14,998.83 — and pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes, on average. The reason: high income and sales taxes. Gas and property taxes paid in Colorado, on th other hand, are lower than the national average.
Connecticut residents pay more in income taxes than any other state, in part due to a high median income of $72,889. Average property taxes paid in the state also are about double the national average of $2,118.08. In addition to high taxes, residents also are faced with a high cost of living in Connecticut.
Delaware is one of the most tax-friendly states, with residents paying just 21.99 percent of their income toward taxes. One of the key reasons the total tax bill is low here is because there is no sales tax. Plus, the average property tax paid is nearly half the national average.
Washington, D.C., residents pay more in property taxes, on average, than residents in most states due to a high median home value of $540,400. Residents also pay more in income taxes, on average, than any other state, with the exception of Connecticut.
On the plus side, the sales tax rate of 5.75 percent is below the national average. Residents also pay less than the national average to fill up their gas tanks.
The total taxes paid in Georgia are lower than the national average of $14,998.83. However, taxes actually consume a higher percentage of residents' income than the national average because of a low median income of $50,768 in the state.
Hawaii residents have to pay a hefty tax bill to live in paradise. Total taxes paid are among the top 10 highest in the nation — due, in large part, to high income taxes. Residents earning a median household income of $64,514 pay around $14,798.36 in income taxes.
On the plus side, property and sales taxes in Hawaii are lower than the national average.
Total taxes paid in Idaho — $14,012.17 — are slightly below the national average. However, residents pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes than the national average due to the state's low median income.
Hefty property and sales taxes contribute to a high total tax bill in Illinois. In fact, the average property tax bill is more than 50 percent higher than the national average — even though the median home value is below the national average. Overall, Illinois residents pay nearly 30 percent of their income, on average, toward taxes.
Indiana is a relatively tax-friendly state. The average total tax bill is lower than the national average because income and property taxes are lower in Indiana than in most other states.
Average property taxes paid in Kansas are relatively low due to a less-than-stellar median home value. Average income taxes paid also are below the national average because of the state's low median wage. However, Kansas residents are hit by a high sales tax, which is 8.62 percent versus the national average 6.47 percent.
Kentucky has the fourth-lowest average tax burden in this study. All taxes paid — income, sales, property and gas — are well below the national average. Income and property taxes paid are particularly low, on average, due to the state's low median income and property value.
Average property taxes paid in Louisiana are among the lowest in the nation, as are income taxes due to the state's low median income of $45,922. Further, Louisiana has a higher-than-average sales tax of 9.98 percent.
Total taxes paid in Maine are lower than the national average. But that doesn't mean residents don't face high taxes. Total taxes paid consume nearly 27 percent of residents' pay, on average, due to the state's low median income.
Maryland residents pay more in taxes than residents in all but three states. This is largely due to the high income taxes paid in this state, which has the third-highest median income in the nation.
Michigan's property tax rate is higher than the national average. However, a low median home value helps keep down the average property taxes paid in the state. Income and sales taxes paid also are lower than the national average.
On average, nearly 30 percent of what Minnesota residents earn goes toward income, property, sales and gas taxes. Average income taxes paid are particularly high, compared with other states.
Mississippi residents pay the lowest total tax bill in the nation. Income taxes paid here are the second lowest in the country due to the state's low median income of $40,037. Plus, property taxes paid are among the lowest in the nation as a result of a low tax rate and median home value.
The total tax bill in Missouri is only slightly higher than the national average of $14,998.83, due to income and sales taxes that are higher than the average paid nationwide. However, property and gas taxes in Missouri are well below the national average paid.
Montana is just one of four states with no sales tax. Property and income taxes also are lower than the national average. As a result, Montana residents see just 22.28 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes.
The total tax bill in Nebraska is higher than the national average. In large part, it's because residents pay more in income taxes as a result of a higher-than-average median income. Nonetheless, residents pay, on average, an amount equal to about 28 percent of their income.
New Hampshire has no sales tax. It also doesn't have a state income tax, but the average amount of federal income taxes paid by residents is high because the state has the highest median income in the nation. Residents also pay more in property taxes than the national average paid. In fact, New Hampshire has the second-highest property tax rate in the U.S., after New Jersey.
New Jersey residents pay the highest total tax bill in the nation. They also pay the highest percentage of income toward taxes — 33.17 percent, on average. The biggest reason the tax burden is so high in New Jersey is the state's 2.13 percent property tax rate, which is more than twice as high as the national average rate.
Total taxes paid in New Mexico are among the lowest in the nation. Property and income taxes paid are well below the national average. This is due, in large part, to a low median income and a low median home value in the state.
Like their New Jersey neighbors, New York residents pay more than 30 percent of their income toward taxes. Residents pay a lot on the state's high sales tax of 8.49 percent and property tax of 1.38 percent.
The total tax bill in North Carolina is lower than the national average thanks to lower-than-average property and income taxes. However, residents pay more in gas taxes.
North Dakota residents have a lower total tax bill than the national average, paying around $13,381.61 every year. Gas and property taxes are lower than the national average, too.
Although the property tax rate in Ohio is higher than the national average, property taxes paid fall below the national average due to the state's low median home value of $125,300. Ohio residents also pay slightly less in income taxes overall, forking over just under $9,000 annually.
Oklahoma has one of the lowest total tax bills in the nation. Income and property taxes are well below the national average because median income and the median home value are among the lowest in the U.S. However, residents are hit by a high 8.86 percent state sales tax.
Oregon is just one of four states without a sales tax. Still, residents pay just over 28 percent of their income toward taxes. They face a high income tax bill.
Rhode Island residents pay over 29 percent of their income toward taxes. The big tax bite is due primarily to the state's high property tax rate of 1.51 percent. Income and sales taxes, on the other hand, are on par with the national average.
South Carolina's total tax bill is among the lowest in the nation. Residents pay below-average income, gas and property taxes. Its sales tax, however, is above average at 7.22 percent.
South Dakota has no income tax, which helps keep residents' total tax bill below the national average. Property and sales taxes paid also are slightly below the national average.
Tennessee has no state taxes on income, but it makes up for it with a high sales tax rate of 9.46 percent — the second highest in this study. The average property taxes paid, on the other hand, are half the national average.
The overall tax bill in Utah is higher than the national average due to high income taxes paid by residents. However, the state does offer a high median household income of about $66,000. Meanwhile, the state's property tax rate is just 0.64 percent, compared to the national average of 1.02 percent.
Vermont residents pay more in property taxes than residents in most other states. As a result, total taxes paid in this state nearly top $18,000, far higher than the national average.
Virginia residents have a higher income tax bill than the national average, paying just over $12,600. But it's due, in part, to the state's median income, which is higher than the national average. Sales, gas and property taxes are all lower than national averages.
Washington has no income tax. However, residents are liable to pay a lot in income taxes thanks to the state's high median household income of $67,243. The state sales tax is also high, at 8.92 percent.
The total tax bill in West Virginia is the second lowest in the nation, after Mississippi. The typical property tax bill is also the second lowest in the nation, due to the state's low property tax rate of 0.53 percent and a low home value of $102,400.
Wisconsin residents pay a higher overall tax bill than the national average because of the state's high income and property taxes. In fact, Wisconsin is among the top 10 states that take the most out of your paycheck.
Residents of this tax-friendly state pay only about 20 percent of their income toward taxes — the lowest percentage in the nation. Wyoming has no state income tax, and property and sales taxes in the state are well below national averages.

Now, the reason the board created the rules is to let entrepreneurs know the state's tax code will be ready once business takes off. And, figuring out the amount of tax is actually pretty simple. The farther away from Earth you go means the less tax you pay. While the closer you are means more tax.
A public hearing on the rules is set for June 16th.

Cyrus says making the change was "easy." "When I want something, it's f–king easy for me," she said. "But if anyone told me not to smoke, I would have not done it. It's because it was on my time. I know exactly where I am right now."
Though she made this decision to quit "for a second" for herself, she was motivated in part by the people around her.

I want to be super clear and sharp because I know exactly where I want to be."

Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd said that the C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, is set to become the new star of its 600-plus aircraft fleet, stating that its "safety and state-of-the-art design will bring superb a flying experience to its passengers".
In a written reply to China Daily, the Shanghai-based airline, which is expected to be the first carrier to take delivery of the homegrown single-aisle passenger jet, said it was "extremely confident about the future of the C919".
China Eastern pre-ordered 20 C919s from the aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd in 2010, and according to the purchase agreement, negotiations for the ordering of the first five planes will be launched within a year of the C919's maiden flight.
China Eastern is one of the nation's top three airlines, serving more than 100 million passengers in flights to 177 nations and regions in 1,062 destinations every year.
ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, the subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, announced its intention to purchase 45 C919 aircraft in October 2011. ICBC Financial Leasing is looking to support COMAC with joint marketing, market surveys, signing more orders and all-around financial services in the future, said Xu Qing, deputy CEO of ICBC Leasing.
"C919 will serve the most attractive market. The aircraft will be used in the domestic market, the Asia-Pacific region and the African market in its early days. By continuously optimizing the aircraft's performance, the C919 will go global in the future," said Xu.
With regard to the two dominant commercial aircraft makers－Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE－she suggested the future C919 should pay more attention to service at the beginning to build up its brand first.
"It's important to pay attention to customer support and services, and enhance product quality and stability. Overseas marketing should be based on continuously optimized products and services, an efficient maintenance support, and efficiency of operations," said Xu.

A visitor poses for a photo on the glass bridge, in August. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
Editor's note: During the just-concluded May Day holiday, "glass paths" became the new buzzword in the tourism sector. Two experts share their views with China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang on the mushrooming of glass-bottomed walkways over gorges in scenic spots across China.
Are the 'glass paths' worth the trouble?




Glass-bottomed bridges were first built between two cliffs so that people could enjoy the scenery around while being aware of the scary depth of the ravine below. For example, in Baishi Mountain Geological National Park in Baoding, North China's Hebei province, a 95-meter-long, 2-meter-wide glass-bottomed walkway was built at an average altitude of 1,900 meters to allow visitors to experience the beautiful but stomach-churning scenery below.
The problem is that glass-bottomed walkways have mushroomed across China. Search glass-bottomed walkways on domestic tourism website tuniu.com, and you will find that 24 cities have built such "glass paths" as their tourist sites. And since a majority of the "glass paths" have been built across valleys bereft of natural beauty, one cannot but question the wisdom to build them.
The rush to build "glass paths" shows the officials in the domestic tourist sites lack creativity. Instead of using the inherent advantages of the tourist sites, they are busy copying ideas and examples from others. Such homogenization fails to meet tourists' diversified demands.
More importantly, the glass needed for the glass-bottomed walkways is expensive and the total cost of such a bridge can run into several million yuan, and some tourist sites may fail to earn enough revenue to cover the expenses, let alone make profits, which would be a waste of tourism resources. And any compromise with the quality of the glass or the overall glass-bottomed bridge could spell trouble.
Liu Simin, vice-president of tourism at Beijing-based Chinese Society for Future Studies
Such bridges need total safety system
No major accidents have been reported from glass-bottomed walkways. And many tourism sites claim double-or multi-layered armored glass, which is three to four times stronger than ordinary glass, have been used to build such walkways.
But good safety records do not necessarily guarantee safety in the future. There is a national standard for the glass used in outer parts of structures (as a curtain wall for a building for example) but no special standard for the glass used in glass-bottomed walkways. I do not mean to raise unnecessary alarm, but without a national standard no one can ensure safety forever on the "glass paths".
Besides, people tend to equal the risk with glass-bottomed bridges to the cracking of glass and people falling into the ravines. But that is not the only risk.
On April 9, the overcrowding on a glass-bottomed bridge in Mulanshengtian tourism zone in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, amidst heavy rainfall caused an accident in which one person died and three were injured. The incident should be a lesson for us. Regular safety checks must be conducted to test the strength and durability of such walkways, while the maintenance and supervision staff should be fully trained to know under what conditions the walkways should be closed and how to deal with emergencies.
Besides, not everybody is fit to walk on such "glass paths", because looking down into a deep ravine might raise a person's blood pressure, increasing the risk of a heart attack. In fact, several reports have said tourists started crying out in fear on such walkways. The tourist sites with such walkways should therefore display clear safety instructions so that visitors know the risks and people with unfavorable health conditions stay away from them.
Only a comprehensive safety system can ensure tourists' safety on glass-bottomed bridges.

WITH THE PRICE OF GARLIC SPROUTS plummeting due to oversupply, some farmers in Henan province have reportedly discarded their harvest of garlic sprouts, a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Thursday:
The local governments in Henan have acted quickly to the overstock by pledging to set up a garlic association to nip oversupply in the bud. But what happened in Henan indicates once again how easy it is for farmers to fall prey to price fluctuations.
That some have urged the market to play its part at the cost of "non-market minded" farmers is hardly helpful. Farmers do not necessarily have to pay the price for being unaware of how the market works and when they should increase or reduce their production. Local agricultural officials are obliged to intervene if need be and guide farmers through these dark waters, rather than sit on the sidelines.
The roller coaster price alterations of Chinese agricultural products can be devastating to farmers, yet they are not uncontrollable.
Home to a relatively mature and stable agricultural market, the United States can offer a lesson or two on balancing supply and demand.
The food produced by one US farmer can feed about 155 people, and one-fifth of the country's food products are exported to the rest of the world. In recent decades, the US has rarely suffered from an excessive supply of soybeans, oranges, or milk thanks to its efficient supply chain, at the core of which is its agricultural cooperatives.
Cooperatives enable farmers to own and control, on a democratic basis, the procurement of supplies and services, and the selling of their products.
This should be heeded by many local governments in China, which either step back letting the market take over or improvise countermeasures such as initiating emergency buying in the face of an oversupply. Neither approach is a cure to the problems facing Chinese farmers.
The nationwide promotion of cooperatives seems to have yet to reach Henan's local governments, which only began discussing the possibility of establishing a garlic association after farmers threw their hard-earned harvest away.
Establishing online exchange platforms could also better prepare farmers for unexpected market changes.

PARIS - The French electoral commission, which supervises the country's presidential race, on Saturday warned local media not to republish data and information hacked from centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign staff.
In a statement, the commission asked media not to report the content of the leaked documents on their websites, stressing that publishing false information would be punished under criminal law.
Late on Friday, Macron's campaign team said it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
The leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, it added.
However, the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation," according to Macron's En Marche! (On the Move!) party.
The alleged hacking of the leading political party in the presidential race came on the eve of the election's run-off on Sunday.
Pollsters predict Macron to beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen with large margin.
In February, Macron's staff said their campaign had been the target of cyber attacks targeting databases and e-mail servers.

Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia, on Wednesday.Alexander Zemlianichenko / Reuters
SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions."
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back".
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors.
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being.
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions.
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership."
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.

A total of up to 20 billion yuan could be paid at the provincial level as bonuses
Beijing will offer rewards to nine provinces that exceeded their capacity cut targets in 2016, financed by a portion of the 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) subsidy allotted to help address overcapacity, Xu Hongcai, assistant finance minister, said on Friday.
Rewards for good performance will facilitate overall progress in cutting overcapacity this year, but less-developed areas that face greater difficulties with economic restructuring also need more financial help, experts said.
Local governments and enterprises in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will receive money for going beyond capacity cut targets in the steel sector. Chongqing, and Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces will receive grants for cuts in the coal sector, Xu said.
"The final amount given to each province will be revealed after the central government verifies the performance of each province last year," Xu said. "We will make sure that the allocation of money is transparent."
The total amount of the rewards would amount to a maximum of 20 percent of 100 billion yuan in special funds established in 2016, Xu said. The remaining 80 percent would be allotted to all regions to help with capacity cuts, he said.
Xu did not provide details on when the amounts will be announced or how the money will be spent.
"The central government's financial support is vital in helping the province achieve the capacity cut target because relocating workers and business restructuring are very costly," said Ji Jinghang, curator of Hangzhou Low-Carbon Museum in Zhejiang province.
Zhejiang's developed and balanced economy allows its laid-off workers to find jobs more easily than those in less-developed places such as in the economically lagging northeastern region.
Zhejiang ranked 14th nationwide in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017, with an 8 percent year-on-year growth rate, while Jilin province, saddled with heavy capacity cut targets, registered 2.4 percent growth during the same quarter.
Zhejiang plans to cut 2 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2020, while the target set for the steel sector this year alone in Jilin is 800,000 tons, according to provincial government documents.
Cheng Gong, a senior China National Coal Association analyst, said economically lagging regions need more financial support from the central government than last year because local governments face higher pressure to achieve targets.

Students from Guangxi University of Science and Technology play with pupils in Tantou township, Liuzhou city, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in July. English, dancing, painting and calligraphy classes were held for the pupils during summer vacation. Tan Kaixing / for China Daily
The pupils are watched by tens of thousands of people nationwide. It reminds us of the movie The Truman Show, where the main character lives in an artificial mini-world where he is watched by a worldwide audience around the clock.
The difference is, at the end of the movie Truman escapes from the artificial world in which he has been living, but the pupils are still being watched by audiences nationwide even though the media has exposed the voyeurism.
Legally speaking, school authorities that install cameras in classrooms and dormitories and provide video to live broadcast websites violate pupils' rights, because they invade the children's privacy without their consent.
According to reports, some of the schools argued they obtained consent from the pupils' parents when installing the cameras. The problem is, even though the pupils are minors they have the right to their own privacy, and so the consent of their parents is not valid. More important, the schools did not tell the parents that videos would be provided to live broadcast websites to be streamed nationwide.
Some "experts" have even claimed the pupils are attending a class and classrooms are public areas, so such broadcasts are not infringing on their privacy. Such opinions are nonsense because they totally ignore the pupils' legal right to privacy and the fact that classrooms are not public spaces to which everyone has the right of access.
China has been constantly improving the rule of law and made many achievements in the past few years. But it seems, teachers and schools need reminding they must respect the legal rights of their pupils. If the pupils realize their privacy and legal rights are being violated in such a way, how can they trust the rule of law?

China National Chemical Corp, also known as ChemChina, said on Friday that shareholders of Syngenta AG, the Swiss agrochemical and seed producer, have accepted its $43 billion takeover bid, paving the way for completion of China's biggest international acquisition deal.

Based on preliminary numbers, 80.7 percent of shares were tendered in favor of the acquisition, higher than the minimum acceptance rate of 67 percent needed for the deal to go through, ChemChina said in a statement

The first payment settlement is scheduled for May 18.

The Chinese company plans to delist Syngenta's shares in Switzerland and the United States at an appropriate time.

"The completion of this deal will help ChemChina become one of the world's largest suppliers of pesticides and other crop-care chemicals," said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing.

However, Ding said Dow Chemical Co's merger with DuPont Co and Bayer AG's purchase of Monsanto Co, which occurred in the past two years, would continue to provide intense market competition with ChemChina, as the top six international suppliers including Syngenta and BASF SE, have all been vying for market share and financial resources to push research and development of new products.

Zhang Xiaoping, director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said China could use Syngenta's deep experience and resources in intellectual property, risk control and environmental management to bring its products to global markets.

"On the other hand, Syngenta will have better access than other global companies to sell its products in our domestic markets," said Xu Hongcai, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.

"China's pesticide industry is riddled with low profitability and only global scale can improve that."

The government pins high hopes on the reform to solve structural issues in the agricultural sector, where some agricultural products are oversupplied while others rely heavily on imports.

China has been encouraging its companies to use both domestic and global resources to ensure the country's grain and food security in its agricultural policy.

Niu Dun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said earlier this year that the deal would generate a positive outcome for China to upgrade its abilities in grain and food production, supply chain building and processing.

Syngenta has 28,000 employees in more than 90 countries and regions. Its sales revenue dropped 1 percent year-on-year to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017.

Beijing-headquartered ChemChina possesses production, research and development, and marketing systems in 150 countries and regions. Materials sciences, life sciences, high-end manufacturing and basic chemicals are its main businesses.

It also acquired nine companies in France, the United Kingdom, Israel, Italy and Germany.

Two Chinese geological parks were approved on Friday to enter the Global Geoparks Network established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The two parks, Arxan National Geopark and Koktokay National Geopark, are located respectively in northwest China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Arxan National Geopark in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region is characterized by its landscape of volcanoes and hot springs and a large variety of lava formations, such as rocks and volcanic crater lakes.
Koktokay National Geopark is located in the Altay Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It has a large area of mining pits, with deposits of over 80 kinds of minerals. The park is also well-known for the granite landscapes and an earthquake fault zone.
A total of eight geoparks were approved to enter the network on Friday, with the others scattered in Spain, France, Iran, Mexico and South Korea. The new approval raises the total number in the list to 127.

James passes Abdul-Jabbar mark as Cavs crush Raptors
CLEVELAND - Unstoppable. Untouchable. Undefeated.
Back on the playoff stage, where he's starred so many times before, LeBron James is making things look easy.
James scored 39 points, passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time career playoff scoring list and pushed the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 125-103 blowout over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday night.
Just like a year ago in the conference final, the Cavs are up 2-0 on the Raptors, who had better figure some things out or this series will be over quickly.
Toronto was blown out for the fifth straight time in Cleveland in the playoffs, losing each by an average of 24.2 points.
Game 3 is on Friday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre.
James, who has won a road game in 27 consecutive series, appears determined to toss Toronto aside. He finished 10 of 14 from the field, dropped four 3-pointers and 15 free throws.
"He did miss six free throws," cracked Toronto's Kyle Lowry. "He's playing unbelievable. He's playing like LeBron James."
In Cleveland's past nine playoff wins, James is averaging 34.9 points, 10 rebounds and 8.1 assists.
Kyrie Irving had 22 points and 11 assists and Channing Frye scored 18 points for the reigning champions, who are 6-0 so far defending their title. Cleveland is 9-0 since losing Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals.
The Raptors didn't start Jonas Valanciunas, but he led them with 23 points. Toronto only got five points from All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who didn't make his first field goal until the first minute of the fourth quarter.
Of bigger concern might be the status of Lowry, who sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. He scored 20 points but spent the fourth quarter in the locker room icing his ankle.
"It's pretty sore," Lowry said after limping to the postgame podium. "I'm going to get treatment and get ready for Game 3."
James came in needing 25 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, and he overtook the Hall of Fame center with a 3-pointer in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped the Cavs open a 26-point lead.
James (5,777 points) now only trails Michael Jordan (5,987), the player to whom he has been compared since he was a teenager, for the most points in postseason history.
James is also trying to match Jordan's six titles. He's halfway there, and the way the Cavs are playing, he could have No 4 before long.
Raptors coach Dwane Casey promised the Raptors "would be a different team tonight coming out".
He started a smaller lineup, benching the 7-foot Valanciunas and forward DeMarre Carroll in favor of guard Norman Powell and forward Patrick Patterson.
Casey also moved Serge Ibaka from power forward to center.
The moves were intended to give Toronto more ball handlers and open the floor on offense.
They didn't work, simply because the Raptors couldn't contain James.
Casey, though, is confident his team can go home and even the series.
"I believe in our players," he said. "I believe in our guys. I know there is another level we can get to. I've seen it before."
It won't matter if James raises his, too.
Milestone
James also became the fourth player with 300 career 3-pointers in the postseason, joining Ray Allen (385), Reg-gie Miller (320) and Manu Ginobili (312).
On his 40th birthday, coach Tyronn Lue said the best gift would be a win. But the former NBA journeyman, who won two titles and played for seven teams, reflected on the milestone.
"A little kid from Mexico (Missouri) with just dreams and hopes," he said.
"You never thought it would come true, but I worked hard and I'm here and I'm just blessed."

Swiss President Doris Leuthard speaks during an interview with Xinhua in Bern, Switzerland, on Jan 12, 2017. She is expected to attend the Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15. [Photo/Xinhua]
GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.

BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.

Higuain brace has Italians eyeing Cardiff
MONACO - Gonzalo Higuain urged his Juventus teammates to keep their feet on the ground after he scored both goals in a brilliant 2-0 win in Monaco on Wednesday that left the Italian squad on the brink of the Champions League final.
Argentine striker Higuain was set up by Dani Alves to open the scoring in the 29th minute, then converted an Alves cross just before the hour as Juve claimed a crucial victory in the semifinal first leg at Stade Louis II.
The Italian champion has the final in Cardiff on June 3 in its sights, with a showdown against holder Real Madrid, Higuain's former side, looking probable.
"The dream we have been pursuing since August has been to get to Cardiff and we are just one step away," said Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season following his $98 million transfer from Napoli.
"We have not won anything yet, so we mustn't get carried away," added Higuain, who ended a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages.
"I stayed calm. I knew everyone had faith in me and that hard work is always rewarded in the end."
Juventus shone in all areas against a Monaco side that has lit up Europe this season with a thrilling brand of attacking soccer.
Buffon still strong
But the host found Juve's defense rock solid, with Gianluigi Buffon majestic as ever in goal.
The 39-year-old, making his 149th European appearance, denied Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao in the first half and produced a stunning fingertip stop on Valere Germain late in the second.
Juventus, which welcomes Monaco to Turin for the second leg next Tuesday, has now gone over 10 hours without conceding in the Champions League and Buffon has blanked the opposition in five matches in the knockout rounds.
"In every game I want to show that I deserve to play at this level despite my age," said Buffon, twice a losing finalist in the Champions League.
"I work hard every day for this. The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it.
"We had the right approach. They are a fearsome team and the only way to beat them was playing the way we did."
Buffon also praised coach Massimiliano Allegri for his decision to bring Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defense, thwarting Monaco's attack and allowing Alves to wreak havoc down the right.
"Gigi showed that he is still a great goalkeeper. He always does it in big games, and Higuain scored two lovely goals," said Allegri.
"But to get results, everyone needs to work hard. You need to make sacrifices and track back and he did that too."
'More clinical'
Juventus could wrap up a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this weekend, when it faces city rival Torino, while Lazio awaits in the Italian Cup final.
To put its performance in the principality into context, Monaco had won its previous 13 home games and scored in 41 consecutive matches at Stade Louis II since November 2015.
"They were more clinical than us - with two or three chances they scored and we couldn't put any of ours away. Buffon made some incredible saves," said Monaco head coach Leonardo Jardim, who sorely missed injured marauding leftback Benjamin Mendy.
Now Monaco must attempt to become just the third team ever to overturn a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League.
"It is difficult, but we need to keep believing. The best thing is to believe it is possible, even if we only have a five percent chance," Jardim added.
In the meantime, Monaco will switch its focus back to its attempt to win the French title.
It plays Nancy on Saturday and needs two wins from its last four league games to become champion.

As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.

Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."

China's foreign trade is expected to sustain an upward trend in the near future, as more export-oriented companies focus on developing new levels of competitiveness, according to the spokesman of the nation's biggest trade event.
"Chinese exporters are no longer manufacturers focusing on intensive production and lower pricing to compete in the global market," said Xu Bing, spokesman of the Canton Fair.
The Canton Fair－held twice a year and known as the China Import and Export Fair－concluded on Friday in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou with reported total transactions at the spring fair increasing by 6.9 percent year-on-year to 206.357 billion yuan ($30 billion).
"Development of new competitiveness－including technology, brands, quality and services－is reasons behind the increased transactions for Chinese exporters," said Xu, also deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
There were 196,490 overseas buyers from 213 countries and regions visiting the fair, a rise of 5.87 percent year-on-year.
"We can see that more companies participating in the Canton Fair displayed products with higher quality and design, which offer high added values and are more competitive in the global market," Xu added.
The spokesman said more companies were attaching importance to innovation and building overseas branding and sales centers.
Transactions at the brand exhibition areas during the fair increased by 16.9 percent year-on-year to $10.9 billion, accounting for 36.3 percent of the total.
Su Cheng, general manager of Taizhou Chenghao Machine Mould Co Ltd, said Chinese homegrown moulds, which are of high quality with competitive prices, had also been sold to developed markets.
"The demand for Chinese moulds has been increasing recently in developed markets, which are traditionally powerhouses for high-quality industrial moulds," said Su.
According to Su, the company's moulds have been sold in major markets like the United States, Japan and Russia.
"The demand from developed markets began steadily increasing from the second half of last year. We are making efforts to developing high-quality moulds to satisfy the demand," said Su.
The Zhejiang-based company, which is mainly engaged in production and sale of moulds for industrial air conditioners, also develops garden pots which can automatically water flowers.

PARIS - Polling stations opened on France's European mainland on Sunday for a decisive round of the presidential election between centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-rightist Marine Le Pen.
More than 66,000 polling stations in the French European mainland opened at 08:00 local time (0600 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 20:00 (1800 GMT) in big cities, while the rest will close at 19:00 (1700 GMT).
Nearly 47 million voters are expected to cast their ballots.
French voters in overseas territories casted their votes on Saturday, but the results will be only known after all votes are casted on the mainland.
Official campaigning period ended Friday night, signalling the start of a blackout on any campaigning activities, according to French electoral law.
The law bans the publication of any early poll or counting results of the vote before all polling stations are closed.
Preliminary projections of the voting results are expected to be revealed by various sources after 20:00.
Macron and Le Pen topped the first round vote of the election on April 23, with 24.01 percent and 21.30 percent of votes, respectively.
Several major French opinion polls conducted after the first round have been consistent, which estimate that former economy minister Macron is likely to win the runoff after an intense campaign against Le Pen.

Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also known as the Forbidden City, will expand the sale of online tickets on a trial basis in July.
The trial run will last from July to October to test the feasibility of online sales of tickets for everyday, but tourists can still buy tickets at the entrances, according to the museum.
After the trial period, the Palace Museum will decide whether to phase out the sale of paper tickets and sell all tickets via the internet.
The all online sale may begin during the last 10 days of October.
By the May Day holiday in 2018, the museum may offer tickets for different periods throughout a day, in a bid to avoid too many tourists at a time.
Currently, tourists can only book tickets online in advance, but they have to buy paper tickets at the entrances if they want to visit immediately.
The Palace Museum began selling tickets online in September 2011. Currently about 50 percent of its tickets are sold online, with up to 70 percent booked online during holidays.
The Palace Museum started to set a daily visitor cap of 80,000 on June 13, 2015. The cap was triggered 32 times in 2015, 48 in 2016, and 10 in 2017.
Three steps to phase out sale of paper tickets
Phase 1: Preparation
Date: May - June
Starting from May, the museum will allow online selling of tickets for everyday, after an upgrade of its online ticket selling system.
Phase 2: Trial run
Date: July - October
The trial will test the feasibility of online sales of tickets, but tourists can also buy tickets at the entrances. Tourists can also buy tickets by scanning a QR code at the entrances.
Phase 3: Implementation
Date: From last 10 days of October
A full online sale will be carried out at a proper date, when no paper tickets will be offered at the entrances anymore.

C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily]
The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry.
With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft.
Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls.
Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft.
All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials.
These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919.
Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei."
Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane.
"The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said.
"Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said.
By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast.
Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035.
After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years.
So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates a point during her victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci at last week's WTA Stuttgart Grand Prix. Reuters
LONDON - Maria Sharapova might have to wait until June 20 to see if she will be welcomed back to Wimbledon this year.
Sharapova, the 2004 champion at the All England Club, returned to the WTA Tour last week after serving a 15-month ban for doping and reached the semifinals in Stuttgart, leaving her ranked No 262.
The Russian's return has sparked controversy on the tour, with some rivals saying she has been given preferential treatment.
The former world No 1 is set to play two more events, in Madrid and Rome, before the deadline for direct entry to Wimbledon qualifying.
Deep runs at those events could earn her enough points to make the main draw, while she will also find out on May 16 if she gets a wild card for the French Open.
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said on Wednesday there will be a meeting of the tournament's sub-committee on June 20, when it will be clear which players have been accepted into the main draw.
Wimbledon begins on July 3, its latest start since 1895.
Andy Murray, the world's No 1 men's player, said he expects Sharapova to be granted a wild card if she needs one.
"But I'm sure they are hoping they don't have to make the decision," Murray said at the launch of the Queen's Club tournament, a warm-up event for Wimbledon.
"There's a good chance that she can get in by right, which I'm sure is what she's hoping for and that's what Wimbledon would be hoping for."
Lewis said qualifying at nearby Roehampton would be a ticketed event for the first time, and that action on one of the courts will be broadcast live.
He said this was not linked to the possible appearance of Sharapova, but because of the upsurge in interest in qualifying matches.
Lewis also announced there will be a 12.5 percent increase in total Wimbledon prize money, to $40.8 million.
Winners of the singles titles will each pocket $2.85 million, a 10 percent increase from 2016.
First-round losers will receive $45,000, a 16.7 percent increase from 2016, as Wimbledon officials say they are placing more emphasis on helping lower-ranked players.
In another development, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said two-time Wimbledon finalist Ilie Nastase will not be invited to the Royal Box on Centre Court.
The 70-year-old Romanian has been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation following his comments about the skin color of the baby Serena Williams is expecting, and his foul-mouthed outbursts during a recent Fed Cup match between Romania and Britain.
"What he did, we have to say, his actions were not very good and we condemn them," Brook said.
Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Williams' unborn baby when he said: "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?"
The two-time Grand Slam winner also asked British captain Anne Keothavong for her hotel room number and verbally abused umpire Jaume Campistol and referee Andreas Egli before swearing at Keothavong and British player Johanna Konta as he was banished from the court.
Nastase was escorted out by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie.
A national icon in Romania, Nastase defied the ban by briefly returning the following day. He pointedly refused to apologize in the immediate aftermath of the controversy, saying he had no regrets.
Nastase, who twice finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in the 1970s, is awaiting sanction by the International Tennis Federation after being hit with a provisional suspension.

CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."

The lottery will guarantee "transparent and fair distribution" of units, and is part of the city's measures to curb speculation in the housing market.
Shanghai's housing regulator also said real estate developers, agents and sales companies are forbidden from getting involved in speculative home sales.
The authorities concerned will blacklist firms and individuals that violate the rules.
Property firms and agents need to carry out only genuine, verifiable deals and prevent transactions involving fictitious names aimed at circumventing purchase limits, said the circular, which was issued late on Thursday.
Analysts said the lottery system will benefit buyers of smaller, lower-priced properties that are in limited supply and hence in high demand.
The lottery system also requires that transactions be notarized to ensure fair and transparent distribution of market-oriented housing projects.
The lottery system has been widely applied already in the distribution of subsidized government housing for lower-income families and low-rent houses.
"When supply (of new homes) doesn't meet demand, a notarized lottery system will work better than any other system. Unnotarized lottery systems used to lead to underhand dealings in the past, and scalpers would enter the market to resell home purchase qualifications. Now, the new system will maximize protection for homebuyers," said Yan Yuejin, a senior researcher with the E-house China R&D Institute.
Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with Centaline Property, said the lottery system supplements existing home purchase restrictions in Shanghai. It is likely to be adopted by other cities facing similar demand-supply mismatches.
Shanghai's new homes inventory by April-end stood at 6.28 million square meters, which would be absorbed by the market in nine months, if there are no more supplies, E-house data showed.
In Shanghai, stricter limits have been imposed on homebuyers' qualifications and down payment requirements to stabilize prices.

PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Saturday that the latest US-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint military drills were "unprecedentedly hideous and most adventurous ones" in several decades.
In a military commentary, the official Korean Central News Agency said the US and ROK have made it public that all their joint military drills aimed to "remove the leadership" of the DPRK and "bring down its system."
These exercises had "thrown away their deceptive veils as annual drills and defensive ones," it said.
"The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills revealed that the new Trump administration, too, is resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK by use of force, tougher sanctions and pressure," it said.
The US and ROK have just concluded two-month-long joint military drills involving 300,000 troops.
The US has also sent its aircraft carrier task group USS Carl Vinson and a nuclear submarine to waters off the Korean peninsula, besides carrying out nuclear bomb dropping drills in ROK and test launching two intercontinental ballistic missile within one week from California to the Western Pacific over the past two weeks.

The 4th Xinghao Youth Script and Creative Designing Competition and Award Ceremony was held at the Beiguo Theater of Beijing Normal University on May 4 as a part of the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival.
"A successful film may involve many factors such as a good director, popular performers or brilliant visual effects, but a failed one must have a close relationship with the quality of a certain script," Wang Hailin, renowned Chinese playwright, said at the competition.
"College students represent the most vigorous and passionate group in the entire society. When you devote yourselves to writing scripts, you may be faced with many temptations like money, power, glory or status, but you should not forget your original will, and stick to your dream," he added.
Since its call for scripts one month ago, a total of 540 creative scripts from various fields were sent by students from many top universities, including Beijing Film Academy, The Central Academy of Drama, Shanghai Theatre Academy, Communication University of China, Peking University, Fudan University.
Eighteen candidates’ scripts were selected for the final competition. There were three second prize winners, five third prize winners and 10 consolation prizes awarded.

Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]
With the United States having withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, trade officials from the remaining members gathered in Canada on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking ways to keep it alive. But can they really make any breakthrough?
The US accounted for about 24 percent of the world's total GDP last year according to the World Bank. Thus, a TPP without the US is simply not feasible. With the US having a central role, the economies of the member countries were complementary to it. After the US' withdrawal from the deal, the total share of the remaining TPP members has decreased to 13 percent of the world's total GDP and the competition among them has increased while the complementary nature of their economies has decreased.
For instance, Japan and Australia both want to export their agriculture products. Australia and Canada both want to increase their exports of minerals. Thus, the real economic value of any TPP without the US is limited. Considering the business community is more sensitive to the economic benefits than its political purposes, the strategic advantages calculated by politicians may not be enough to win the support of the business communities in the various countries.
If a deal was ratified without the US, it would send a very strong signal that the US has lost direct control of it. Then US President Donald Trump's decision to quit would be harshly criticized as a policy mistake, the US' credibility would be doubted by its allies, and, should the US want to join someday, it would have lost the initial advantages it had.
For the Barack Obama administration, the TPP had dual values. One was its economic value, the other its strategic value.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated in January 2016 that the TPP would increase annual real incomes in the US by $131 billion, 0.5 percent of its GDP, by 2030, and its annual exports by $357 billion, 9.1 percent of its GDP, by the same year.
But on Jan 23, Trump, the newly installed US president, signed an executive order to quit the TPP.
He had a number of justifications for this.
First, although joining the TPP would have been lucrative for the US as a whole, many of his supporters, especially blue-collar workers disliked the TPP and claimed it would hurt them. Fulfilling his campaign promise to these voters was necessary to legitimize Trump's presidency.
Second, Trump's withdrawal from the TPP doesn't mean it has died. The agreement is still there and can be resurrected if desired.
Third, Trump was not satisfied with some of the clauses in the TPP. He wants to use withdrawal from the deal as a way to shift from the multilateral mechanism to bilateral mechanisms, and then use the efficiency of bilateral negotiations to "fix" the clauses in the TPP he is not happy with, and push the US' allies to take more responsibility.
Fourth, even though the TPP would still have a strategic function, without the US as a member its hedging function has been weakened dramatically, since most of the remaining members have strong economic and trade relations with China.
Trump has thus concluded that is it not a good deal for the US to sacrifice its market opportunities for such a limited strategic purpose. For Trump, an ungratified and stagnating TPP that can be resurrected when needed is in the best interests of the US.

Long seen as an anti-ageing treatment for women, more and more men are giving Botox – err, Brotox – a shot. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Enter Botox, a lethal neurotoxin (technically "botulinum toxin type A") that relaxes muscles via injection and was discovered to help reduce wrinkles by a California plastic surgeon in 1989. After a long period of formal trials, it was approved for use in the US in 2002 – and has since become a household name as the world's most common cosmetic procedure.
Long used by women, in the early Botox days, there were few male clients; most did it for occupational reasons, such as actors and anchormen. Through wider acceptance in society, it has become more common for men in recent years. Some clinics in Hong Kong even claim that male clients compose 50% of their business today. The rise in popularity explains how the humorous nickname "Brotox" has entered the vernacular.
Where do guys get their Brotox injected? They say the eyes are the key to the soul – and so the most popular areas address crow's feet and the vertical lines between the eyebrows. These lines can make a man look angry and unapproachable, which is why nine-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz, an open endorser of Botox, wanted to try it in the first place. In an interview with plastic surgery website Make Me Heal, Spitz explained, "I wasn't trying to look younger or different; I just wanted my face to portray how good I was feeling inside – instead of telling the world that I was perplexed or angry all the time."
Concerned about "surprise lines" on your forehead? Those annoying, intractable lines can also make you look older than you actually are, so a considerable amount of Botox treatments are focused on this area. However, it's hard to completely remove them because this is an easy-to-crease area.
Botox has been nicknamed the "lunchtime facelift" because it can be done in less than 15 minutes. Expect to see effects after two weeks of injection, with the best results after about a month. In Hong Kong, the standard practice is to have a consultation session with your doctor before deciding what areas to address and how many shots are needed. Fees are charged per area or per unit, depending on the clinic; locally, some start at HK$3,000 per treatment package of 10 units. You don't need to drastically change your routine or eating habits. Just avoid alcohol on the first day of injection and don't apply pressure to the area. So, what are your plans for lunch?

CAI MENG/CHINA DAILY
Launched by President Xi Jinping in September 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is designed to improve global connectivity and physical infrastructure to better link China with the rest of Asia, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The initiative envisages the creation of multiple economic corridors under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.




In the past four years, the Belt and Road Initiative has gradually gained traction with new projects and financing coming on stream, such as the flagship 418-kilometer rail link with Laos and the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. While it's hard to quantify the total number of projects and amount of financing, the China Development Bank said it alone had reserved $890 billion for more than 900 projects in 2015, highlighting the magnitude of the undertaking.
Indeed, while new multilateral institutions such as the AIIB have started to play an active role in project financing, most of the funding for the initiative's projects is actually bilateral. In addition to that from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, we estimate that the "big-four" State-owned banks extended $90 billion loans to the economies along the initiative's two routes in 2016. Thus, bilateral financing from China's commercial and policy banks dwarfs multilateral financing and we expect that to remain the case in the future.
Nevertheless, even the combined annual bilateral and multilateral financing flows, including those from international multilateral institutions (such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) are modest compared to infrastructure spending and needs in the vast region covered by the initiative (the Asian Development Bank estimates the annual infrastructure investment needs at $1.7 trillion until 2030).
That said, the initiative-generated infrastructure will benefit some of the least developed parts of the world, and improved infrastructure should facilitate trade and investment, create new market demand and contribute to global development. While we estimate the region covered by the initiative will contribute 80 percent of global GDP growth by 2050, up from 68 percent in 2016, our fairly constructive projection of growth in the region is subject to downside risks, including those from global trade protectionism and, domestically, from supply side constraints, which, however, can be reduced by infrastructure development, and regional trade and investment collaboration.
Of course, China needs to make sure its engagement with other countries does not become unbalanced. Especially, it needs to ensure its manufacturing exports to the economies along the two routes do not crowd out domestic production and result in trade deficits that could lead to economic and/or political tensions. In fact, while the share of China's exports to the region covered by the initiative has grown steadily, from 23 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2016, the share of China's imports from the economies along the two routes has fallen in recent years (measured in US dollars)－partly because of the drop in commodity prices, though.
We expect Chinese construction companies to largely benefit from the initiative through new sources of demand abroad, but we don't expect it to have a major impact on mopping up excess capacity in China's heavy industry, because the annual demand for heavy industrial products in the initiative-generated projects will be small compared to the scale of overcapacity in China's heavy industries.
In conclusion, China has devoted significant amounts of political capital, energy and financial resources to the initiative, and it has made some notable progress over the past four years. And although the initiative's short-term macro impact is likely to be modest, if well managed, we expect it to support long-term growth and development in the economies involved. The initiative can also increase China's international influence by providing a platform for it to enhance its role in global financial governance, and eventually help the internationalization of the yuan by encouraging its use in both trade and financial transactions, albeit under the condition that China liberalizes its capital account.

BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.

A potential homebuyer checks out a property project in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Dec 17, 2016. [Asianewsphoto by Long Wei]
BEIJING HAS INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES to cool its real estate market. At least eight banks have raised their mortgage interest rates, and five no longer accept personal applications for loans if their pledges are commercial real estate. The Mirror, a Beijing-based newspaper, comments:




These cooling measures come at the right time. As property prices in the capital have continuously risen, hot money rushed into the realty market. If that trend continues, the ever-growing bubble in the housing market would pose a challenge to the national economy.
The falling number of secondhand house deals best shows that the measures are quite effective. According to realty agencies, the number of secondhand house deals registered via online platforms in April was 16,902, 35 percent lower than the figure in March and 36 percent lower year-on-year.
But while applauding the firm actions taken by the authorities to curb speculation, we also hope they can take into consideration the needs of those who sell smaller apartments to buy a bigger one to meet their needs.
According to the current regulations, these people need to pay higher down payments as well as higher interest rates for their housing loans, even the tax and administrative fees for their deals are higher.
Some people want to buy a bigger apartment because they have growing families. Such buyers are not speculators. It is time to distinguish them from speculators and consider giving them tax incentives and other favorable policies.
On Wednesday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, announced its 2017 legislative work plan, according to which a property tax will be considered. By taxing those who own two or more houses, a property tax would be an effective way to curb speculation.
That move is also long-term because it will be part of the law. We look forward to the introduction of a property tax as it will help root out speculation from the realty market.

Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."

CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."

Two Chinese geological parks were approved on Friday to enter the Global Geoparks Network established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The two parks, Arxan National Geopark and Koktokay National Geopark, are located respectively in northwest China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Arxan National Geopark in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region is characterized by its landscape of volcanoes and hot springs and a large variety of lava formations, such as rocks and volcanic crater lakes.
Koktokay National Geopark is located in the Altay Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It has a large area of mining pits, with deposits of over 80 kinds of minerals. The park is also well-known for the granite landscapes and an earthquake fault zone.
A total of eight geoparks were approved to enter the network on Friday, with the others scattered in Spain, France, Iran, Mexico and South Korea. The new approval raises the total number in the list to 127.

LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers lays up a shot against the Toronto Raptors' Kyle Lowry in Game 2 of their NBA Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday in Cleveland. James scored 39 points to help the Cavs to a 125-103 victory and a 2-0 series lead. Tony Dejak / Ap
James passes Abdul-Jabbar mark as Cavs crush Raptors 
CLEVELAND - Unstoppable. Untouchable. Undefeated. 
Back on the playoff stage, where he's starred so many times before, LeBron James is making things look easy. 
James scored 39 points, passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time career playoff scoring list and pushed the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 125-103 blowout over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday night. 
Just like a year ago in the conference final, the Cavs are up 2-0 on the Raptors, who had better figure some things out or this series will be over quickly. 
Toronto was blown out for the fifth straight time in Cleveland in the playoffs, losing each by an average of 24.2 points. 
Game 3 is on Friday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre. 
James, who has won a road game in 27 consecutive series, appears determined to toss Toronto aside. He finished 10 of 14 from the field, dropped four 3-pointers and 15 free throws. 
"He did miss six free throws," cracked Toronto's Kyle Lowry. "He's playing unbelievable. He's playing like LeBron James." 
In Cleveland's past nine playoff wins, James is averaging 34.9 points, 10 rebounds and 8.1 assists. 
Kyrie Irving had 22 points and 11 assists and Channing Frye scored 18 points for the reigning champions, who are 6-0 so far defending their title. Cleveland is 9-0 since losing Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals. 
The Raptors didn't start Jonas Valanciunas, but he led them with 23 points. Toronto only got five points from All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who didn't make his first field goal until the first minute of the fourth quarter. 
Of bigger concern might be the status of Lowry, who sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. He scored 20 points but spent the fourth quarter in the locker room icing his ankle. 
"It's pretty sore," Lowry said after limping to the postgame podium. "I'm going to get treatment and get ready for Game 3." 
James came in needing 25 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, and he overtook the Hall of Fame center with a 3-pointer in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped the Cavs open a 26-point lead. 
James (5,777 points) now only trails Michael Jordan (5,987), the player to whom he has been compared since he was a teenager, for the most points in postseason history. 
James is also trying to match Jordan's six titles. He's halfway there, and the way the Cavs are playing, he could have No 4 before long. 
Raptors coach Dwane Casey promised the Raptors "would be a different team tonight coming out". 
He started a smaller lineup, benching the 7-foot Valanciunas and forward DeMarre Carroll in favor of guard Norman Powell and forward Patrick Patterson. 
Casey also moved Serge Ibaka from power forward to center. 
The moves were intended to give Toronto more ball handlers and open the floor on offense. 
They didn't work, simply because the Raptors couldn't contain James. 
Casey, though, is confident his team can go home and even the series. 
"I believe in our players," he said. "I believe in our guys. I know there is another level we can get to. I've seen it before." 
It won't matter if James raises his, too. 
Milestone 
James also became the fourth player with 300 career 3-pointers in the postseason, joining Ray Allen (385), Reg-gie Miller (320) and Manu Ginobili (312). 
On his 40th birthday, coach Tyronn Lue said the best gift would be a win. But the former NBA journeyman, who won two titles and played for seven teams, reflected on the milestone. 
"A little kid from Mexico (Missouri) with just dreams and hopes," he said. 
"You never thought it would come true, but I worked hard and I'm here and I'm just blessed."

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd said that the C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, is set to become the new star of its 600-plus aircraft fleet, stating that its "safety and state-of-the-art design will bring superb a flying experience to its passengers".
In a written reply to China Daily, the Shanghai-based airline, which is expected to be the first carrier to take delivery of the homegrown single-aisle passenger jet, said it was "extremely confident about the future of the C919".
China Eastern pre-ordered 20 C919s from the aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd in 2010, and according to the purchase agreement, negotiations for the ordering of the first five planes will be launched within a year of the C919's maiden flight.
China Eastern is one of the nation's top three airlines, serving more than 100 million passengers in flights to 177 nations and regions in 1,062 destinations every year.
ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, the subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, announced its intention to purchase 45 C919 aircraft in October 2011. ICBC Financial Leasing is looking to support COMAC with joint marketing, market surveys, signing more orders and all-around financial services in the future, said Xu Qing, deputy CEO of ICBC Leasing.
"C919 will serve the most attractive market. The aircraft will be used in the domestic market, the Asia-Pacific region and the African market in its early days. By continuously optimizing the aircraft's performance, the C919 will go global in the future," said Xu.
With regard to the two dominant commercial aircraft makers－Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE－she suggested the future C919 should pay more attention to service at the beginning to build up its brand first.
"It's important to pay attention to customer support and services, and enhance product quality and stability. Overseas marketing should be based on continuously optimized products and services, an efficient maintenance support, and efficiency of operations," said Xu.

BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia, on Wednesday.Alexander Zemlianichenko / Reuters
SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. 
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions." 
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back". 
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors. 
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being. 
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions. 
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership." 
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.

BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.

China's foreign trade is expected to sustain an upward trend in the near future, as more export-oriented companies focus on developing new levels of competitiveness, according to the spokesman of the nation's biggest trade event.
"Chinese exporters are no longer manufacturers focusing on intensive production and lower pricing to compete in the global market," said Xu Bing, spokesman of the Canton Fair.
The Canton Fair－held twice a year and known as the China Import and Export Fair－concluded on Friday in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou with reported total transactions at the spring fair increasing by 6.9 percent year-on-year to 206.357 billion yuan ($30 billion).
"Development of new competitiveness－including technology, brands, quality and services－is reasons behind the increased transactions for Chinese exporters," said Xu, also deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
There were 196,490 overseas buyers from 213 countries and regions visiting the fair, a rise of 5.87 percent year-on-year.
"We can see that more companies participating in the Canton Fair displayed products with higher quality and design, which offer high added values and are more competitive in the global market," Xu added.
The spokesman said more companies were attaching importance to innovation and building overseas branding and sales centers.
Transactions at the brand exhibition areas during the fair increased by 16.9 percent year-on-year to $10.9 billion, accounting for 36.3 percent of the total.
Su Cheng, general manager of Taizhou Chenghao Machine Mould Co Ltd, said Chinese homegrown moulds, which are of high quality with competitive prices, had also been sold to developed markets.
"The demand for Chinese moulds has been increasing recently in developed markets, which are traditionally powerhouses for high-quality industrial moulds," said Su.
According to Su, the company's moulds have been sold in major markets like the United States, Japan and Russia.
"The demand from developed markets began steadily increasing from the second half of last year. We are making efforts to developing high-quality moulds to satisfy the demand," said Su.
The Zhejiang-based company, which is mainly engaged in production and sale of moulds for industrial air conditioners, also develops garden pots which can automatically water flowers.

WITH THE PRICE OF GARLIC SPROUTS plummeting due to oversupply, some farmers in Henan province have reportedly discarded their harvest of garlic sprouts, a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Thursday:
The local governments in Henan have acted quickly to the overstock by pledging to set up a garlic association to nip oversupply in the bud. But what happened in Henan indicates once again how easy it is for farmers to fall prey to price fluctuations.
That some have urged the market to play its part at the cost of "non-market minded" farmers is hardly helpful. Farmers do not necessarily have to pay the price for being unaware of how the market works and when they should increase or reduce their production. Local agricultural officials are obliged to intervene if need be and guide farmers through these dark waters, rather than sit on the sidelines.
The roller coaster price alterations of Chinese agricultural products can be devastating to farmers, yet they are not uncontrollable.
Home to a relatively mature and stable agricultural market, the United States can offer a lesson or two on balancing supply and demand.
The food produced by one US farmer can feed about 155 people, and one-fifth of the country's food products are exported to the rest of the world. In recent decades, the US has rarely suffered from an excessive supply of soybeans, oranges, or milk thanks to its efficient supply chain, at the core of which is its agricultural cooperatives.
Cooperatives enable farmers to own and control, on a democratic basis, the procurement of supplies and services, and the selling of their products.
This should be heeded by many local governments in China, which either step back letting the market take over or improvise countermeasures such as initiating emergency buying in the face of an oversupply. Neither approach is a cure to the problems facing Chinese farmers.
The nationwide promotion of cooperatives seems to have yet to reach Henan's local governments, which only began discussing the possibility of establishing a garlic association after farmers threw their hard-earned harvest away.
Establishing online exchange platforms could also better prepare farmers for unexpected market changes.

Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]
With the United States having withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, trade officials from the remaining members gathered in Canada on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking ways to keep it alive. But can they really make any breakthrough?
The US accounted for about 24 percent of the world's total GDP last year according to the World Bank. Thus, a TPP without the US is simply not feasible. With the US having a central role, the economies of the member countries were complementary to it. After the US' withdrawal from the deal, the total share of the remaining TPP members has decreased to 13 percent of the world's total GDP and the competition among them has increased while the complementary nature of their economies has decreased.
For instance, Japan and Australia both want to export their agriculture products. Australia and Canada both want to increase their exports of minerals. Thus, the real economic value of any TPP without the US is limited. Considering the business community is more sensitive to the economic benefits than its political purposes, the strategic advantages calculated by politicians may not be enough to win the support of the business communities in the various countries.
If a deal was ratified without the US, it would send a very strong signal that the US has lost direct control of it. Then US President Donald Trump's decision to quit would be harshly criticized as a policy mistake, the US' credibility would be doubted by its allies, and, should the US want to join someday, it would have lost the initial advantages it had.
For the Barack Obama administration, the TPP had dual values. One was its economic value, the other its strategic value.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated in January 2016 that the TPP would increase annual real incomes in the US by $131 billion, 0.5 percent of its GDP, by 2030, and its annual exports by $357 billion, 9.1 percent of its GDP, by the same year.
But on Jan 23, Trump, the newly installed US president, signed an executive order to quit the TPP.
He had a number of justifications for this.
First, although joining the TPP would have been lucrative for the US as a whole, many of his supporters, especially blue-collar workers disliked the TPP and claimed it would hurt them. Fulfilling his campaign promise to these voters was necessary to legitimize Trump's presidency.
Second, Trump's withdrawal from the TPP doesn't mean it has died. The agreement is still there and can be resurrected if desired.
Third, Trump was not satisfied with some of the clauses in the TPP. He wants to use withdrawal from the deal as a way to shift from the multilateral mechanism to bilateral mechanisms, and then use the efficiency of bilateral negotiations to "fix" the clauses in the TPP he is not happy with, and push the US' allies to take more responsibility.
Fourth, even though the TPP would still have a strategic function, without the US as a member its hedging function has been weakened dramatically, since most of the remaining members have strong economic and trade relations with China.
Trump has thus concluded that is it not a good deal for the US to sacrifice its market opportunities for such a limited strategic purpose. For Trump, an ungratified and stagnating TPP that can be resurrected when needed is in the best interests of the US.

A total of up to 20 billion yuan could be paid at the provincial level as bonuses
Beijing will offer rewards to nine provinces that exceeded their capacity cut targets in 2016, financed by a portion of the 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) subsidy allotted to help address overcapacity, Xu Hongcai, assistant finance minister, said on Friday.
Rewards for good performance will facilitate overall progress in cutting overcapacity this year, but less-developed areas that face greater difficulties with economic restructuring also need more financial help, experts said.
Local governments and enterprises in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will receive money for going beyond capacity cut targets in the steel sector. Chongqing, and Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces will receive grants for cuts in the coal sector, Xu said.
"The final amount given to each province will be revealed after the central government verifies the performance of each province last year," Xu said. "We will make sure that the allocation of money is transparent."
The total amount of the rewards would amount to a maximum of 20 percent of 100 billion yuan in special funds established in 2016, Xu said. The remaining 80 percent would be allotted to all regions to help with capacity cuts, he said.
Xu did not provide details on when the amounts will be announced or how the money will be spent.
"The central government's financial support is vital in helping the province achieve the capacity cut target because relocating workers and business restructuring are very costly," said Ji Jinghang, curator of Hangzhou Low-Carbon Museum in Zhejiang province.
Zhejiang's developed and balanced economy allows its laid-off workers to find jobs more easily than those in less-developed places such as in the economically lagging northeastern region.
Zhejiang ranked 14th nationwide in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017, with an 8 percent year-on-year growth rate, while Jilin province, saddled with heavy capacity cut targets, registered 2.4 percent growth during the same quarter.
Zhejiang plans to cut 2 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2020, while the target set for the steel sector this year alone in Jilin is 800,000 tons, according to provincial government documents.
Cheng Gong, a senior China National Coal Association analyst, said economically lagging regions need more financial support from the central government than last year because local governments face higher pressure to achieve targets.

Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.

Swiss President Doris Leuthard speaks during an interview with Xinhua in Bern, Switzerland, on Jan 12, 2017. She is expected to attend the Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15. [Photo/Xinhua]
GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.

A visitor poses for a photo on the glass bridge, in August. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
Editor's note: During the just-concluded May Day holiday, "glass paths" became the new buzzword in the tourism sector. Two experts share their views with China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang on the mushrooming of glass-bottomed walkways over gorges in scenic spots across China.
Are the 'glass paths' worth the trouble?




Glass-bottomed bridges were first built between two cliffs so that people could enjoy the scenery around while being aware of the scary depth of the ravine below. For example, in Baishi Mountain Geological National Park in Baoding, North China's Hebei province, a 95-meter-long, 2-meter-wide glass-bottomed walkway was built at an average altitude of 1,900 meters to allow visitors to experience the beautiful but stomach-churning scenery below.
The problem is that glass-bottomed walkways have mushroomed across China. Search glass-bottomed walkways on domestic tourism website tuniu.com, and you will find that 24 cities have built such "glass paths" as their tourist sites. And since a majority of the "glass paths" have been built across valleys bereft of natural beauty, one cannot but question the wisdom to build them.
The rush to build "glass paths" shows the officials in the domestic tourist sites lack creativity. Instead of using the inherent advantages of the tourist sites, they are busy copying ideas and examples from others. Such homogenization fails to meet tourists' diversified demands.
More importantly, the glass needed for the glass-bottomed walkways is expensive and the total cost of such a bridge can run into several million yuan, and some tourist sites may fail to earn enough revenue to cover the expenses, let alone make profits, which would be a waste of tourism resources. And any compromise with the quality of the glass or the overall glass-bottomed bridge could spell trouble.
Liu Simin, vice-president of tourism at Beijing-based Chinese Society for Future Studies
Such bridges need total safety system
No major accidents have been reported from glass-bottomed walkways. And many tourism sites claim double-or multi-layered armored glass, which is three to four times stronger than ordinary glass, have been used to build such walkways.
But good safety records do not necessarily guarantee safety in the future. There is a national standard for the glass used in outer parts of structures (as a curtain wall for a building for example) but no special standard for the glass used in glass-bottomed walkways. I do not mean to raise unnecessary alarm, but without a national standard no one can ensure safety forever on the "glass paths".
Besides, people tend to equal the risk with glass-bottomed bridges to the cracking of glass and people falling into the ravines. But that is not the only risk.
On April 9, the overcrowding on a glass-bottomed bridge in Mulanshengtian tourism zone in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, amidst heavy rainfall caused an accident in which one person died and three were injured. The incident should be a lesson for us. Regular safety checks must be conducted to test the strength and durability of such walkways, while the maintenance and supervision staff should be fully trained to know under what conditions the walkways should be closed and how to deal with emergencies.
Besides, not everybody is fit to walk on such "glass paths", because looking down into a deep ravine might raise a person's blood pressure, increasing the risk of a heart attack. In fact, several reports have said tourists started crying out in fear on such walkways. The tourist sites with such walkways should therefore display clear safety instructions so that visitors know the risks and people with unfavorable health conditions stay away from them.
Only a comprehensive safety system can ensure tourists' safety on glass-bottomed bridges.
Gong Jian, an associate professor at Wuhan Branch of China Tourism Academy

The lottery will guarantee "transparent and fair distribution" of units, and is part of the city's measures to curb speculation in the housing market.
Shanghai's housing regulator also said real estate developers, agents and sales companies are forbidden from getting involved in speculative home sales.
The authorities concerned will blacklist firms and individuals that violate the rules.
Property firms and agents need to carry out only genuine, verifiable deals and prevent transactions involving fictitious names aimed at circumventing purchase limits, said the circular, which was issued late on Thursday.
Analysts said the lottery system will benefit buyers of smaller, lower-priced properties that are in limited supply and hence in high demand.
The lottery system also requires that transactions be notarized to ensure fair and transparent distribution of market-oriented housing projects.
The lottery system has been widely applied already in the distribution of subsidized government housing for lower-income families and low-rent houses.
"When supply (of new homes) doesn't meet demand, a notarized lottery system will work better than any other system. Unnotarized lottery systems used to lead to underhand dealings in the past, and scalpers would enter the market to resell home purchase qualifications. Now, the new system will maximize protection for homebuyers," said Yan Yuejin, a senior researcher with the E-house China R&D Institute.
Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with Centaline Property, said the lottery system supplements existing home purchase restrictions in Shanghai. It is likely to be adopted by other cities facing similar demand-supply mismatches.
Shanghai's new homes inventory by April-end stood at 6.28 million square meters, which would be absorbed by the market in nine months, if there are no more supplies, E-house data showed.
In Shanghai, stricter limits have been imposed on homebuyers' qualifications and down payment requirements to stabilize prices.

As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.

PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Saturday that the latest US-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint military drills were "unprecedentedly hideous and most adventurous ones" in several decades.
In a military commentary, the official Korean Central News Agency said the US and ROK have made it public that all their joint military drills aimed to "remove the leadership" of the DPRK and "bring down its system."
These exercises had "thrown away their deceptive veils as annual drills and defensive ones," it said.
"The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills revealed that the new Trump administration, too, is resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK by use of force, tougher sanctions and pressure," it said.
The US and ROK have just concluded two-month-long joint military drills involving 300,000 troops.
The US has also sent its aircraft carrier task group USS Carl Vinson and a nuclear submarine to waters off the Korean peninsula, besides carrying out nuclear bomb dropping drills in ROK and test launching two intercontinental ballistic missile within one week from California to the Western Pacific over the past two weeks.

Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates a point during her victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci at last week's WTA Stuttgart Grand Prix. Reuters
LONDON - Maria Sharapova might have to wait until June 20 to see if she will be welcomed back to Wimbledon this year. 
Sharapova, the 2004 champion at the All England Club, returned to the WTA Tour last week after serving a 15-month ban for doping and reached the semifinals in Stuttgart, leaving her ranked No 262. 
The Russian's return has sparked controversy on the tour, with some rivals saying she has been given preferential treatment. 
The former world No 1 is set to play two more events, in Madrid and Rome, before the deadline for direct entry to Wimbledon qualifying. 
Deep runs at those events could earn her enough points to make the main draw, while she will also find out on May 16 if she gets a wild card for the French Open. 
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said on Wednesday there will be a meeting of the tournament's sub-committee on June 20, when it will be clear which players have been accepted into the main draw. 
Wimbledon begins on July 3, its latest start since 1895. 
Andy Murray, the world's No 1 men's player, said he expects Sharapova to be granted a wild card if she needs one. 
"But I'm sure they are hoping they don't have to make the decision," Murray said at the launch of the Queen's Club tournament, a warm-up event for Wimbledon. 
"There's a good chance that she can get in by right, which I'm sure is what she's hoping for and that's what Wimbledon would be hoping for." 
Lewis said qualifying at nearby Roehampton would be a ticketed event for the first time, and that action on one of the courts will be broadcast live. 
He said this was not linked to the possible appearance of Sharapova, but because of the upsurge in interest in qualifying matches. 
Lewis also announced there will be a 12.5 percent increase in total Wimbledon prize money, to $40.8 million. 
Winners of the singles titles will each pocket $2.85 million, a 10 percent increase from 2016. 
First-round losers will receive $45,000, a 16.7 percent increase from 2016, as Wimbledon officials say they are placing more emphasis on helping lower-ranked players. 
In another development, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said two-time Wimbledon finalist Ilie Nastase will not be invited to the Royal Box on Centre Court. 
The 70-year-old Romanian has been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation following his comments about the skin color of the baby Serena Williams is expecting, and his foul-mouthed outbursts during a recent Fed Cup match between Romania and Britain. 
"What he did, we have to say, his actions were not very good and we condemn them," Brook said. 
Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Williams' unborn baby when he said: "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?" 
The two-time Grand Slam winner also asked British captain Anne Keothavong for her hotel room number and verbally abused umpire Jaume Campistol and referee Andreas Egli before swearing at Keothavong and British player Johanna Konta as he was banished from the court. 
Nastase was escorted out by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie. 
A national icon in Romania, Nastase defied the ban by briefly returning the following day. He pointedly refused to apologize in the immediate aftermath of the controversy, saying he had no regrets. 
Nastase, who twice finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in the 1970s, is awaiting sanction by the International Tennis Federation after being hit with a provisional suspension.

Students from Guangxi University of Science and Technology play with pupils in Tantou township, Liuzhou city, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in July. English, dancing, painting and calligraphy classes were held for the pupils during summer vacation. Tan Kaixing / for China Daily
The pupils are watched by tens of thousands of people nationwide. It reminds us of the movie The Truman Show, where the main character lives in an artificial mini-world where he is watched by a worldwide audience around the clock.
The difference is, at the end of the movie Truman escapes from the artificial world in which he has been living, but the pupils are still being watched by audiences nationwide even though the media has exposed the voyeurism.
Legally speaking, school authorities that install cameras in classrooms and dormitories and provide video to live broadcast websites violate pupils' rights, because they invade the children's privacy without their consent.
According to reports, some of the schools argued they obtained consent from the pupils' parents when installing the cameras. The problem is, even though the pupils are minors they have the right to their own privacy, and so the consent of their parents is not valid. More important, the schools did not tell the parents that videos would be provided to live broadcast websites to be streamed nationwide.
Some "experts" have even claimed the pupils are attending a class and classrooms are public areas, so such broadcasts are not infringing on their privacy. Such opinions are nonsense because they totally ignore the pupils' legal right to privacy and the fact that classrooms are not public spaces to which everyone has the right of access.
China has been constantly improving the rule of law and made many achievements in the past few years. But it seems, teachers and schools need reminding they must respect the legal rights of their pupils. If the pupils realize their privacy and legal rights are being violated in such a way, how can they trust the rule of law?

PARIS - Polling stations opened on France's European mainland on Sunday for a decisive round of the presidential election between centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-rightist Marine Le Pen.
More than 66,000 polling stations in the French European mainland opened at 08:00 local time (0600 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 20:00 (1800 GMT) in big cities, while the rest will close at 19:00 (1700 GMT).
Nearly 47 million voters are expected to cast their ballots.
French voters in overseas territories casted their votes on Saturday, but the results will be only known after all votes are casted on the mainland.
Official campaigning period ended Friday night, signalling the start of a blackout on any campaigning activities, according to French electoral law.
The law bans the publication of any early poll or counting results of the vote before all polling stations are closed.
Preliminary projections of the voting results are expected to be revealed by various sources after 20:00.
Macron and Le Pen topped the first round vote of the election on April 23, with 24.01 percent and 21.30 percent of votes, respectively.
Several major French opinion polls conducted after the first round have been consistent, which estimate that former economy minister Macron is likely to win the runoff after an intense campaign against Le Pen.

The 4th Xinghao Youth Script and Creative Designing Competition and Award Ceremony was held at the Beiguo Theater of Beijing Normal University on May 4 as a part of the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival.
"A successful film may involve many factors such as a good director, popular performers or brilliant visual effects, but a failed one must have a close relationship with the quality of a certain script," Wang Hailin, renowned Chinese playwright, said at the competition.
"College students represent the most vigorous and passionate group in the entire society. When you devote yourselves to writing scripts, you may be faced with many temptations like money, power, glory or status, but you should not forget your original will, and stick to your dream," he added.
Since its call for scripts one month ago, a total of 540 creative scripts from various fields were sent by students from many top universities, including Beijing Film Academy, The Central Academy of Drama, Shanghai Theatre Academy, Communication University of China, Peking University, Fudan University.
Eighteen candidates’ scripts were selected for the final competition. There were three second prize winners, five third prize winners and 10 consolation prizes awarded.

A potential homebuyer checks out a property project in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Dec 17, 2016. [Asianewsphoto by Long Wei]
BEIJING HAS INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES to cool its real estate market. At least eight banks have raised their mortgage interest rates, and five no longer accept personal applications for loans if their pledges are commercial real estate. The Mirror, a Beijing-based newspaper, comments:




These cooling measures come at the right time. As property prices in the capital have continuously risen, hot money rushed into the realty market. If that trend continues, the ever-growing bubble in the housing market would pose a challenge to the national economy.
The falling number of secondhand house deals best shows that the measures are quite effective. According to realty agencies, the number of secondhand house deals registered via online platforms in April was 16,902, 35 percent lower than the figure in March and 36 percent lower year-on-year.
But while applauding the firm actions taken by the authorities to curb speculation, we also hope they can take into consideration the needs of those who sell smaller apartments to buy a bigger one to meet their needs.
According to the current regulations, these people need to pay higher down payments as well as higher interest rates for their housing loans, even the tax and administrative fees for their deals are higher.
Some people want to buy a bigger apartment because they have growing families. Such buyers are not speculators. It is time to distinguish them from speculators and consider giving them tax incentives and other favorable policies.
On Wednesday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, announced its 2017 legislative work plan, according to which a property tax will be considered. By taxing those who own two or more houses, a property tax would be an effective way to curb speculation.
That move is also long-term because it will be part of the law. We look forward to the introduction of a property tax as it will help root out speculation from the realty market.

Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."

Long seen as an anti-ageing treatment for women, more and more men are giving Botox – err, Brotox – a shot. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Enter Botox, a lethal neurotoxin (technically "botulinum toxin type A") that relaxes muscles via injection and was discovered to help reduce wrinkles by a California plastic surgeon in 1989. After a long period of formal trials, it was approved for use in the US in 2002 – and has since become a household name as the world's most common cosmetic procedure. 
Long used by women, in the early Botox days, there were few male clients; most did it for occupational reasons, such as actors and anchormen. Through wider acceptance in society, it has become more common for men in recent years. Some clinics in Hong Kong even claim that male clients compose 50% of their business today. The rise in popularity explains how the humorous nickname "Brotox" has entered the vernacular. 
Where do guys get their Brotox injected? They say the eyes are the key to the soul – and so the most popular areas address crow's feet and the vertical lines between the eyebrows. These lines can make a man look angry and unapproachable, which is why nine-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz, an open endorser of Botox, wanted to try it in the first place. In an interview with plastic surgery website Make Me Heal, Spitz explained, "I wasn't trying to look younger or different; I just wanted my face to portray how good I was feeling inside – instead of telling the world that I was perplexed or angry all the time." 
Concerned about "surprise lines" on your forehead? Those annoying, intractable lines can also make you look older than you actually are, so a considerable amount of Botox treatments are focused on this area. However, it's hard to completely remove them because this is an easy-to-crease area. 
Botox has been nicknamed the "lunchtime facelift" because it can be done in less than 15 minutes. Expect to see effects after two weeks of injection, with the best results after about a month. In Hong Kong, the standard practice is to have a consultation session with your doctor before deciding what areas to address and how many shots are needed. Fees are charged per area or per unit, depending on the clinic; locally, some start at HK$3,000 per treatment package of 10 units. You don't need to drastically change your routine or eating habits. Just avoid alcohol on the first day of injection and don't apply pressure to the area. So, what are your plans for lunch?

Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also known as the Forbidden City, will expand the sale of online tickets on a trial basis in July. 
The trial run will last from July to October to test the feasibility of online sales of tickets for everyday, but tourists can still buy tickets at the entrances, according to the museum. 
After the trial period, the Palace Museum will decide whether to phase out the sale of paper tickets and sell all tickets via the internet. 
The all online sale may begin during the last 10 days of October. 
By the May Day holiday in 2018, the museum may offer tickets for different periods throughout a day, in a bid to avoid too many tourists at a time. 
Currently, tourists can only book tickets online in advance, but they have to buy paper tickets at the entrances if they want to visit immediately. 
The Palace Museum began selling tickets online in September 2011. Currently about 50 percent of its tickets are sold online, with up to 70 percent booked online during holidays. 
The Palace Museum started to set a daily visitor cap of 80,000 on June 13, 2015. The cap was triggered 32 times in 2015, 48 in 2016, and 10 in 2017. 
Three steps to phase out sale of paper tickets 
Phase 1: Preparation 
Date: May - June 
Starting from May, the museum will allow online selling of tickets for everyday, after an upgrade of its online ticket selling system. 
Phase 2: Trial run 
Date: July - October 
The trial will test the feasibility of online sales of tickets, but tourists can also buy tickets at the entrances. Tourists can also buy tickets by scanning a QR code at the entrances. 
Phase 3: Implementation 
Date: From last 10 days of October 
A full online sale will be carried out at a proper date, when no paper tickets will be offered at the entrances anymore.

PARIS - The French electoral commission, which supervises the country's presidential race, on Saturday warned local media not to republish data and information hacked from centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign staff.
In a statement, the commission asked media not to report the content of the leaked documents on their websites, stressing that publishing false information would be punished under criminal law.
Late on Friday, Macron's campaign team said it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
The leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, it added.
However, the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation," according to Macron's En Marche! (On the Move!) party.
The alleged hacking of the leading political party in the presidential race came on the eve of the election's run-off on Sunday.
Pollsters predict Macron to beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen with large margin.
In February, Macron's staff said their campaign had been the target of cyber attacks targeting databases and e-mail servers.

Launched by President Xi Jinping in September 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is designed to improve global connectivity and physical infrastructure to better link China with the rest of Asia, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The initiative envisages the creation of multiple economic corridors under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.




In the past four years, the Belt and Road Initiative has gradually gained traction with new projects and financing coming on stream, such as the flagship 418-kilometer rail link with Laos and the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. While it's hard to quantify the total number of projects and amount of financing, the China Development Bank said it alone had reserved $890 billion for more than 900 projects in 2015, highlighting the magnitude of the undertaking.
Indeed, while new multilateral institutions such as the AIIB have started to play an active role in project financing, most of the funding for the initiative's projects is actually bilateral. In addition to that from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, we estimate that the "big-four" State-owned banks extended $90 billion loans to the economies along the initiative's two routes in 2016. Thus, bilateral financing from China's commercial and policy banks dwarfs multilateral financing and we expect that to remain the case in the future.
Nevertheless, even the combined annual bilateral and multilateral financing flows, including those from international multilateral institutions (such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) are modest compared to infrastructure spending and needs in the vast region covered by the initiative (the Asian Development Bank estimates the annual infrastructure investment needs at $1.7 trillion until 2030).
That said, the initiative-generated infrastructure will benefit some of the least developed parts of the world, and improved infrastructure should facilitate trade and investment, create new market demand and contribute to global development. While we estimate the region covered by the initiative will contribute 80 percent of global GDP growth by 2050, up from 68 percent in 2016, our fairly constructive projection of growth in the region is subject to downside risks, including those from global trade protectionism and, domestically, from supply side constraints, which, however, can be reduced by infrastructure development, and regional trade and investment collaboration.
Of course, China needs to make sure its engagement with other countries does not become unbalanced. Especially, it needs to ensure its manufacturing exports to the economies along the two routes do not crowd out domestic production and result in trade deficits that could lead to economic and/or political tensions. In fact, while the share of China's exports to the region covered by the initiative has grown steadily, from 23 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2016, the share of China's imports from the economies along the two routes has fallen in recent years (measured in US dollars)－partly because of the drop in commodity prices, though.
We expect Chinese construction companies to largely benefit from the initiative through new sources of demand abroad, but we don't expect it to have a major impact on mopping up excess capacity in China's heavy industry, because the annual demand for heavy industrial products in the initiative-generated projects will be small compared to the scale of overcapacity in China's heavy industries.
In conclusion, China has devoted significant amounts of political capital, energy and financial resources to the initiative, and it has made some notable progress over the past four years. And although the initiative's short-term macro impact is likely to be modest, if well managed, we expect it to support long-term growth and development in the economies involved. The initiative can also increase China's international influence by providing a platform for it to enhance its role in global financial governance, and eventually help the internationalization of the yuan by encouraging its use in both trade and financial transactions, albeit under the condition that China liberalizes its capital account.

Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."

Juventus players celebrate blanking Monaco 2-0 in Wednesday's UEFA Champions League semifinal first-leg match at Stade Louis II in Monaco. Jean - Paul Pelissier / Reuters
Higuain brace has Italians eyeing Cardiff 
MONACO - Gonzalo Higuain urged his Juventus teammates to keep their feet on the ground after he scored both goals in a brilliant 2-0 win in Monaco on Wednesday that left the Italian squad on the brink of the Champions League final. 
Argentine striker Higuain was set up by Dani Alves to open the scoring in the 29th minute, then converted an Alves cross just before the hour as Juve claimed a crucial victory in the semifinal first leg at Stade Louis II. 
The Italian champion has the final in Cardiff on June 3 in its sights, with a showdown against holder Real Madrid, Higuain's former side, looking probable. 
"The dream we have been pursuing since August has been to get to Cardiff and we are just one step away," said Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season following his $98 million transfer from Napoli. 
"We have not won anything yet, so we mustn't get carried away," added Higuain, who ended a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages. 
"I stayed calm. I knew everyone had faith in me and that hard work is always rewarded in the end." 
Juventus shone in all areas against a Monaco side that has lit up Europe this season with a thrilling brand of attacking soccer. 
Buffon still strong 
But the host found Juve's defense rock solid, with Gianluigi Buffon majestic as ever in goal. 
The 39-year-old, making his 149th European appearance, denied Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao in the first half and produced a stunning fingertip stop on Valere Germain late in the second. 
Juventus, which welcomes Monaco to Turin for the second leg next Tuesday, has now gone over 10 hours without conceding in the Champions League and Buffon has blanked the opposition in five matches in the knockout rounds. 
"In every game I want to show that I deserve to play at this level despite my age," said Buffon, twice a losing finalist in the Champions League. 
"I work hard every day for this. The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it. 
"We had the right approach. They are a fearsome team and the only way to beat them was playing the way we did." 
Buffon also praised coach Massimiliano Allegri for his decision to bring Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defense, thwarting Monaco's attack and allowing Alves to wreak havoc down the right. 
"Gigi showed that he is still a great goalkeeper. He always does it in big games, and Higuain scored two lovely goals," said Allegri. 
"But to get results, everyone needs to work hard. You need to make sacrifices and track back and he did that too." 
'More clinical' 
Juventus could wrap up a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this weekend, when it faces city rival Torino, while Lazio awaits in the Italian Cup final. 
To put its performance in the principality into context, Monaco had won its previous 13 home games and scored in 41 consecutive matches at Stade Louis II since November 2015. 
"They were more clinical than us - with two or three chances they scored and we couldn't put any of ours away. Buffon made some incredible saves," said Monaco head coach Leonardo Jardim, who sorely missed injured marauding leftback Benjamin Mendy. 
Now Monaco must attempt to become just the third team ever to overturn a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League. 
"It is difficult, but we need to keep believing. The best thing is to believe it is possible, even if we only have a five percent chance," Jardim added. 
In the meantime, Monaco will switch its focus back to its attempt to win the French title. 
It plays Nancy on Saturday and needs two wins from its last four league games to become champion.

China National Chemical Corp, also known as ChemChina, said on Friday that shareholders of Syngenta AG, the Swiss agrochemical and seed producer, have accepted its $43 billion takeover bid, paving the way for completion of China's biggest international acquisition deal. 

Based on preliminary numbers, 80.7 percent of shares were tendered in favor of the acquisition, higher than the minimum acceptance rate of 67 percent needed for the deal to go through, ChemChina said in a statement 

The first payment settlement is scheduled for May 18. 

The Chinese company plans to delist Syngenta's shares in Switzerland and the United States at an appropriate time. 

"The completion of this deal will help ChemChina become one of the world's largest suppliers of pesticides and other crop-care chemicals," said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. 

However, Ding said Dow Chemical Co's merger with DuPont Co and Bayer AG's purchase of Monsanto Co, which occurred in the past two years, would continue to provide intense market competition with ChemChina, as the top six international suppliers including Syngenta and BASF SE, have all been vying for market share and financial resources to push research and development of new products. 

Zhang Xiaoping, director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said China could use Syngenta's deep experience and resources in intellectual property, risk control and environmental management to bring its products to global markets. 

"On the other hand, Syngenta will have better access than other global companies to sell its products in our domestic markets," said Xu Hongcai, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. 

"China's pesticide industry is riddled with low profitability and only global scale can improve that." 

The government pins high hopes on the reform to solve structural issues in the agricultural sector, where some agricultural products are oversupplied while others rely heavily on imports. 

China has been encouraging its companies to use both domestic and global resources to ensure the country's grain and food security in its agricultural policy. 

Niu Dun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said earlier this year that the deal would generate a positive outcome for China to upgrade its abilities in grain and food production, supply chain building and processing. 

Syngenta has 28,000 employees in more than 90 countries and regions. Its sales revenue dropped 1 percent year-on-year to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017. 

Beijing-headquartered ChemChina possesses production, research and development, and marketing systems in 150 countries and regions. Materials sciences, life sciences, high-end manufacturing and basic chemicals are its main businesses. 

It also acquired nine companies in France, the United Kingdom, Israel, Italy and Germany.

C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily]
The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry.
With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft.
Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls.
Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft.
All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials.
These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919.
Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei."
Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane.
"The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said.
"Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said.
By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast.
Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035.
After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years.
So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

Some of it is art. But fundamentally, I entertain
Mulling this over, I get the nod that Scott is ready for me. Walking into the suite, I find him rearranging the furniture. “I can’t have those soft chairs,” he explains, his accent a bit Stockton, a bit Hollywood. “They’re no good for my back.” If, as Alan Parker suggests, you are struggling to place the face, Scott has something of the Bryan Cranston about him. His hair, once rusty red, is gradually turning metallic silver, his moustache holding out longest. He’s 5ft 7in, give or take, and is dressed today in his standard film-set attire: black fleece jacket and sensible shoes.
Why, I wonder aloud, don’t we see more of Scott? He looks perplexed by the inquiry, perhaps understandably, but answers gnomically: “I do enough.”
And, in a way, I’ve got my answer as to why Scott makes his films and then keeps his head down.
The script that Scott read had an all-male crew, but there was a change of heart at 20th Century Fox and two of the characters were switched to women, including Ellen Ripley, the last surviving member of the ship. “I cast Ripley really late,” says Scott. “Two weeks out, we still hadn’t found her. Then somebody came up, I think it was Warren Beatty, and said, ‘There’s this woman, on off-Broadway, on the theatre boards called Sigourney Weaver, you should meet with her. Interesting.’ So I called her, went to New York, she walks in, she must have been 6ft 6in, with an afro, so she’s 7ft 2in. And I was like a midget, and I had dinner with her. That was it!”
Neither Scott nor Weaver, apparently, realised it, but Ripley would become an iconic heroine. “It hadn’t dawned on me,” admits Scott. “After the event, I went, ‘Oh, OK, yeah, absolutely,’ but I never thought about that.”
Being in Berlin seems to have put Scott in a reflective mood and, without much prompting, he starts to talk about his childhood. His father Francis was a colonel in the Royal Engineers and the family spent five years in West Germany after the war as part of the Marshall plan. They lived in a house so grand it had a library and Scott went to boarding school in Wilhelmshaven, where he used to watch U-boats in the North Sea: “I loved it.” Francis was offered the prestigious position of head of port authority for the Elbe, based in Hamburg, but Scott’s mother wanted to return home to be near her relatives. Scott smiles, “I remember saying, at eight-and-a-half: ‘Take the job. You’re making the wrong decision.’ But it wasn’t to be, and we went back to Stockton-on-Tees and ended up on a council estate.
“My dad was a great guy, he did the right thing for the family, but he was not a happy man for the rest of his life,” Scott goes on. “And the interesting thing is that nobody said anything. We just looked at the house, pebble dash, move in and that’s it, dude. You’d get on with it.”
Back in the north-east, Scott went to a secondary modern school. He struggled academically; only later did he think that he might be slightly dyslexic. “After being bottom for five years, I decided that I wasn’t academically sound – for anything, truly. And I was really trying. I wasn’t lazy. I just couldn’t retain anything that I wasn’t interested in. If I’m interested, I’ve got a photographic brain. I could walk out of this room and in a year, I could draw it right down to the paintings on the wall.”
Tony Scott killed himself in 2012, jumping from a suspension bridge in Los Angeles. Ridley later revealed that Tony had cancer. “Being an elder brother, if ever there was an argument about anything, I’d back off, always,” says Scott now. “Nothing’s worth losing a relationship over. So I’d always back down, say, ‘OK, then.’” He laughs affectionately, “He was like the spoiled brat really.
Family is Scott’s one great concern outside of films – his other big passion in life was tennis, which he played very competitively, always singles, well into his 70s, until he blew his knees. He is married to the Costa Rican actor Giannina Facio, his third wife, and they move between houses in Los Angeles, London and the Luberon in Provence. He has three grown-up children – Jake, Luke and Jordan – all of whom have followed him into the business, either in films or advertising. It is little surprise then that Scott has felt the loss of his brother keenly. He often called Tony the one person in Hollywood he could trust – and he still thinks of him every time he finishes a project.
“They are quite different as people, but they are both very smart. You better do your homework. Or you better have your point of view, because if you don’t, they’re going to stomp on you. When they say, ‘Why would I do that?’ you better have a bloody good answer.”
“It all comes full circle to starting out as a painter. You walk in the room in the morning, where you spent all day yesterday by yourself. You stare at the canvas and you go: ‘Bloody hell, I hate it.’ Painting is all about what you did yesterday, how you’re going to recorrect it, improve it, or go: ‘Holy shit, I got it.’” He pauses, perhaps remembering Pauline Kael and her real or imagined slights against his beard. “It’s being your own critic, that’s it. That’s the most important thing.”
Scott is well known for his time-keeping and, today, ours is up. After the current round of press requirements, he will again disappear. Back to his films, until the next time. It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy the attention, he just doesn’t need it. “Thanks,” he says, as I get up to leave, “but you know I won’t read it, don’t you?”

The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”

This system is deemed to be democratic because people elect governments and can always vote them out; it’s capitalist because corporations are constrained by the logic of competition, which prizes efficiency, innovation and infinite expansion. That logic, with its penchant for creative destruction of all things stale and permanent, can produce toxic results – which is precisely why government action is needed. Such, at any rate, is the social democratic consensus accepted by both centre-left and centre-right parties.
The questions of war and security – and the existential imperatives that they impose on the most democratic of societies – have always posed unresolved challenges to this framework, as can be glimpsed from occasional warnings about the military-industrial complex expressed by many a political insider nearing retirement. Thus, standard democratic procedures are regularly suspended as governments demand tighter control over the flow of information, classify more of their internal communications and expand surveillance without any requisite checks and balances.
The standard critique of such practices attacks the undemocratic-because-unaccountable activities of the so-called “deep state”. Rooted in campaigns to defend privacy, opponents aim to make the deep state shallower – ideally by means of legal interventions aimed at restoring transparency and accountability. The real problem, they argue, is with the malfunctioning of democracy – we could easily ignore the capitalist part of “democratic capitalism”: we just need more and better legal instruments to tame the intelligence agencies.
Governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies – they are engaging in toxic activities of their own
Alas, the world in 2017 is not so easy to pigeonhole into the neat compartments of this scheme. Consider just one example: cyber-security. Plenty of rogue states are, indeed, busy hacking the servers of their adversaries in western Europe or North America. Likewise, there’s no denying that non-state hackers, operating for commercial or patriotic motives, have damaged their targets.
They do this for motives that some might view as noble: to identify early signs of terrorist activity, to track down criminals, to disable devices that might be part of sophisticated plots to wreak havoc on our cities. Whatever the motives, we should not lose sight of the larger political effects produced by such actions.
First, the expansion (and even the maintenance) of the surveillance capabilities of democratic governments presupposes a permanent structural insecurity of our communication networks. That insecurity, in turn, gets exploited not just by democratic governments but by anyone else, including all those rogue states and non-state hackers. However, once insecurity is structural, the right response is not more security, but more insurance. This explains why cyber-insurance has become one of the most promising segments of the insurance market, with even sectors like manufacturing (itself increasingly wired up and interconnected) needing to spend more and more to insure against disruptive cyber-attacks.
In essence, cyber-insurance – like any other form of insurance – is a domain of rentiers who are keen to extract a regular premium payment from those needing their services. The truly innovative element here is that the risk that creates this new class of rentiers exists partly – and, one could even say, mostly – because of government activity.
Here, the logic of democratic capitalism is no more: governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies; rather, they engage in toxic activities of their own, which companies mitigate with activities that are either more or less toxic – depending on one’s views about the parasitic nature of economic activities pursued by rentiers. The second political effect of the ever-expanding surveillance apparatus is the disadvantage it creates for small companies and non-profits, not to mention individuals. Remember the early utopian vision of a digital world, where we would all be running our own mail servers and, with time, might even master our own version of the connected home?
Well, today we demand more autonomy at our own risk: given the sophistication of cyber-attacks – which both aim to steal data and overwhelm sites with fake traffic – it’s obvious that the only actors capable of defending ordinary users, be they individuals or corporations, are big tech firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This, too, violates the basic premise of democratic capitalism: citizens are encouraged to seek protection from companies, not governments.
When both spam and security threats are assessed using the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, one can forget about any other, smaller player being able to compete with such firms that use the structural insecurity created by governments to further consolidate their near-monopoly status.
Democratic capitalism is thus always democratic monopoly capitalism – and even more so in its digital version. The idea that the normal imperatives of capitalist competition would exert extra pressure on digital giants seems quaint. There’s no garage big enough to house a startup that can unseat Google, not with its trove of customer data and artificial intelligence.
The third effect of this new post-democratic compromise is that, in presenting cyber-insecurity as a natural rather than human-made problem, it delegitimises the role of law – and politics in general – in mitigating conflicts between citizens and corporations. Consider how we deal with other types of disasters. It would be imprudent to rely on the power of law and politics to ward off floods and earthquakes; insurance, under these conditions, is not an unreasonable option. But none of this prevents us from requiring stricter building standards so as to minimise the damage when the disaster does strike.
The world of cyber-security does not follow this logic. Imagine if the government regularly dispatched a group of well-paid and well-educated saboteurs to weaken the anti-flood or anti-earthquake defences of our houses, leaving us no option but to turn to the private sector for security, either in the form of better defences or better insurance. This is the situation we are in right now; the only difference is that cyber-security disasters are almost entirely human-made and thus avoidable.
Rhetorically, the governments might even agree that, in the face of all these dangers, we all need to strengthen our privacy laws. In reality, though, we all know that it would only result in them sending even more saboteurs – with even more powerful tools – to weaken our defences. Who, under these conditions, would retain any faith in law and politics, rather than accept protections promised by the market, however flawed and expensive?
Cyber-security, alas, is just one of the many examples where the legitimacy of democratic capitalism – as well as of the social democratic parties that have traditionally defended it – has expired, even if its talking points are still in circulation. No wonder that social democratic parties are collapsing, as elections in the Netherlands and France have shown: they claim to be defending a system that no longer walks the talk.

The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.

What is it about Italian coaches? Certainly, Serie A offers them the comprehensive grounding. Paul Pogba, the Manchester United midfielder, who spent four seasons at Juventus, described Italy’s top division as “the university of football, especially at a tactical level”. Then, there is Coverciano, the Italian Football Federation’s acclaimed technical centre and finishing school for managers.
“There is a good school in Italy but, honestly, when you arrive in England and you face this league, you must change your mind on a lot of things,” Conte says. “You must adapt very well and very quickly to this league. It is very difficult, very strong and it’s totally different to the Italian or Spanish leagues.
“In every single game, you must fight a lot. You must put all of yourself into every game and if you think you’re playing a team at a medium level you’re actually preparing for a defeat. For this reason it’s not easy [for an English team] to reach the end of a European competition. Also, for the national team, it’s very difficult to do very well in the World Cup or the Euros because you arrive at the end of the season and the players are tired.”
That is for the summer. For now, Conte is consumed by Middlesbrough and the final title push. It stands to lead him into elite company. “For sure, I looked at the past in England and I saw many Italian managers had won the title,” he says. “It’s great for our school and it’s logical to be proud, no? Last season, I supported Claudio Ranieri a lot to win the title and in Italy we celebrated this win in a great way.”

The finer details of the cash offer still needed to be ironed out and approved by the local council, Galliano wrote on his Facebook page. But if all goes ahead, from next year anyone who transfers their residence to Bormida and either rents or buys a property there will be gifted €2,000.
“We’re still working out the plan, but anyone is welcome to come and live here,” said a local councillor, who asked not to be named. “We’re a small community but very welcoming. We’re high up in a mountain area but also not far from the sea – it’s a healthy lifestyle, the air is very clean.”
But what is life like in Bormida? The manager of Oddone Giuseppe, one of the town’s four restaurants, said: “There is nothing much to do here. But life is so simple and natural, we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food. Life would definitely be free of stress.”
A report last year by Legambiente, an Italian environmental association, found that 2,500 villages across the country risked being abandoned owing to depopulation.
In January the culture ministry named 2017 the “year of the village” as part of an attempt to promote tourism in places at risk of becoming deserted.

Three Australian swimmers are facing two-year bans from all competitions for missing three drugs tests over a period of 12 months.
“Swimming Australia confirms it has recently been informed by Asada and Fina that members of the Australian Dolphins Swim team may have failed to update their whereabouts appropriately over the previous 12-month period,” the Australian team said in a statement on Sunday.
All athletes in registered drug testing pools of international federations and national anti-doping organisations are required to provide their whereabouts for one hour every day (between 5am-11pm) when they will be available for testing. Asada said that at the point of each missed test, athletes have the opportunity to put forward an explanation before a missed test declaration was made.
Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson said he would be disappointed if protocols weren’t followed by the swimmers. “Both Swimming Australia and our athletes have been very clear on our position in relation to anti-doping both here in Australia and internationally,” Anderson said in a statement. 
“The Australian Dolphins Swim Team has worked hard to develop a culture of professionalism and respect. Part of that professionalism is ensuring each athlete is accountable and responsible for accurately providing their locations so testers can access them when required. It is extremely disappointing if this has not occurred as it should.”

In June 2013, a young American postgraduate called Sophie was passing through London when she called up the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.
“That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.”
Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”
Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”
On that day in June 2013, Sophie met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she suggested he meet this firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.”
Who’s her father?
“Eric Schmidt.”
Eric Schmidt – the chairman of Google?
“Yes. And she suggested Alexander should meet this company called Palantir.”
I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of eBay and PayPal, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump.
In some ways, Eric Schmidt’s daughter showing up to make an introduction to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.
It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.
There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.
Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign.
What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.
It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”.
How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.”
AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished.
There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.
Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.”
He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said.
Who’s Chris Wylie?
“He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.”
There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.”
I did find Chris Wylie. He refused to comment.
Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”.
I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.
What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.
SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.
This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”
Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.
And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.
Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.
The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.”
Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.
But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?
“It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.”
Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.
“We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.”
A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform.
David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.”
These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”.
In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?
It makes me think again about the story involving Sophie Schmidt, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.
Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.
A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.
“On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.”
In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.
The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.
Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.
The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”.
On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook.
Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”.
And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.”
The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.
But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”.
And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer.
This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.”
Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.”
Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.
“He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.”
On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.
I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.
“I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.”
It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.
And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.
For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.
Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America.
Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.”
This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn’t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics. It’s about the first step into a brave, new, increasingly undemocratic world.

“We need to do away with this political class, which is all too often made of men over 50 who never had a proper job,” Macron has said, promising that his 577 parliamentary candidates will be half women and half political newcomers.
But if he doesn’t win a parliamentary majority, he will be plunged into horse-trading for a new type of coalition. He will need to be a very skilled politician to make it work and yet he says he hates politics and has little interest in it. “Being president of the Republic is not about loving politics, it’s about taking care of the French,” he has said, warning that previous presidents “loved politics too much” and that politics had become cut off from real people’s lives.
Becoming cut off has always been a risk for presidents who take over the gilded office at the grandiose Elysée palace, where the silence is punctuated by the sound of gold clocks chiming and the view from the leader’s desk is a vast expanse of manicured lawn behind high walls. “Of course power isolates,” Macron told an interviewer on the campaign trail, arguing that he would not let it happen to him.
--------------------------------------------------------用于测试，分隔不同的文章---------------------------------------------------------
Minutes before the legally enforced ending of the campaign, Macron’s movement issued a statement warning about a “massive hacking attack”. En Marche! explained that these documents had been hacked over a period of several weeks, that some of them were genuine and without any compromising content. Other documents in the data trove, however, appeared to have been fabricated.
Macron had already become, by far, the most targeted candidate by hackers during the campaign. In February, his movement’s computer systems were attacked by hackers based in Ukraine and needed to be shut down for several hours.
The timing is evidently aimed at bringing chaos to the last hours of the French campaign, but it is doubtful that the Macron leaks will have a real impact on the final result.
First of all, they are not a real surprise. French voters have already heard and read about the similar hacking attacks in France and other countries, notably during the US elections. And the spreading of fake news has become commonplace in France too.
Secondly, at first glance, no huge or obvious scandal seems to arise from the leak: journalists and experts will need months to properly study the content.
For months French voters have been living through a campaign full of twists and turns, violence and divisions. Families, friends and colleagues are divided and will remain so for some time
This latest attack is probably too obvious to substantially alter the result on Sunday and in fact, it might have the opposite effect from what the hackers had hoped for. This clear attempt to influence the democratic process might in fact convince some voters to turn up who had originally planned to abstain.

Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.

Cook said that there had been a “pause in purchases” due to “earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones”.
Apple reported iPhone sales of 50.8m in the first three months of 2017, down by 1% year-on-year. Its revenues grew 5% to $52.9bn, which was just below analysts’ forecasts of $53.1bn.
The company’s financial performance is heavily reliant on the iPhone. While it generated more than $33bn of sales in the quarter, a category it defines as “other products”, which includes the iPod, Apple TV and the Apple Watch, generated just $2.9bn.
While the Apple Watch may be popular with those who use it, it has certainly not created a new platform of customers for the company to meaningfully develop – not yet, anyway.
Reports in the technology industry suggest that the next iPhone will be a significant step forward. According to rumours, it could include wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. But even so, an upgrade to an existing product is unlikely to be a game-changer in the same way that the original iPhone was a decade ago, or the iPod and the iPad were.
It would be foolhardy to call this the peak for Apple, because you can never be sure what mystery products are lurking in its research and development buildings. However, it is clearly becoming more difficult for Apple, Samsung and others to expand the smartphone sector. The devices are now effectively a commodity, particularly in the western world. The market is for customers looking to upgrade every couple of years rather than those looking to buy their first handset.
But a slowdown in its biggest market makes the $250bn cash mountain that Apple is still sitting on even more intriguing.
Analysts at Citigroup, the investment bank, have drawn up a list of seven companies that Apple could buy with the cash. Their candidates are Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla, streaming service Hulu, and video game makers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive.
Some of these deals, such as Disney or the videogame makers, would basically be bolt-ons that would allow Apple to share the success these businesses already enjoy.
Buying Tesla, however, could be transformative and help Apple down the path towards transferring its technology to driverless and electric vehicles. Rumours suggest that Apple may already be working on an electric vehicle anyway.
Even if Apple does not do a deal, it seems its next move will be about bringing its technology closer to our everyday lives, whether through a car or turning its headphones into health monitors, another rumoured plan.
As smartphone sales slow, we are closer than ever to finding out what Apple’s next move will be.
It is true that the last of the five profits warnings in the past four years arrived a few weeks after the end of Pearson’s financial year, but it was a humdinger of a warning. It signalled a cut in the dividend this year, thereby removing the sole source of solace for investors during Fallon’s ill-starred reign. The share price, even after the bounce that accompanied the unveiling of yet another restructuring plan, has halved in little more than two years.
Fallon is correct that the remuneration committee sets his pay. Thus Elizabeth Corley, chair of that committee, and Sidney Taurel, group chairman, must take direct blame for a fiasco that saw almost two-thirds of voting shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Almost a third also opposed Pearson’s forward-looking pay policy. That level of opposition is extremely rare at FTSE 100 companies.
Corley also received a 27% vote against her re-election. She is the former chief executive of giant investment manager Allianz Global Investors, so this was a case of shareholding fund managers voting against one of their own. She should take the hint and go. Pearson’s commitment to “continuing dialogue with our shareholders” on pay will look thin if the same individual is sent out to bat again.
“We’re the world’s learning company,” says the corporate blurb, but Pearson has shown zero understanding of the public anger over undeserved corporate pay. The lesson isn’t hard: when you’ve reported record losses, don’t give the boss a bonus.
Oil industry hopes that the price of Brent crude would stabilise at around $60 (£46) a barrel were dashed last week.
But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week.
For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.

I have a fondness for softly spoken cheese that is just a short step from milk
Back at home, I left the burrata in a dressing of orange zest and juice, crushed coriander seeds, wine vinegar and a few flakes of dried chilli. Once the cheese had taken up a little of the flavours from the marinade, we ate it alongside a spinach and blood orange salad. One wobbly, barely set cheese and a handful of spinach each. The young leaves, their points as sharp as a spear, appeared again in a hastily put together lunch with shoots of wild garlic, the two greens forming a soft pile into which I tucked pieces of taleggio. Once heated the cheese formed pools that spilled down on to the thick hot toast beneath. I caught it just as the cheese started to liquefy, before it had a chance to colour and become chewy.
These cheeses, along with soft, mousse-like goat’s cheeses, are light enough to fold into the eggy clouds of an omelette or to spread straight on to sweet white brioche and top with early strawberries. There is something fleeting about these cheeses, with flavours that are pure and unchallenging. There is a delicate note that makes them candidates for breaking into small pieces and tossing with young peas, fresh from the pot, in lieu of butter. Or how about folding pieces of taleggio or mozzarella into warm steamed rice, so the cheese softens rather than melts, lightly coating the grains. I rather think basil is then called for or chopped leaves of tarragon.
Taleggio melts particularly easily, but you could use fontina or any soft cheese should you wish. Wild garlic leaves have a short season, so I tend to make the most of them while they are here. I have yet to have any success with planting them in the garden.
Wash the spinach thoroughly and remove the toughest of the stalks. Without shaking the leaves dry, put them into a large saucepan over a moderate heat, covered tightly with a lid.
Grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat just before it turns gold
Let them steam for a minute or two, then turn the spinach over, and continue cooking until the leaves have wilted. Drain and refresh the leaves in iced water. Squeeze the leaves in the palm of your hand to remove as much water as possible, then separate them as best you can. If the leaves are very large, chop them roughly.
Mix together the crème fraîche and mustard in a mixing bowl. Put the spinach in the bowl then fold into the mustard crème fraîche and a little salt and black pepper. Toast the pieces of sourdough until lightly crisp and golden on both sides. Remove the stalks of the garlic leaves and cut them into small dice. Keep the leaves intact. Cook the leaves and chopped stems for a minute or two in the butter, just until the leaves wilt. Remove, drain and stir in the spinach.
Get the oven grill hot. Pile the spinach and garlic mixture on to the toasted bread. Tear the taleggio into large pieces and tuck among the spinach. Grate the parmesan and scatter over the top then grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat before it turns gold.
Buffalo mozzarella is fine here, too, but use burrata if you can get hold of it, for its texture – which is softer and more fragile.
Make the marinade by grating the zest of the blood orange into a deep container large enough to take the cheeses. Halve the orange and squeeze the juice into the zest. Add the olive oil, the dried chilli flakes and the red wine vinegar. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the coriander seeds and add to the marinade with a coarse grinding of black pepper. Open the cheeses, drain them of their packing liquid then place them in the marinade. Turn them over to coat with the marinade then cover and refrigerate for at least four hours. Turn the cheese over in the marinade every 40 minutes or so.
Make the salad. Peel the oranges taking care to remove all the white pith that lies under the skin. Save as much juice as you can and pour it into a bowl. Pour the marinade from the cheese into the bowl and return the cheeses to the fridge. Trim the asparagus then cut into long thin shavings using a vegetable peeler. Push the asparagus into the marinade. Trim the spinach leaves, toss them in olive oil, a little salt and pepper and divide between two plates.
Slice the blood oranges and place them in the spinach, lift the asparagus from the marinade and pile on to the plates. Place a cheese on each plate and slit it open. Spoon the marinade over the cheese and the salad.

And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (£78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn’t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (£356m).
One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: “Why did you do it?” At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: “I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.”
Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.
He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors’s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.
Why did I do it? I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer
Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?
“There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,” he says.
Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors’s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year’s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (£10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel “sick”.
“I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,” he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.
But it didn’t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. “I didn’t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,” he says. “It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You’re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don’t get to go outside and say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’”
Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn’t really see anyone who wasn’t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn’t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.
And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company’s liking. He did as he was told.
“Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?” he writes. “Should any such line be drawn at all?” I’m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?
“I think it’s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that’s what I wish I had done much earlier,” he says. “But it’s very easy for me to say: ‘Follow your own morals and it will be fine.’ But it won’t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you’ll begin to run into trouble.” He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it’s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.
I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. “I don’t want to say,” he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned “a seven-figure sum”. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.
“You get these bonus cheques, but there’s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I’ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.” At £1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.
But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn’t perform well, and he felt short-changed.
I didn’t think about the system as a whole. You never say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’
“Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It’s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn’t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It’s more like you’ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.”
Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.
I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says – he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. “The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.”
But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He’s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? “I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,” he says, “but I don’t think so.” He says he couldn’t do it without becoming obsessed again.
Does he miss the money? “Of course, it’s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn’t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.”
A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: “Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn’t spend much time thinking about it – at least not until it was too late.”
“That was the only thing that I really liked,” he says now. “Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.”
I think he should stick to lecturing.
Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time – but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.
During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo Häyhä. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when Häyhä was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: “I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.” Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed “snipers”. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees – no matter what their job description is.
I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.
I wouldn’t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I would become
“Don’t worry,” I was told. “We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.” I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee’s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.
Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.

When the engine stops, you get off, Osama told them.
Three uncomfortable days later, they lurched to a halt on the outskirts of Jalalabad, a city in the north-east of Afghanistan, next to a dun-coloured fort surrounded by 4m-high mud walls and crowned with guard towers. The fort was a barracks for the al-Qaida training camp located at a nearby village, and Osama had grandiosely named it Najm al-Jihad, the Star of the Holy War. Surrounded by adobe huts set into a lunar landscape, it was dubbed “Star Wars” by Osama’s third son, Saad. Discarded ammunition boxes, food packaging and empty bottles of chemicals lay everywhere. Khairiah, the family matriarch, organised a clean-up.
The women pinned up woollen rugs as insulation and plumped thin foam mattresses with old clothes, inspecting the bedding for scorpions and snakes. Narrow alleys that connected the apartments to a tin toilet outhouse were swilled out, and in the rudimentary kitchen area someone fixed the water pump and got an old generator running. The women would cook on a traditional Afghan bukhar (open stove); the three nursing mothers were to have the best pickings. Osama’s 14-year-old daughter Khadija had recently given birth. Two years earlier, she had been married in a double wedding with her 12-year-old half-sister Fatima. Their husbands, two Saudi brothers in their 30s who both had wives and children already, were mujahideen fighters. Saad bin Laden’s wife, Wafa, also had a baby, as did Osama’s youngest wife, Amal.
The children fought over a battered Nintendo or scanned their father’s transistor for snatches of Madonna
Without any adult male relatives to protect them, only al-Qaida guards who could not enter the same room, the wives had been instructed by Osama to blow themselves up if the situation became critical. Even nine-year-old Ladin had a role. He was to lie on his back, staring up into the sky, scouting for enemy jets, as war with America now appeared inevitable.
At night they huddled under a blanket with a Kalashnikov and a stash of grenades, wondering what would befall those friends and family left behind in the cities, and when they would next see their husband and sons.
***
But lately there had been dissonance. Many al-Qaida members had witnessed the screaming rows Osama had with Omar, the teenage son he had been training as his heir, who bore a striking resemblance to his father. Omar had never shared his father’s obsession with war, and after he learned of his father’s coming Planes Operation, he became determined to leave. He had gone to his mother, Najwa, pleading with her to come with him. But she had never disobeyed her husband, so Omar had slipped away alone. “[My father’s] violent path had separated us for ever,” he later recalled.
But by the end of August 2001, Najwa had a change of heart. With Omar’s words playing on her mind, she asked to return to her parents in Syria – an unexpected act of rebellion from a woman who had stuck by her husband’s side for 26 years and given him 11 children.
Najwa had never intended to be a jihadi bride. Glamorous and beautiful, she was a Ghanem, from an old, cultured Syrian family, and had grown up in the cosmopolitan seaside resort of Latakia, where women wore bikinis. She had married Osama in 1974, when she had just turned 16 and he was still forging a reputation as a demon soccer player at his university, and for driving fast cars recklessly. She had been charmed by this doe-eyed boy, the 17th son of one of Saudi Arabia’s richest men, and also her cousin. Arriving as Osama’s young wife in Jeddah, she had reluctantly donned a chador and niqab, but underneath the black folds still wore lipstick and designer clothes.
Over the years, Osama’s demands had worn her down. His brothers’ wives remember her as downcast, drab and permanently pregnant. “[She] seemed almost completely invisible,” says Carmen bin Laden, the former wife of Osama’s half-brother Yeslam.
Najwa had sought help for her sons at a clinic in Jeddah, where she met Khairiah, a child psychologist, seven years older than Osama. Osama wanted to have as many children as possible “for Islam” and Najwa suggested Khairiah could help him achieve that, as well as assist with their sons’ education. Osama judged that she was perfect: the Prophet had decreed that men should wed “unmarriageable” women to enable them to share the joy of motherhood.
Khairiah eventually bore Osama a son, Hamzah, who went on to inherit his father’s religious fervour, while she forged a role as the extended family’s matriarch. It was in her room in Kandahar that everyone gathered to resolve disputes and discuss impending changes, or to lobby for an extra sack of rice, basic medicine or schoolbooks.
Unlike Najwa, Khairiah was devout, and had married Osama in 1985, when he was already well on the path to jihad. Osama’s fourth wife, Seham, was also deeply religious, claiming descent from the Prophet and holding a PhD from Medina University. She had worked as a teacher before she married Osama, in 1987, at which point she too set herself the task of having as many children as she could. Before 9/11, Seham’s hut in Kandahar had been the family classroom, complete with slates, chalk and secondhand exam papers purchased in the bazaar. The children remember how Osama would occasionally interrupt, conducting impromptu maths and English tests, with his children lined up in order of size.
Osama expected all his children to play their part in jihad. Rather than celebrating birthdays, the boys were videotaped brandishing weapons or visiting the scenes of battle. Daughters were married at the onset of puberty to mujahideen fighters twice their age, to expand al-Qaida’s sphere of influence.
Only Najwa fought to soften the children’s world and they were drawn to her, eager for the treats she procured, especially her radio on which they remember listening to American pop, and eating her improvised spaghetti bolognese – tomato puree mixed with a packet of Maggi noodles.
So it was Osama’s decision to marry a Yemeni teenager, 18-year-old Amal al-Sadeh, in June 2000, that transformed an unconventional family into a dysfunctional one. Shortly before 9/11, Amal gave birth to a daughter and Najwa walked out, taking her youngest children and one adult son whose disabilities made him dependent on her. As they drove away, headed for Syria, Najwa turned to see the rest of her family enveloped in the dust.
“My mother’s heart broke into little pieces watching the silhouettes of my little children fade into the distance,” she said later. Khairiah and Seham stayed, but froze out Amal.
Then came 9/11, trumping every other concern.
Osama departed, giving each of his sons a string of prayer beads and urging them to “stay strong and true to Islam”. He left behind suitcases containing clothes and gold coins. Dressed in tribal robes, his family would travel through the night and attempt to cross into Pakistan at a remote checkpoint, using documents provided by the Sudanese authorities during the time they lived there in the 90s. Their old Saudi passports were sealed in brown envelopes and hidden away.
***
Mahfouz debated with his colleagues for days what to do with Osama’s family. CIA agents were closing in everywhere. US helicopters flew along the Pakistan border. He needed to escort his charges to somewhere that was completely off limits to America. They were among the world’s most wanted, and relatively easy to spot: tall, fine-boned Arabs, several of whom closely resembled Osama, and who spoke no local languages.
In the end, they reached an unlikely conclusion: send the wives and children of Osama bin Laden, leader of an outlawed Sunni militia, to seek asylum in Iran, the centre of Shia power.
Among the al-Qaida families to arrive were Khairiah and a group of Osama’s children; Seham and her children had elected to stay behind in Pakistan. In Iran, they were guided by Saif al-Adel, al-Qaida’s military commander, to a remote farm east of Zabol.
The advice was of no comfort to Hamzah, who still carried the string of prayer beads his father had given him in the olive groves of Melawa, a moment so painful that he later wrote about it in a letter, saying he “remembered every smile that my father smiled at me, every word that he spoke to me and every look that he gave me.”
When Saif made it clear to the family that he was directly in touch with Osama, Hamzah wrote him a letter, later released by al-Qaida. Born into jihad, Hamzah had never known peace. Now that he was in Iran, he could see no future. “Tell me, Father, something useful about what I see,” he pleaded in 2002. “What has happened to us?”
A few weeks later, Osama, though in hiding and on the run, replied: “Suffice it to say that I am full of grief and sighs. Pardon me, my son, but I can only see a very steep path ahead.” He had a message for all the family: even though they had reached Iran, they were still not safe. “Security has gone, but danger remains.”
By 2007, Osama’s family in Iran had expanded, with the birth of several grandchildren, and they had been relocated to another building in the complex, this one called Block 300. Tensions with their hosts, terrible food and unsanitary conditions had taken their toll. Saad, 28, was by now the father of three children, a boy named Osama and two little girls. A few months earlier his wife, Wafa, had had another son who died because the Iranians had refused a hospital visit. Another shura member’s wife had also died for want of medical treatment; Khairiah suffered excruciating dental problems and walked with a cane.
Osama’s grandsons pelted guards with stones, shouting, 'We have been illegally kidnapped and hidden in this secret jail'
A temporary rapprochement was reached during Ramadan in October 2007, when the Iranians took al-Qaida out for an iftar (breaking the fast) meal at a five-star restaurant in downtown Tehran. Osama’s sons reciprocated by inviting the officials to dine with them in the compound. The following Friday, a car arrived at Block 300 to pick them up, before speeding toward Tehran University. Osama’s sons were greeted by officials who led them through the security gates and around the back of a covered prayer hall into a small waiting area carpeted with prayer mats.
***
Abu Ghaith’s mania eventually caused the Iranians to snap. But when the guards tried to manhandle him, a full-blown prison riot exploded. Egyptian and Libyan al-Qaida brothers ripped up sheets and shattered wooden beds, setting fires, hurling petrol bombs made with secretly stockpiled heating fuel and daubing anti-Shia messages on the walls. Mahfouz remembers watching as Osama’s grandsons pelted guards with stones. “We have been illegally kidnapped and concealed in this secret jail,” they shouted, thumping the wall. “Our ongoing incarceration goes against international law.” They would rather be prosecuted than remain in this “living cemetery”, they said.
Hamzah vowed to sign up for the jihad. His mother, Khairiah, declared she would return to her husband’s side. Meanwhile, Osama’s 17-year-old daughter Iman wished to go to her mother, Najwa, in Syria. However, first someone had to escape to raise the alarm. Everyone hesitated. Despite the tough talking, they had all become fearful of the outside world.
Soon after, Fatima learned that Khadija, her favourite sister, had died in Waziristan giving birth to twins. One baby was also dead; the other, a girl, was critically ill. Fatima was devastated. Deep depression settled over the family compound.
In May 2008, Iranian officials arrived on a detente mission, carrying boxes of sweets and cakes. Saad bin Laden spotted that the gate had been left open and, speaking fast in Arabic, he ordered his nephews and nieces to make a run for it. They hurtled out toward the entrance, surprising the Quds force guards, who stood down, not wanting to fire on children. Soon they were joined by their mothers, who sat down by the main gate, through which they could see members of the public strolling by.
“We want freedom, we want human rights,” Mahfouz remembers the women chanting, remaining immovable for the next 36 hours. Confronted with a top-secret cache of al-Qaida hostages crying out for help, Major General Suleimani sent in ice-creams for the children and a lavish meal for the adults, served out on the gravel. But no one budged. Exasperated, the Iranians eventually sent soldiers dressed in black overalls and ski masks to beat the families back into Block 300.
Days later, Osama’s family was given 24 hours’ notice to pack. Since the Iranians could no longer control their al-Qaida guests, the family was moving. They were driven into the country’s central desert, to the historic city of Yazd. Their new home was a sand-coloured villa surrounded by a low mud-brick wall.
The Iranian escorts took rooms closest to the main gate. There would be no trips out, they said. Such privileges had been lost. But as the family members wandered around, one thing struck them: there were no security cameras at the rear. Hamzah volunteered to hop over the back wall. Khairiah vetoed it. At 19, he was too young. Besides, his wife, Asma, had just given birth to a daughter. Saad, the eldest son present, said he would do it. His siblings shook their heads in disbelief – he would never survive. But that night, Saad slipped over the wall into the desert night. He was determined to find his father in Pakistan and then rescue them all.
After Saad’s escape was discovered, Osama’s family were transported back to Tehran, where they found a new kind of prison waiting for them at the heart of the Quds force complex. It consisted of purpose-built apartments for each family, a school, mosque, football pitch, even a swimming pool. As a joke, they referred to it as the “Tourist Complex”. But with tall walls and motion censors, it was a more modern prison and from their rooms they could hear Quds force recruits training.
At the end of the first month, some of Osama’s sons were offered their first phone calls. Whisked to the Afghan border and given a Thuraya satellite phone – a location and device that were intended to confuse American eavesdroppers – they were ordered to say nothing about their precise location. They reached Omar bin Laden, Osama’s son who had left Afghanistan before 9/11 and was now living in Qatar with his British wife Zaina. Over the years, Omar and his mother, Najwa, had written to the International Red Cross and the United Nations in search of their family. Now, stunned, they got a call from the desert. Omar promised to help.
The phone party returned to Tehran, their spirits buoyed. But then came news from Pakistan. Saad bin Laden was dead – killed in a drone strike in Waziristan. That night, Osama’s grieving sons gathered. They had convinced each other that Saad had been reunited with their father, and now they felt hopeless.
***
On 21 November 2009, Mahfouz was deep into his late night Qur’anic reading when he heard a knock at the door. He opened it to find Iman, Osama’s daughter, now 18, requesting to see his daughter Khadija, her best friend. When they were alone, Iman took off a gold ring and handed it to her. “This was a gift from my father but now it’s yours,” Iman said, explaining that something was about to happen that would “hit the compound like an earthquake”.
Slipping off her niqab, Iman swaddled a doll as if it were a baby, and made her escape
While Khairiah and Fatima bin Laden filled their trolleys, with excited young children trailing behind, demanding sweets, Iman pulled Khadija into the toy section. Weren’t they too old for this, Khadija asked? Iman grabbed a lifesize baby doll and took out some clothes she had snatched off a shelf elsewhere in the store. Khadija watched, stunned, as her friend changed into them, slipping off her black abaya and niqab, and transforming herself with an Iranian chemise, a pair of jeans and a colourful headscarf wrapped around her hair in the Iranian style. Then she swaddled the doll in a blanket as if it were a real baby, embraced her friend and set off. “What are you doing?” Khadija hissed. “What does it look like?” Iman called back, before vanishing into the crowd.
It took a few minutes for their Iranian escorts to realise she was missing, and then intelligence agents swarmed into the square. But Iman was too quick for them and had asked the first woman she saw with a phone if she could borrow it. She rang her oldest brother, Abdullah bin Laden, a Jeddah businessman who had rejected his father’s lifestyle back in 1995. Unable to believe he was talking to someone he had thought was long dead, he instructed Iman to run to the Saudi embassy. He would call ahead.
Back in the Tourist Complex, the family sat in silence, too frightened to be hopeful. For three days there was no news. Then, as Mahfouz and his family watched a local cable channel, a ticker tape ran across the bottom of the screen. Normally, it carried service updates or ads for local kebab shops. But this one was different. “Iman is fine,” it read. “She has come.”
Iman bin Laden was reunited with her mother Najwa in Syria in early 2010, after spending more than 100 days inside the Saudi embassy in Tehran. She now lives in Jeddah with several siblings, including Fatima; her mother often travels to Qatar where many other family members live, including Omar and Ladin.
After a year in Pakistani detention, Khairiah, Seham and Amal, who had all witnessed the killing of their husband, were deported, along with 11 children and grandchildren, to Saudi Arabia. Today they live in a compound outside Jeddah.
Mahfouz, who watched the news reports on Osama’s death from the Tourist Complex, finally escaped Iran in 2012 and returned to Mauritania.

Mrs May is not the most awesome political genius to walk the earth. Far from it. She has little in the way of solid achievement to show for her nine months at Number 10 and has spent her election campaign swaddled in opacity about what she would do with a five-year term. Mrs May only gets to look unbeatable because of the paucity of the competition provided by a Labour leadership that combines unelectable hard leftism with utter ineptness.
It was not “inevitable” that we would have this “Brexit election” at all. This is happening because of the narrow victory for Out in the referendum last year. Only a small amount of mental energy is required to envisage an alternative history that would have produced a different result. A Labour party under more credible leadership that had demonstrated some enthusiasm for the Remain cause could very well have tipped the result the other way when the country made its choice about Europe.
As Labour stares into the jaws of disaster, it is essential to grasp that there was nothing pre-ordained about this rout. The electoral evisceration of Labour wasn’t written in the stars. Defeat is not to be blamed on the whims of the gods or the tides of the moon. This calamity can’t be put down to the caprice of fate. The Tories were handed this opportunity to smash their way to a big majority because Labour made terrible choices and is under abysmal leadership.
A thumping Tory triumph now looks unstoppable. It was never inevitable.

The boy had made the original call, police said in a statement.
According to the statement, two officers responded to a 911 call requesting a welfare check on a 15-year-old standing in front of a school. The caller said the boy was not armed.
A boy at the school pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at one of the responding officers as they exited their patrol cars, the statement said.
The officers drew weapons and instructed the boy to drop the gun, the statement said, but he refused and walked toward an officer, ignoring a second command to drop the gun and continuing to walk toward one of them.
Both officers fired, striking the boy several times. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.
The gun held by the teen turned out to be a semi-automatic BB air pistol, police said.
The boy, who was not identified because of his age, was a local resident who was a student at the school where he was shot, police said.

International support for landmine clearance has fallen below $400m for the first time in a decade
The effects of war are felt in the devastation of services; the destruction of economies; the fragmentation of families and communities; long-term injuries and illnesses; and, of course, the absence of loved ones. But you cannot restore water supplies or reopen schools or plant crops if you cannot cross the land safely. You cannot recover psychologically while living in constant fear of setting foot in the wrong place. The converse of that depressing truth is that investing in munitions destruction and clearance pays dividends. It is the first step to solving many more problems.

“The prime minister warmly congratulates president-elect Macron on his election success,” the statement said. “France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities.”
While Marine Le Pen was projected to take about 11m votes, double her father’s score in 2002, it was clearly satisfying to many leaders that the far right appeared unable to get above the 40% mark, which some feared would be breached.
“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité! France chose that today. The great nation was, is, and remains in the middle and at the heart of Europe,” wrote Gabriel on Twitter, using France’s national slogan.
Not only did the result come as a significant relief for the European commission, but it will be seen by some in Brussels as a vindication of the EU executive’s unprecedented backing for a candidate in a domestic election. The decision to not comment during the Brexit referendum in the UK, and the question of whether that had been the right way forward, had weighed heavily on officials’ minds in Brussels.
Responding to Sunday’s result, Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party, the largest group in the European parliament, of which Merkel and Juncker are members, expressed the relief felt by many at the result and its wider ramifications. “The election shows that people are ready to fight against extremism and populism,” he said. “For all those who think that France can only be strong in a strong Europe and that Europe needs France to be self-confident and sure of its assets, this result is an immense relief.”
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, and now the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “Congratulations to President @EmmanuelMacron! Everyone is looking to #France now to take the lead in a New Deal for Europe.”
Macron is said to be planning to promote democratic conventions in every member state in order to gauge the type of EU citizens are seeking.
He also made public his desire for the 73 seats currently held by UK MEPs to be transferred to a trans-national European list in a symbolic show of support for further pan-European cooperation.
Indeed while Downing Street welcomed the result, the British government may reasonably harbour some concerns about what the result will mean for the Brexit negotiations.

But Berisha’s brilliance – and James Troisi’s extra-time volley that struck a post – could not prevent Sydney’s third A-League title, secured in a mostly jubilant, but uniformly breathless, arena that had witnessed fireworks – both metaphorical and literal – from start to finish. It also went some way to eliminate painful memories of the last time these two sides met in a grand final, two years ago in Melbourne, although Graham Arnold would rather have won in different circumstances.
“I’ve been through that [a grand final penalty shootout] before,” the Sydney coach said. “It’s not the greatest way to win or lose. But that’s the way it is. I thought it was a real cup final. It was a very physical game, a lot of free-kicks, a lot of fouls, a lot of passion.”
Indeed, it was far from a classic encounter between these two old rivals but what it lacked in class and guile was made up for in brawn and, by the end of the night, pure drama. From the first whistle, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque set the tone, leaving a high foot in on eventual Joe Marston medal recipient Daniel Georgievski’s thigh and what ensued during a niggly, and at times spiteful, game should have come as no surprise.
Referee Jarred Gillett had his work cut out – nearly every decision he made was vociferously contested by one side or the other, and the opening period ended with five names in his notebook. He had accrued a total of 11 by the time the shootout arrived. Meanwhile, Graham Arnold and Kevin Muscat spent much of their time stalking the touchline and berating the fourth official.
The flow of the game suffered from the regular stoppages, playacting and constant recriminations – and arguably the state of the pitch, which had been used for a Super Rugby fixture the previous night despite a last-ditch attempt to shift that fixture elsewhere. With both team’s more creative players stifled, the likes of Ninković and Rojas were unable to stamp their authority in the way they might have been expected.
With supply lines cut, scoring opportunities were few and far between. Fahid Ben Khalfallah found Rojas at the back post with pinpoint accuracy after 11 minutes, but the New Zealand international’s pull back across the face of goal was turned over the bar by a Sydney defender.
Ninković was able, fleetingly, to give a glimpse of what he is capable of when he delivered a teasing ball across the face of goal on 16 minutes, the kind that must have been in mind when the term “corridor of uncertainty” was invented. Victory survived, but it led to a brief period when Sydney began to flex their muscles for the first time.
Berisha soon put paid to that with his individual moment of brilliance. The Kosovo international took on the Sydney defence with the kind of single-minded intent that has become his trademark. The way he scythed through Sydney’s backline showed scant regard for a defence that had, to that point, conceded just 12 goals all season. He has now scored in each of the four grand finals he has appeared in.
The initial spate of bookings came soon after the deadlock had been broken and it took just over 20 minutes for Khalfallah and James Troisi to been shown yellow, along with Sydney’s Josh Brillante, Ninković and Filip Hološko. Three of those names were taken following an ugly 20-man coming together in the centre circle as tempers boiled over in a moment that typified the first half.
Any hopes that cooler heads would emerge after the break soon evaporated as Victory skipper Carl Valeri levelled the booking ledger by becoming Victory’s third man into the book, for a crude challenge that might have warranted a straight red on another day.
Football was, however, occasionally allowed to shine through amid the pervading fug. Most of it came from Sydney in the second half and it was the home side who fashioned the better chances – first Hološko ballooned over from close range when he should really have done better, and then David Carney, on for Hološko, saw an effort saved by Thomas.
Carney, who won the title 11 years ago during his first stint with Sydney, was to play a key role moments later. It was his curling shot that Lawrence Thomas tipped onto the inside of the post, leaving a desperate, prone Berisha to head feebly into the path of the onrushing Grant. The right-back tapped gleefully home.
The goal further invigorated Sydney, yet try as they might and amid much huffing and puffing they were unable to blow down Victory’s door again in regulation time. Indeed, they could have been caught on the break, as Rojas and Troisi combined well, but the latter lacked a finishing touch.
“The first half was difficult,” Arnold said. “The first half we didn’t play our way, we ended up playing a game of kick and rush and fighting for the second ball. And when you have the quality of players like Ninković and Brosque that’s not their type of game.
“I said at half-time I’d rather lose than not play our way, the way we’ve played all season, the way we’ve created history with a lot of things. I wanted us to play our way and we did.”
To extra-time and Victory pulses again quickened, momentarily, when a high ball was launched into the box before it skewed away from a posse of players and brushed the outside of the post; the flag was up, regardless.
After the changeover, and with tired limbs in evidence all over the pitch, Troisi dug deep and mustered what so nearly could have been the defining moment of the game – a truly brilliant volley that arguably deserved to be the winner, but he saw it cannon back off Vukovic’s upright.
At the other end, Carney had a chance to settle it with five minutes remaining but he sliced his shot horribly to leave the expectant home crowd frustrated – and preparing to accept that their entire season, which had been so dominant, would not only come down to a winner-takes-all match, but rather one decisive penalty shootout. This time for Sydney, they will feel justice was served.

Fernando Gaviria claimed his first Grand Tour stage victory as what looked like being the most straightforward day of the 100th Giro d’Italia blew apart in howling winds in Sardinia.
Gaviria took the stage win and the race leader’s pink jersey after the Colombian’s QuickStep-Floors team led the decisive break when echelons split through the peloton on the final approach to Cagliari.
A bunch sprint had been expected at the end of the short, flat 148km stage from Tortoli, but the peloton was buffeted by winds reaching 40km per hour in the final 30km. As the road changed direction several times, the winds turned from crosswinds to headwinds again and again, splitting the pack apart and meaning only four riders crossed the line on the same time as Gaviria.
Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas fought gamely to join the QuickStep-led escape before dropping back, but he finished with the main contenders to sit 11th overall, 23 seconds down on Gaviria.

Unearthing an original That’s All Right record became a £4,000 lucky strike; a set of five original Sun singles at one time fetched £25,000. This made them a sort of pension for many collectors. They packed items away, hoping one day to exchange them for a caravan in the Dordogne. However, this has all begun to change.
There are about 32,000 Elvis records being sold on eBay at the moment – this number was closer to 20,000 items for all memorabilia five years ago. And it’s not even as if they are selling well. Of the 40,000 vinyl listings to finish in the past three months, only 16,000 have resulted in a sale. The problem is, there simply aren’t enough collectors left. “You’ll barely see Elvis guys here, not any more,” I’m told by Alan Simpson, an Elvis dealer at Stratford-upon-Avon record fair, as he stands over a vacant stall.

But his victory is more a cause for relief than celebration. The new president has been audacious in his centrist campaign based on a new movement, En Marche!. He has also been incredibly lucky in his rivals. Until this second round, he spoke for a quarter of his compatriots at best. At various stages, François Hollande, Manuel Valls, Nicolas Sarkozy, Alain Juppé, François Bayrou, Benoît Hamon, François Fillon, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Ms Le Pen all threatened. Yet, one by one, the contenders knocked themselves out. He has a huge task of consolidation, particularly given that more than a third of French voters supported a far-right, anti-European, anti-immigrant and racist party leader, right up to the end. There is nothing to salute there.

In a defiant speech, the far-right leader declared the Front National was now France’s main opposition movement. She urged the party to renew itself “to rise to the historic opportunity and meet the French people’s expectations. I will propose to start this deep transformation of our movement in order to make a new political force”.
What Le Pen’s promised transformation meant was not immediately clear, but that did not matter to the crowd, who cheered “Merci Marine” as she left the stage.
The Le Pen team chose a smart brasserie, which was a former hunting lodge for Napoleon III, for their party. Located in the Vincennes wood in eastern Paris, the bucolic scene is far from the grandeur of the Place de l’Opéra in central Paris where her father made fiery speeches every year on May Day.
It was a party to showcase the modern Front National, rebranded by Marine, away from Jean-Marie Le Pen’s more obvious hardline, antisemitic rhetoric. Well-heeled professionals wore discreet blue rose pins, while tables were decorated with fake blue roses. Only a few people sported the older FN flame pin.
Florian Philippot, a senior FN figure, suggested to French media that the party would soon be renamed.
Libération reported that more than half a dozen media outlets were denied entry to the FN party on the grounds of lack of space, including the investigative site Mediapart, Charlie Hebdo and Buzzfeed. But, despite the party’s claim there were not enough places, the press room was never more than half full.
There was no repeat protest on election night. Security was tight: the sprawling park was locked down for the evening, with a dozen police vans guarding the entrance.
Some FN figures have been less complimentary in private, including some sniping about her performance in a head-to-head TV debate with Macron.
“Marine did not convince the undecided,” one anonymous Front National MEP told Le Monde. Another party insider was blunter, describing her performance as a “catastrophe” that “was not worthy of a presidential debate, adding “Macron gave the impression that he had a project … Marine apart from the basics, was frankly not on top form”.
But that mood was far away on Sunday night. Dominic Leliliet, a 57-year old small businessman, said he was celebrating “the victory of the ideas”. He added: “Macron must take these into account, [the ideas of] the patriots”.

Within minutes of arriving to collect my professionally bound thesis, I found myself on the receiving end of an unsolicited and impenetrable rant about female genital mutilation.
“What’s your paper on?” the shop owner inquired.
“It’s on Muslim women and … ,” I began, but before I could finish my sentence, he had launched into the subject.
The fact that I hadn’t even mentioned the words “female genital mutilation” was irrelevant; merely saying “Muslim women” was a wide enough rabbit hole for him to dart down. My presence as a Muslim woman and my half-delivered topic were the only encouragement he needed.
It’s uncanny how often people try to demonstrate their concern about the alleged oppression of Muslim women by humiliating them. Even finding out the details of my research findings doesn’t seem to deter them from baldly sharing opinions.
I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about 'Islam’s treatment of women' countless times
When I was neck-deep in my doctoral research, I attended a black-tie journalism-industry dinner on a windy Sydney night. Some of Australia’s most intelligent and perceptive thinkers were in the well-dressed crowd. I had grown accustomed to answering questions about my subject. I had also grown quite used to the standard responses I received to my thesis, and habitually gave ambiguous answers to avoid them.
A well-known and popular journalist approached me and asked what I did for living. His reaction, despite belonging to a group of people usually known for their cognitive skills, was so representative that I scribbled it down on a dinner napkin as soon as he left so I would not forget a word:
Journalist: So what do you do?
Me: I’m completing my PhD.
Journalist: On?
Me: (purposefully vague) Sociology and politics.
Journalist: But what is your exact research question?
Me: (inward sigh at what was inevitably to follow, but valiantly indifferent exterior) I’m investigating the way Muslim women fight sexism within Muslim communities.
Journalist: (with widened, alarmed eyes) That’s dangerous waters!
Me: (through gritted teeth) Not really. It’s been going on for many hundreds of years, and I’ve been spoiled for choice with the number of women who have been willing to be participants in my research.
Journalist: Did they want it known what they were doing? Or did they need it kept secret?
Me: (icy frustration descends into Arctic winter) Oh, many of them were happy to be identified in my research. In fact, some were angry when I suggested giving them a pseudonym, insisting they wanted to be known for this work.
Journalist: (now completely flabbergasted) But … but, did their husbands know of their apostasy?!
Me: (choosing to ignore use of “apostasy” as eyes take on glacial sheen) Actually, many of the women listed their husbands, or another Muslim man – like their father or imam – as their greatest supporters.
Journalist: (now quite literally speechless) …
I’ve had similar exchanges — too many to count — with non-Muslims over the course of my research. Commonplace is the firm conviction that sexism against Muslim women is rife, most often coupled with the utter disbelief that women who challenge sexism could exist, let alone that there are many of them, that they are not a new phenomenon, and that Muslim men often support them in their efforts. I often wonder how people can be so comfortable presenting these attitudes directly to me, a clearly identifiable Muslim woman in a hijab. They do not appear at all uneasy in making it apparent just how bad they think life is for any and all Muslim women, and how unengaged they believe Muslim women to be in confronting the sexism they invariably face.
I have received similar, but different, reactions within some sections of various Muslim communities when they found out the focus of my research. Often I would be purposefully vague when discussing my topic with them, too. I would restrict myself to saying that I was researching “Muslim women”, and avoid highlighting the “fighting sexism” part, as there is a complicated, often suspicious attitude towards anything that may be perceived as “feminism” within Muslim communities. Or I would rush to reassure them that I was not framing this in an anti-religious perspective.
Their scepticism is perhaps an understandable reaction from a minority community that frequently feels under siege, particularly when it comes to women’s rights. I hoped the fact that my research was being carried out from within a common faith, and that it drew explicitly and deeply on the theological resources afforded by this, reassured them that I, unlike many others, was not engaging in an attack on the faith and communities they held dear.
But still certain people within the Muslim community were scornful, rolling their eyes and calling me a feminist — not as a compliment, but a warning. They saw feminism and Islam as inherently at odds.
This is the terrain in which my research into Muslim women occurred. The subject is fraught on multiple fronts; the topic of “Muslim women and sexism” is a minefield of unflappable certainty and indignation from all corners. Yet for something about which so many people are adamantly sure, I feel there is very little information from the women actually involved. It seems to me that, in the argument in which Muslim women are the battlefield, the war rages on and the angry accusations zing past their heads from all sides. The main casualty is, ironically, women’s self-determination.
Islam is arguably the most discussed religion in the west today, in both media and society, and, after terrorism, the plight of Muslim women is probably the most controversial topic of debate. I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about “Islam’s treatment of women” countless times in person and online. Nonetheless, there is only a small amount of published work available on the topic of Muslim women fighting sexism within Muslim communities, and much of that focuses on women who see Islam as inherently part of the problem — if not the whole problem — that Muslim women face.
The assumption is that Muslim women need to be extricated from the religion entirely before anything close to liberation or equality can be achieved.
There are limited sociological accounts of Muslim women who fight sexism from a faith-positive perspective, and only a handful of studies that investigate the theological works of some Muslim feminists. The responses to, and motivations of, these women are dealt with coincidentally, as opposed to primarily. This small pool of available resources clashes with what I know anecdotally to be happening in many Muslim communities, as well as the historical accounts of Muslim women who, from the earliest days of Islam, have been challenging the sexism they have experienced by using religious arguments.
For years now I have been speaking about issues relating to Islam, Muslims and gender to the media, both Australian and overseas. In one sense I choose this, but in another it has been chosen for me, moulded by the way others attempt to define and restrict me, more or less obliging me to respond.
It’s a common story. Jasmin Zine, a Canadian scholar, once observed that not just our actions but also our very identities are constantly being shaped by dual, competing discourses that surround us. There’s the fundamentalist, patriarchal narrative, persistently trying to confine the social and public lives of Muslim women in line with the kind of narrow, gendered parameters that are by now so familiar. But there are also some western feminist discourses that seek to define our identities in ways that are quite neocolonial: backward, oppressed, with no hope of liberation other than to emulate whatever western notions of womanhood are on offer. This wedging chimes with my experience, and it’s a problem because, as Zine argues, both arms deny Muslim women the ability — indeed the right — to define our identities for ourselves, and especially to do so within the vast possibilities of Islam.
It is as though male Muslim scholars and non-Muslim western feminists have handed down predetermined scripts for us to live by. And it is left to those people thought not to exist — Muslim women who fight sexism — to rewrite those scenarios and reclaim our identities.

Hacked campaign documents, internal emails and financial data were posted online anonymously along with papers Macron’s team said were false, just before midnight on Friday, the official end-of-electioneering deadline.
The leak cast a long shadow over the legal “election pause” during which Macron and his far-right rival Marine Le Pen are banned from making any statement until polls close at 8pm French time on Sunday. France’s electoral commission warned that publication or republication of the documents could be a criminal offence. The commission urged media and citizens “not to relay” the leaked documents “in order not to alter the sincerity of the vote”.
Just before the deadline, Macron’s En Marche! team said fake documents were mixed in with papers showing legitimate campaign activities in order to “spread doubt and disinformation”.
“This is not just a simple hacking operation but a real attempt to upset the French presidential election,” it said.
At such a late stage, the hack seems unlikely to influence the outcome of today’s election. With the final Ipsos poll showing victory for Macron with 63% of votes and Le Pen 37%, the En Marche! candidate will be hoping to put a scrappy election behind him and look forward to an in-tray which looks intimidating to say the least.
Macron, who has never held an elected post, has promised change, a new moral dawn in political life, and a bright new future. He will have to deliver quickly with, to date, no formal political party. His movement, En Marche!, has never fielded a single candidate in any election, local or national.
Macron, already accused of being Hollande II, will want to avoid that, but needs to move fast between now and the June legislative elections if he is to secure a majority of seats in the national assembly. If he cannot achieve that, there is a danger that France will be politically paralysed, making the two-round general election at least as important as the presidential vote.
Pascal Perrineau, head of the Science-Po university’s political research institute, said that, while the electorate’s reflex after a presidential vote was to give the new leader a parliamentary majority, Macron would find it a challenge to rustle one up.
“Macron has no MPs. If he wins, he will have to organise a parliamentary majority from scratch in a few weeks,” Perrineau said. “So, you are elected, but the question is, who will you work with? If you have no parliamentary majority, you cannot govern; it’s a dead election. Both Macron and Le Pen are amateurs who don’t understand the logic of parliamentary life. Alone, he is nothing. Politics is an entire career, people are not going to rally to him just because he has an extraordinary smile, young blood and blue eyes. There will have to be some serious negotiations.”
Under France’s constitution, the president is supreme political leader and can choose a prime minister, who then recommends government ministers, all of them normally from the president’s party. If Macron obtains an outright majority from a standing point of zero seats, he will be able to enact policies which are Europe-friendly and economically liberal. If he faces a hostile majority in the lower house of parliament and is forced to appoint a prime minister outside his party, he will face a period of what is known as “cohabitation”, meaning he can do little in the face of constant opposition. A third possibility is that En Marche! could have the biggest group of MPs but not a majority, leaving a Macron government with only limited room to manoeuvre but not entirely stymied.
In January, Macron announced En Marche! would field candidates in all 577 parliamentary constituencies. He wants half to come from civil society or elected local authorities. All must have a clean criminal record, renounce current political affiliations and campaign as an En Marche! candidate. At least half must be women.
Andrew Knapp, emeritus professor in European studies at the University of Reading, believes that Macron probably faces a “protracted war of manoeuvre to get legislation through, typically picking different majorities for different issues”.
According to an OpinionWay-SLPV analytics survey, Macron could gain between 249 and 286 seats, the centre- right 200 to 210, and the Front National 15 to 25. On the left, the Socialists would score the worst result in their history with between 28 and 43 seats and Mélenchon would get only six to eight, it predicts. Political experts, however, have described the poll as highly speculative, given that it is based on intentions to vote and En Marche! has only 14 declared candidates so far.
Aware that many are not voting for him but against Le Pen, a triumphant Macron will want to avoid squandering his popularity with silly mistakes or any triumphalism. After the first-round vote he dined at a chic restaurant and announced he would find a role for his wife Brigitte, both of which sparked criticism.
The success of an eventual President Macron will also depend on how many angry and disappointed FN and hard-left Mélenchon supporters take to the streets. And what he does when they do.
Sylvie Goulard, 52
From the centrist MoDem party whose leader François Bayrou was one of the first political heavyweights to rally to Emmanuel Macron, the Marseille-born Goulard is vehemently pro-Europe, a supporter of greater federalism and a graduate, like Macron, of the elite École Nationale d’Administration. Fluent German speaker. Was part of a team negotiating the reunification of Germany in the 1990s and arranged for Macron to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.
Anne-Marie Idrac, 65
Transport secretary in the 1990s, then president of the state-owned transport companies RATP (Paris region) and SNCF (railways). Also a graduate of ENA. Belongs to the Nouveau Centre party.
François Bayrou, 65
Veteran centrist and leader of MoDem, whose early support for Macron boosted the election campaign. A former history teacher, Bayrou was a candidate in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 presidential elections.

What a difference a week makes. Xhaka felt the same injury here and he was removed from the fray in the 76th minute. This time Arsenal were 2-0 up and coasting towards victory in a game they had to win.
Xhaka departed to a rousing ovation. He had made the difference, turning the afternoon in his team’s favour with a deflected pot-shot, and no one could say the break was not overdue for Xhaka, who has endured a difficult first season in England after his big-money move from Borussia Mönchengladbach, or his club.
Arsenal were up and running, their early nerves a distant memory, and when the former United striker Danny Welbeck rose to head home Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain’s cross, after Anthony Martial had been robbed by Rob Holding, the die was cast. United had offered little in an attacking sense and, when they were asked to respond, it was no surprise they could not.
At the 16th time of asking Arsène Wenger could celebrate victory in a competitive match against a José Mourinho team. Arsenal will need a favour from elsewhere if they are to finish a difficult season in a Champions League position but at least they are still fighting.
As for United, this was the limpest of defeats and Mourinho’s post-match press conference, when he wrote off his team’s top-four chances and had a pop at Wenger for pressuring the fourth official, was much more entertaining than what his players served up on the pitch.
Yes, they had two clear first-half chances, which Martial and Wayne Rooney could not take; Rooney’s opportunity was presented to him by an errant Holding back-pass rather than any creativity on United’s part. Petr Cech stood tall on both occasions. But Mourinho’s post‑match performance should not be allowed to obscure his team’s failings.
Opportunity had knocked loudly for them after Liverpool’s home draw against Southampton earlier in the day. Once again United had control of their destiny in terms of the fight for a Champions League finish via the league. They surrendered it and a single statistic continues to damn them. They have not scored a single goal away from home against a top-six club this season – and that includes the 1-0 FA Cup defeat against Chelsea.
They do retain a shot at next season’s Champions League via the Europa League, where they are 1-0 up against Celta Vigo after the first leg of the semi‑final. Win that competition, return to the Champions League and, with the EFL Cup in the bag, the season is a success. Yet it is plain Mourinho has much work to do and what was remarkable about this defeat which ended United’s 25-match unbeaten run in the league was how meek the manager was about it.
United have been described as injury-ravaged but Mourinho was without only five players because of various ailments – Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. A sixth, Marouane Fellaini, was suspended.
Mourinho’s starting lineup was strong despite the eight changes he made from the first leg in Vigo last Thursday, although he was worried about how Phil Jones and Juan Mata would cope with their first football since late March. The same went for Chris Smalling, who had returned from a similar lay-off as a late substitute against Vigo.
Mourinho, though, would labour the point about how fatigued his squad are, having played three times each week since the beginning of April and certainly there was precious little spark about them.
Arsenal pressed on to the front foot, with United happy to attempt to counter-attack, and the home team had their chances in the first half. Aaron Ramsey drew a fine save out of De Gea from Alexis Sánchez’s through-ball; Welbeck was denied by a desperate Jones block following a corner; and Oxlade-Chamberlain tested De Gea with a deflected blast.
Mourinho had clashed with Wenger midway through the first half after the Arsenal manager complained to the fourth official about a tackle from Rooney on Oxlade-Chamberlain. The home crowd stirred but they truly crackled to life on the one-two punch from Xhaka and Welbeck. Rooney had a couple of efforts towards the end but United could have played on and on and not scored.

“Rock music is a belief system, in a way, and Brian Epstein dedicated everything to the Beatles and to their success. His main concern was their well-being,” said Deller. “In terms of its characters and stories, the way we feel about rock’n’roll music since the Beatles is like religion, or at least an alternative belief system.”
“I am taking a straightforward visual approach to marking the album,” said Deller, who last summer collaborated with the National Theatre’s artistic director Rufus Norris to arrange for hundreds of volunteers to appear across the country dressed as first world war soldiers. “Epstein is someone I have been thinking about for a long time. Without his contribution and sacrifice, the Beatles would not exist as we know them and a lot that we take for granted in our culture would not exist either.”
“Epstein was the band’s friend and helped them more than a little bit,” said Deller. “He was one of a handful of people they could trust.”
The introduction to the book began: “Brian Epstein’s contribution to popular culture is so immense that it is almost too large to comprehend. This might explain why he has been largley written out of the narrative of British popular culture.”
Deller concedes that Epstein is now remembered in the name of a Liverpool theatre, but argues that the Beatles’ manager has not been recognised for the sort of “ultimate sacrifice” that was, at least metaphorically, equivalent to martyrdom.
Epstein came across the band at the Cavern Club in November 1961 and shepherded their early careers. A gay man, he was forced by the laws of the time to keep his private life secret. He was found dead in his bedroom on 27 August 1967, having overdosed on sleeping pills. Homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales a month after his death.
The surviving Beatles, McCartney and Starr, are also to release an anniversary edition package on 26 May, including a new mix of the album by Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin, and Sam Okell that will feature 34 previously unreleased recordings.

Muttonbird, sea plants and eel spines: these native New Zealand ingredients may no longer be components of many diets, but one woman and her cafe are trying to change that.
Jade Temepara, who is of Maori descent, set up Kākano just over a year ago in Christchurch. “Maori people are the unhealthiest, most unfit and most likely to have heart disease – and it’s because of our lifestyle,” says Jade. “Our cause is to bring our traditional food back, and to involve Maori people in the preparation.”
Part cafe, part social enterprise, Kākano was built with the help of the local homeless community on the site of the city’s old convention centre, which was destroyed by the 2011 earthquake. If you walked past it, you’d be forgiven for not noticing the low-rise Portakabin-style building, hidden behind rows of raised garden beds, which are planted with local herbs and vegetables. But it’s more spacious than it appears from the outside, seating 25 (there are an additional 40 seats out on the deck), and though decoration is minimal, the monochrome colour scheme, black and white photos and select few New Zealand handicrafts on display elevate the space.
The whole setup has a distinctly temporary feel, and that’s not by accident: it’s all designed to be “lift and shift”, and in June will be transported from this provisional site to a permanent location just around the corner.
Over the past year, Kākano has built up a strong following among locals, both Maori and non-, and also attracts tourists who, Jade says, “love our story”. Community classes held here – which teach adults and children how to grow and prepare their own food, from fermenting cabbage to gutting fish – always sell out.

The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.

He much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches
At 67, still a man mountain at 6ft 4in, face leathery as a saddle-bag and with his latest hairpiece perfectly in place, it seemed he much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches from toffs in bowler hats and pub brawls to cars leaping across Tower Bridge.
Colourfully and unrestrainedly, it was “fucking” and “goddamn” this, or “shit” and “asshole” that as Wayne, one of Hollywood’s most vocal right-wingers, laid into everything and everyone from “whining radicals who call themselves liberals” and “theatre actors who couldn’t polish a bit player’s shoes” to “bank presidents and stock manipulators running studios who know nothing about motion pictures”.
To make that day even more memorable, his often gleefully intemperate tirades were constantly punctuated by painful throat-clearing and phlegmy hawking which, within minutes, had swiftly evolved into an ear-splitting series of wracking coughs and sonorous spitting (into a hanky).
Yet, as Wayne – who had bravely gone public with his lung cancer, coining the term “The Big C”, just a decade earlier – battled his turbulent throat on this warm day in summer, he never showed any obvious signs of weakening or remotely giving in as I offered the occasional, feeble, “It must be very unpleasant” or “Would you like me to leave?”
Someone once wrote: “Film stars don’t die in Liverpool.” Well, they certainly aren’t meant to peg out in Perivale, west London, either.
In fact, the wheezier he became, the more he seemed to warm to his harangues, which also included “today’s filmmakers who’d let all illusion go out the window”.
When, I asked, would he finally call it a day? “I’m gonna finish,” he declared in that famous drawl, “when they say: ‘Oh, do we have to look at that old sonofabitch again?’”
He died in 1979 after completing just two more pictures.

“It was amazing how beautiful it was,” she told the Guardian on Saturday. “The silver airship against a clear blue sky. How enormous. It was the most exquisite thing I had ever seen.”
Then the zeppelin turned. Its tail swung into view. On it, stark and black, were swastikas.
Her neighbors, she said, gesticulated angrily at the sky.
Not long after, on 6 May 1937, as it was coming in to moor at the naval base at Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Hindenburg caught fire and crashed. Of the 97 people on board, 62 miraculously escaped the burning wreckage. But 22 crew members, 13 passengers and one worker on the ground were killed.
After the disaster, President Franklin Roosevelt and King George sent telegrams of condolence to Hitler.
The Hindenburg crash was the first major transport disaster captured on film, in dramatic footage ever since paired with recorded commentary by a radio reporter who reacted in horror to the shocking scene before him.
Few people directly connected to the disaster are still alive. The lone remaining survivor from the airship itself, Werner Doehner, is now an 88-year-old resident of Colorado.
“Suddenly the air was on fire,” he said this week, speaking to the Associated Press.
The Hindenburg was about 200ft off the ground when it combusted – not “exploded”, as some have since described it. It burned from tail to nose in just 34 seconds but as it collapsed to Earth, Doehner’s mother threw him and his 10-year-old brother from the craft. All three survived.
Just before the fire broke out, however, Werner’s father had gone to the family cabin.
“We didn’t see him again,” Doehner said.
His 14-year-old sister escaped the wreck but rushed back into it to look for their missing father. After emerging without him, she did not survive her burns.
Investigations, however, concluded that a spark of static electricity had most likely ignited leaking hydrogen as, in Zitarosa’s words, “they brought the ship in for landing under thunderstorm conditions”.
It is most widely believed that the leak came from one of the ship’s rear gas containers. What caused the leak is not known. Zitarosa surmised that a broken length of wiring or other piece of hardware somehow ripped the container, which was made of a tough cotton fabric with a film of early latex-type material.
Other factors may have contributed. The Hindenburg was 12 hours late to Lakehurst, having been delayed by strong headwinds across the north Atlantic before spending several hours flying around the area, waiting for storms to clear.
Zeppelins normally took two and a half days to reach the US from Germany, moving twice as fast as an ocean liner. Although the Hindenburg had taken three days, it had plenty of diesel fuel left. It could have flown further.
But passengers, among them dignitaries heading for England and the coronation of King George VI, were waiting. The airship was due to turn around in record time.
Its pilots attempted a so-called high landing, in which ropes were tossed to the ground from around 200ft, for ground crew to pull the giant craft down and secure it to a mooring mast.
Either way, it was known to be extremely dangerous to land in thundery weather. Ground crew members were soaked and there was electricity in the air.
“When the ship dropped its landing ropes, they got wet and acted as conductors,” said Zitarosa. “The ship became grounded and that’s why we think the static electricity made a spark and caught the leaking hydrogen.”
A Chicago radio reporter, Herbert Morrison, bore witness to the raging inferno.
“It burst into flames, it burst into flames!” he cried. “And it’s falling, it’s crashing …it’s crashing terrible … Oh, the humanity … oh, ladies and gentlemen …”
Zeppelins never landed at Lakehurst again. Before long, American dirigibles were taking off from there instead, searching for German submarines.

She in turn called the former economy minister an arrogant, spoilt, cold-eyed, “smirking banker” who was colluding with Islamists, complacent on terrorism and intent on “butchering France” in favour of “big economic interests”.
Both accused the other of taking French people for imbeciles. At one point, after a long attack saying Le Pen was lying to the French public, Macron snapped: “I’m sorry, Madame Le Pen; France deserves better than you.”
Snap polling by Elabe for BFM television just after Le Pen had left the TV studios, accusing Macron of “lies and aggression”, found that a clear majority felt the centrist candidate had been the most convincing. Viewing figures said 16 .5 million people watched the debate.
French media on Thursday declared Macron the winner of a “dirty debate”. Le Pen was criticised for her “permanent aggression” and even normally sympathetic publications found her “unconvincing”.
Libération accused Le Pen of “multiplying attacks and provocations … and thus avoiding any serious debate” while Ruth Elkrief, political editor for BFMTV declared it “not worthy of a presidential election campaign”.
On jobs – one of the biggest concerns in a country that has struggled with decades of mass unemployment — Macron told Le Pen: “Your strategy is simply to tell a lot of lies and just to say what isn’t going right in the country.” She said he favoured “uncontrolled globalisation” and would sell off state assets to the highest bidder.
Although Le Pen was under pressure to flesh out her policy proposals, she spent more time attacking Macron and the record of the outgoing Socialist government.
Terrorism was another key issue after a series of deadly attacks killed more than 230 people in France in just over two years. Le Pen accused Macron of an “indulgent attitude” towards Islamic fundamentalism and said he was slack on fighting extremism. He replied he would be “uncompromising” on terrorism – which he called the biggest issue of the next few years in France – and said the state had to look at the social issues behind why so many terrorists who attacked France were born and raised in France. Le Pen, who this week said “globalisation and Islamism” were the main threats to France, retorted that Macron was lax on Islamism and disregarded French secularism.
Le Pen restated her plan to ban religious symbols from all public places, which would include the Muslim headscarf. Macron warned that her proposals would divide France and lead to “a civil war” and “that’s what terrorists want”. He said: “The terrorists want there to be divisions between us” and accusing his rival of “hate-filled speech”.
On the European Union, the candidates could not have been further apart. Le Pen, who wants to hold a referendum on France leaving the EU, and Macron, who wants closer cooperation, traded more insults on the subject. Le Pen said Macron as president would allow France to be crushed by its economically powerful neighbour Germany and would “lie prostrate” before the powers of Berlin.
“France will be led by a woman, either me or Mrs Merkel,” Le Pen laughed, referring to the German chancellor. He meanwhile attacked her over her muddled stance on the euro. “The euro is the currency of bankers. It’s not the people’s currency,” Le Pen snapped back. Macron responded: “The euro is important. It’s not just a policy.”
Polls this week conducted before the TV debate showed Macron leading by 60% to 40% before the final-round vote on Sunday.
The stage-managed live TV sparring-match is a staple of French election campaigns. The format, in which the candidates face each other across a table for the cameras with no studio audience, has not changed for 40 years. But this bad-tempered exchange, which saw Macron and Le Pen repeatedly exchange insults with rather than expounding on policy, represented a political first.
After France’s two main parties, who had shared power for decades, were knocked out in the first-round vote last month amid anti-establishment anger, the two candidates who faced each other across the table were relative political novices.
The very fact that Le Pen appeared in the debate was considered a major step in normalising her party. In 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the final, the right-wing Jacques Chirac refused to debate him on TV for fear of “normalising hate and intolerance”.
Le Pen has tried to gain a grassroots presence across France and soften her party’s image, attempting to shake off the old jackbooted image of anti-semitism and racism under her Holocaust-denying father, but Macron in rallies has continually described her party as the “party of hatred”.
He said she lacked any knowledge of facts and was “feeding off” French people’s unhappiness. He said she was a “parasite” on the system that she was criticising, manipulating voters’ woes. “What class!” she interjected witheringly.
Le Pen wants a France with closed borders and to prioritise French people over foreigners for jobs, housing and benefits, to send illegal immigrants home, to turn away from the European Union and to abandon free-trade deals. She hopes to solve unemployment by blocking immigration and taxing companies who hire foreigners.
Macron wants to increase European Union cooperation and says France cannot escape the globalised world. He wants to loosen strict labour regulations and reform the eurozone with a common budget.

The interior ministry said turnout at 5pm was 65.3%, noticeably down on 71.96% at the last election in 2012 but in line with pollsters’ projections ahead of the vote. The final abstention rate is set to be 25-27%.
Seen as potentially the most important electoral contest in many years for France and the European Union, it has pitted against each other two candidates with diametrically opposing visions for the future of their country and the continent.
Macron, a 39-year-old former banker and economy minister running as an independent centrist, is economically liberal, socially progressive, globally minded and upbeat. Le Pen is a nation-first protectionist who wants to close France’s borders and possibly leave the euro and the EU.
Macron voted in the coastal town of Le Touquet in northern France alongside his wife, Brigitte, smiling and stopping to pet a black dog as he stepped out of his holiday home in the seaside resort.
For security reasons, he was driven to his nearby polling station at Le Touquet town and shook hands with a large crowd of supporters before entering the building. Le Pen her ballot in Hénin-Beaumont, a small northern town run by her Front National.
She arrived at the polling station with the town’s mayor, Steeve Briois, who took over as the far-right party’s interim leader when she stepped aside last month to concentrate on the campaign.
Feminist activists were briefly detained a couple of hours earlier on Sunday for hanging a big anti-Le Pen banner from a church in the town.
“The commission calls on everyone present on internet sites and social networks – primarily the media, but also all citizens – to show responsibility and not pass on this content so as not to distort the sincerity of the ballot,” the election commission said on Saturday.
Many television news channels opted not even to mention the hack, while Le Monde newspaper said on its website it would not publish any of the nine gigabytes of leaked data before the election – partly because there was too much, and partly because it had clearly been released with the aim of affecting the vote.
“If these documents contain revelations, Le Monde will of course publish them after having investigated them, respecting our journalistic and ethical rules, and without allowing ourselves to be exploited by the publishing calendar of anonymous actors,” the paper said.
The data was posted on a profile called EMLEAKS to Pastebin, a site allowing anonymous document sharing. En Marche! said it was not alarmed by the content, adding the documents “reflected the normal operations of a campaign” but had been mixed with fakes to “sow doubt and disinformation”.
Intelligence agencies in the US said in January that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had ordered hacking of Democratic campaign officials before last year’s presidential election in a bid to boost the chances of Republican candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.
Mainland France’s 47 million voters began casting their ballots at about 70,000 polling stations around the country at 8am (0700 BST). Usually reliable estimates of the result, based on a representative count of actual votes cast, will be released as the last stations close at 8pm (1900 BST).
Voting began in France’s overseas territories on Saturday, starting with Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, an archipelago near the Canadian island of Newfoundland, and continuing in other far-flung overseas territories and French embassies abroad.

Britain has more billionaires than ever in what equality campaigners said was a clear sign the UK economy is only working for the few at the top.
“While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain’s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the rich list.
Today, the Hinduja Group employs more than 70,000 people and has global investments in a range of sectors including oil and gas, property, media and banking. Current projects include the transformation of the Old War Office in Westminster into a luxury hotel.
The Equality Trust said the £83bn increase in wealth among the richest 1,000 people over the past year could pay the energy bills of all UK households for two and a half years and would be enough for the grocery bills for all food bank users for 56 years.
Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust, said that an elite was sitting on mountains of wealth in the fifth largest economy of the world. “The super-rich continue to streak away from the rest of us, while the poorest see their wealth shrink. This is an economy working for the few, not the many,” she said.
“Record numbers of people visited food banks last year, millions are locked out of a decent home and two-thirds of children in poverty are in working households.
“We know that inequality damages our economy and society, and makes it harder for ordinary people and their children to get on. With the general election fast approaching, our politicians need to decide the sort of country they want to build. One where we can all prosper or one where we’re picking crumbs from the super-rich’s table.”
At least 28 of the top 100 individuals or families in the rich list have donated to the Conservative party or individual Tory politicians, according to the Electoral Commission’s records. Among them are David and Simon Reuben, third on the list, who donated to Boris Johnson.
Others in the top 10 who donated to the party include Guy, George and Galen Weston and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, who donated to the West Suffolk Conservatives.
The combined wealth of all the Conservative donors on the list is £102bn, according to the analysis by Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. “The fact that nearly a third of UK’s 100 richest people have given money to the Tories tells you all you need to know about where Theresa May’s priorities lie,” Watson said. “She claims to speak for working people but she’s beholden to the billionaires that bankroll her party.”
Watts said there was more diversity in this years’ rich list. “More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with private equity barons and hedge fund managers.”

“I want teams to be worried that they have drawn Argentina,” he said, adding that, if his players were where he intended them to be come the World Cup, it would not matter whom they were up against, not that he will be dancing a jig if the Pumas find themselves facing the All Blacks again. As they are ninth in the rankings, they could be pooled with the holders, New Zealand, and their Rugby Championship rivals South Africa, whose annus horribilis in 2016 led to them slipping out of the top four.
Although 20 countries will take part in the World Cup, there will be only 12 names in the draw: the teams that finished in the top three of their groups in 2015. They have been split into three groups according to their position in the rankings: New Zealand, England, Australia and Ireland occupy the first tier, meaning they will avoid each other; then come Scotland, France, South Africa and Wales; and Argentina, Japan, Georgia and Italy form the third wave.
The other eight teams will be decided after qualifying matches in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Whoever draws Argentina could land Fiji, who were the other victims in England’s pool in 2015, Samoa or Tonga; or two of them.
Akira Shimazu, president of the tournament’s organising committee, has said: “Japan is preparing to welcome the world. We are committed to Rugby World Cup and we’re aiming to deliver the best yet. It will be a celebration of rugby and of Japanese culture as we will show off the best of our country and our hospitality on a global stage. The last World Cup was a great success but our task is not to emulate England but to make it a very Japanese event.”
Before the draw World Rugby will debate extending the residential qualification period for Test players. It is currently three years, but member unions are set to agree a recommendation to increase it to five. The change would not be retrospective and would not prevent the Sale wing Denny Solomona, who recently became available for England under the three-year rule, from touring Argentina with Eddie Jones’s side next month.

The go-ahead for the nation state bill by the ministerial committee for legislation means it will now move forward to a vote by the country’s parliament. The bill has to pass several stages in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for it to become law and could also be challenged in the courts.
Critics say the law is discriminatory and could undermine Israel’s balance of being both a Jewish and democratic state by harming the rights of minorities.
Hebrew and Arabic are both Israel’s national languages, but the bill states that Hebrew would be the lone national language, downgrading Arabic to “a special status in the state” whose “speakers have the right to language-accessible state services”.
The legislation is designed to be enshrined in Israel’s basic law, regarded as the closest approximation in Israel to a constitution.
The timing of the bill – after four years of deliberations – is significant, coming two weeks before a planned visit by Donald Trump in which the US president had hoped to breath life into a moribund peace process.
Although the bill has undergone some changes in the drafting process – not least removing language that would have seen Israel’s democracy subordinated in importance to its Jewish identity – it remains highly contentious.
While the way Israel’s legislative process functions has long allowed parties and individuals to put forward legislation likely to be challenged by the courts, the latest proposed law comes in the context of Israel’s most rightwing ever government.
The committee approved the bill unanimously but the measure has been condemned by opposition politicians, academics and in some parts of the Israeli media.
Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, representing Arab-Israeli parties, said the bill was a “declaration of war” on Israel’s Arab citizens. “Discrimination has received a legal stamp. The danger in this law in that it establishes two classes of citizen – Jewish and Arab,” he said.
Erel Margalit, a contender for the leadership of the centrist Zionist Union party, called the bill “reminiscent of dark periods” in history.
Zehava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, said the bill’s intention was to downgrade the rights of non-Jews in Israel. “The result of the Jewish state bill is clear. Jews will get preference over all other citizens, clearly violating human rights, democracy and the rights of the Arab minority in Israel,” she said.
The bill’s sponsor, Avi Dichter, an MP from Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, defended the proposals, as did other ministers.
 ”This is a small step for the Jewish state bill, which establishes that Israel is and will be a Jewish and democratic state, and it’s a big step towards defining our identity, not only in the eyes of the world but primarily for ourselves, Israelis – to be a free people in our land,” said Dichter after the committee’s vote.
He said the bill was necessary because “events of recent months prove that this is a battle for Israel’s image and national identity. The Palestinians no longer hide their goal of erasing the Jewish people’s nation state”.
The legislative committee’s chairman, Yariv Levin, also a Likud MP, said he had decided to put an end to foot-dragging over the bill. “We’ve been waiting to discuss and make a decision on this legislation for too long. This is a basic law, which has the simple objective of safeguarding Israel’s status as the nation state of the Jewish people. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been made into law so far,” he said.

Hargreaves, who is now retired after founding the Hargreaves Lansdown financial services company, said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of EU nationals before the delicate negotiations over Brexit. However, he said, May should simply “make the gesture” and not wait until Brussels agreed to do the same for UK nationals living in EU states.
It coincides with concern among some senior Brexit backers over May’s approach to immigration after Brexit.
Hargreaves said he was happy to see EU nationals already here maintain their current rights. “Most of those are in work and adding to our economy,” he said. “We are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future, but I think there should have been that comfort given, because they came under different circumstances.”
Wolfson said: “While it is important and essential that Britain controls who comes into this country, and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers … it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge.
“We are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war. If we are too draconian on immigration, it will have two adverse effects on our economy. The first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth, and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world.
“The most important thing to come out of Brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world – that Britain is an open country, a free trading country, one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it.”
Marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures, arguing that universities “must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post-Brexit economy”.
“It is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no-brainer to take students out of the migration numbers,” he said.
“Polling of Brexit voters even shows strong support for this change. People in the north and Midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector. They are simply not worried about student migration.”

Their capes bear the slogan: “Lafiyar al’ummarmu hakkin kowa da kowa ne” – “The health of the child is the responsibilty of all.” The lunchboxes are filled with ice and polio vaccine. They have marker pens to dab on the finger of each treated child and chalk to mark every house wall they visit, marking which child was vaccinated and when. No one is to be missed out.
Ismail has mixed feelings as he watches, his useless legs tucked under him in the dust. He contracted polio aged two. “I blame my parents,” he says, “for not having me vaccinated, it makes me angry with them. I don’t feel so glad to see this today, I feel sad.”
Meanwhile, in a nearby village, other gunmen were slaughtering eight women, another team of volunteers. Three days before, a radio show had run an item in which an imam repeated allegations that the polio vaccine was a western plot to sterilise Muslims.
“I can say this,” said Musa. “Without Boko Haram polio would be a thing of the past. Some say health is not the problem; security is. They are linked. If we hear one child in Maiduguri has polio, then that means there are 200. So what if there are 10 children there? And very many children are coming out of the conflict zone. We don’t know, so we have to work harder. We persuade people by educating them. You make them understand. We have reduced the non-compliance rate here now to almost zero. I tell our workers ‘your names are written in gold’.”
But with some religious leaders sharing the distrust, what should have been a celebration of a disease eradicated is now a renewed struggle to finish a job that should have been over. Since the outbreak in Boko Haram-controlled territory, northern Nigeria has been in emergency mode. Teams of vaccinators are out almost constantly. “I almost cried,” said Rhoda Samson, “but not to finish the job is not acceptable.”
A supervisor in the mobilisation teams, Samson is thorough, checking every move her teams make. They visit a woman whose five-day-old baby still has no name. The chalk on the wall outside shows a list of visits here. “Seven times they have said no,” said Samson as her team coo over the baby. “Bamaso,” said the mother, Amina Ali. “We don’t want. My husband says vaccine is not food, why do the government not give us food? He refused and has not offended God.”
At this her husband, Ali Zaki, returns home, angry at the invasion of his house: “I believe God will provide; this is what we are taught.” But he is no match for Samson: “You think God doesn’t make the medicines? You want your children to have polio? To never play? Does Allah want that? What kind of man are you?”
When Zaki grudgingly agrees, the vaccine is quickly slipped into the baby’s mouth and the women clatter off, congratulating the couple. “They’ve a lot of reasons for refusing. We have some who don’t want drugs at all, some who say they won’t because they want something in return, some hear the stories,” said Samson. “The security situation is a problem. People are suspicious, they hear vaccinations make infertility. But we are bringing the numbers of non-compliants down; we will not stop.”
And they are not just fighting polio – they are creating a network and collecting data in a way never before done in Nigeria. A network of trained, community-based health workers, it’s a structure already being used to deliver other healthcare.
Senior state and government officials have recognised the value of this, gracing the polio flag-offs. In their elegant robes and themed hats, and long, often less elegant political speeches, their presence stresses to everyone in the fidgeting crowds of locals that something important is happening here. It is the kind of message that could reverse the damage done by Boko Haram, says Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, Kano’s health commissioner. “Kano used to be a hub of polio cases, now it’s best practice. The last case was 2014 and this did not happen by accident. The teams are headed by the governor himself, it’s high profile This is how we do it. We go into the field every day, every day the volunteers are out there. Then we can use these structures to develop an entire primary healthcare system.”
Displaced people are especially targeted in this campaign. Abule Abdullah has hosted seven families – seven mothers and 33 children – in her home in Katsina state. One of her current guests is Aisha Idris, 40, recently arrived from Maiduguri.
“Boko Haram forced us to come here. The insurgency has stopped everything, the hospitals, the schools, everything is shut down,” she said. “My husband was killed at his Islamic reading group by a stray bullet from the fighting. My child was sick and so I came here with my children. I have to live with no roof over our heads but they have all been vaccinated now.” At the bus stations, and the state and national border crossings, the lunchbox-toting teams are there. Peering into cars, lifting the cloaks of women perched on motorbikes to find the babies strapped to their fronts and backs. Squeezing in the little vials of vaccine.
“If they say no, then we tell them they can go back,” said superintendent of immigration, Charles Tashllani, imposing order on Nigeria’s border with Niger in Katsina. Here, late in the evening, the Polio Emergency Operations committee reviews the campaign’s first day, which has seen 3,661 teams immunise 28,882 underfives. The detail is such that eight missing marker pens are on the agenda, as is the sacking of two town announcers who did not inform people about the programme.
“We look at every single child, everyone counts to us. I’m dealing with human beings. But we do have the iceberg phenomenon: many inaccessible, remote areas where we do not always know what is going on.
“People not feeling that polio is a threat to them, that is a big worry for a resurgence. But the biggest threat to health is Boko Haram. When we learned we had Borno refugees here in Katsina we were worried; they melt into the communities. It is potentially dangerous.”
The legacy of polio can be seen everywhere in Nigeria. Aminu Ahmen el-Wada lives with Hadza, his wife of 28 years, and those of their nine children who still live at home. One of life’s cheerful souls, he is enormously proud of the length of their marriage. “The trick is when I am the problem, I say sorry, when she is the problem, she says sorry,” says Wada.
The couple both skim along the floor using wooden handles Wada designed and carved to protect their hands – when your legs are withered from polio and are folded tiny and useless below your torso, your arms are the limbs that propel you. “I went to school until I became too heavy for my parents to carry me there,” said Wada. “So I taught myself to make hand-operated cycles, first for myself, then for others.” He now employs 20 people, 15 polio survivors. “Otherwise we would be beggars. This is because in Africa nobody can help you if you are disabled. But my father told me: ‘Disabled is in the body, not in the mind or in the heart,’ and this is what I believe.”
His smile falters only when he introduces Ummar, 14. His son contracted polio during a hiatus in the immunisation programme. “It was horrible. But the place behind our house is where people defecate. This is what happens.”
Wada began the Polio Survivors Group, which supports the vaccination drives. “I tell people: ‘Look at me. Do you want your child to end up like this? To never play football?’” Although he acknowledges the irony in that he also coaches a polio survivors’ para-football team. “But they would rather play for Arsenal,” he grins.
In his open-air workshop by the side of a main road in Fagge, the air smells poisonous as the men who would otherwise be beggars weld, cut and paint, making the three-wheeled, arm-operated cycles that give a certain freedom of movement. “This is the small size, for age five, then they can move up, age teenage, age adult,” he says. “One day I would like it that we make no more because polio is eradicated. Then we will make playground equipment instead, slides for happier children.”
He fires up his beaming smile: “Years ago in Nigeria we had leprosy, smallpox. We chased them all away. Now the last one is polio.”

This system is deemed to be democratic because people elect governments and can always vote them out; it’s capitalist because corporations are constrained by the logic of competition, which prizes efficiency, innovation and infinite expansion. That logic, with its penchant for creative destruction of all things stale and permanent, can produce toxic results – which is precisely why government action is needed. Such, at any rate, is the social democratic consensus accepted by both centre-left and centre-right parties.
The questions of war and security – and the existential imperatives that they impose on the most democratic of societies – have always posed unresolved challenges to this framework, as can be glimpsed from occasional warnings about the military-industrial complex expressed by many a political insider nearing retirement. Thus, standard democratic procedures are regularly suspended as governments demand tighter control over the flow of information, classify more of their internal communications and expand surveillance without any requisite checks and balances.
The standard critique of such practices attacks the undemocratic-because-unaccountable activities of the so-called “deep state”. Rooted in campaigns to defend privacy, opponents aim to make the deep state shallower – ideally by means of legal interventions aimed at restoring transparency and accountability. The real problem, they argue, is with the malfunctioning of democracy – we could easily ignore the capitalist part of “democratic capitalism”: we just need more and better legal instruments to tame the intelligence agencies.
Governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies – they are engaging in toxic activities of their own
Alas, the world in 2017 is not so easy to pigeonhole into the neat compartments of this scheme. Consider just one example: cyber-security. Plenty of rogue states are, indeed, busy hacking the servers of their adversaries in western Europe or North America. Likewise, there’s no denying that non-state hackers, operating for commercial or patriotic motives, have damaged their targets.
They do this for motives that some might view as noble: to identify early signs of terrorist activity, to track down criminals, to disable devices that might be part of sophisticated plots to wreak havoc on our cities. Whatever the motives, we should not lose sight of the larger political effects produced by such actions.
First, the expansion (and even the maintenance) of the surveillance capabilities of democratic governments presupposes a permanent structural insecurity of our communication networks. That insecurity, in turn, gets exploited not just by democratic governments but by anyone else, including all those rogue states and non-state hackers. However, once insecurity is structural, the right response is not more security, but more insurance. This explains why cyber-insurance has become one of the most promising segments of the insurance market, with even sectors like manufacturing (itself increasingly wired up and interconnected) needing to spend more and more to insure against disruptive cyber-attacks.
In essence, cyber-insurance – like any other form of insurance – is a domain of rentiers who are keen to extract a regular premium payment from those needing their services. The truly innovative element here is that the risk that creates this new class of rentiers exists partly – and, one could even say, mostly – because of government activity.
Here, the logic of democratic capitalism is no more: governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies; rather, they engage in toxic activities of their own, which companies mitigate with activities that are either more or less toxic – depending on one’s views about the parasitic nature of economic activities pursued by rentiers. The second political effect of the ever-expanding surveillance apparatus is the disadvantage it creates for small companies and non-profits, not to mention individuals. Remember the early utopian vision of a digital world, where we would all be running our own mail servers and, with time, might even master our own version of the connected home?
Well, today we demand more autonomy at our own risk: given the sophistication of cyber-attacks – which both aim to steal data and overwhelm sites with fake traffic – it’s obvious that the only actors capable of defending ordinary users, be they individuals or corporations, are big tech firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This, too, violates the basic premise of democratic capitalism: citizens are encouraged to seek protection from companies, not governments.
When both spam and security threats are assessed using the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, one can forget about any other, smaller player being able to compete with such firms that use the structural insecurity created by governments to further consolidate their near-monopoly status.
Democratic capitalism is thus always democratic monopoly capitalism – and even more so in its digital version. The idea that the normal imperatives of capitalist competition would exert extra pressure on digital giants seems quaint. There’s no garage big enough to house a startup that can unseat Google, not with its trove of customer data and artificial intelligence.
The third effect of this new post-democratic compromise is that, in presenting cyber-insecurity as a natural rather than human-made problem, it delegitimises the role of law – and politics in general – in mitigating conflicts between citizens and corporations. Consider how we deal with other types of disasters. It would be imprudent to rely on the power of law and politics to ward off floods and earthquakes; insurance, under these conditions, is not an unreasonable option. But none of this prevents us from requiring stricter building standards so as to minimise the damage when the disaster does strike.
The world of cyber-security does not follow this logic. Imagine if the government regularly dispatched a group of well-paid and well-educated saboteurs to weaken the anti-flood or anti-earthquake defences of our houses, leaving us no option but to turn to the private sector for security, either in the form of better defences or better insurance. This is the situation we are in right now; the only difference is that cyber-security disasters are almost entirely human-made and thus avoidable.
Rhetorically, the governments might even agree that, in the face of all these dangers, we all need to strengthen our privacy laws. In reality, though, we all know that it would only result in them sending even more saboteurs – with even more powerful tools – to weaken our defences. Who, under these conditions, would retain any faith in law and politics, rather than accept protections promised by the market, however flawed and expensive?
Cyber-security, alas, is just one of the many examples where the legitimacy of democratic capitalism – as well as of the social democratic parties that have traditionally defended it – has expired, even if its talking points are still in circulation. No wonder that social democratic parties are collapsing, as elections in the Netherlands and France have shown: they claim to be defending a system that no longer walks the talk.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Hak Song had worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before he was held on Saturday.
“A relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes,” the KCNA said.
Kim Sang Duk was arrested at the Pyongyang International Airport on 22 April, the KCNA said. It said he was “intercepted for committing criminal acts” to overthrow the North’s government, but didn’t elaborate.
On Sunday, the KCNA did not say whether the two cases were connected.
In Washington, the state department said it was aware of the report of the new detention and that “the security of US citizens is one of the department’s highest priorities”.
Kim Hak Song and Kim Sang Duk are among at least four Americans being detained in North Korea, as tensions between the two countries continue.
The others are Otto Warmbier, who is serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor for alleged anti-state acts, and Kim Dong Chul, serving a 10-year term with hard labor for alleged espionage.
Washington, Seoul and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, which in recent years have involved high-profile American missions sent to secure releases.
When an American citizen is reported detained, the US works with the Swedish embassy in the North Korean capital, since the US and the North do not have diplomatic relations.
The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is the only privately funded university in North Korea and is unique for having a large number of foreign staff.

Bzzz. Bzzz. I can still remember the sound and the feeling of having my head shaved for the first time. It was a warm evening in July, I had some kind of throat infection and we were about to go on holiday. I had been dyeing my hair various colours of the rainbow since I was 12. The only options I had left were green or … shaved. I was about to start a new job and felt, for a few reasons, that I was starting again. Shaved it would be. As my hair dropped to the floor, and we went shorter and shorter with the clippers, I felt lighter, liberated, ecstatic. It sounds ridiculous, but the effect was so powerful that my tonsils, or whatever it was, stopped hurting.
I had recently stopped drinking and I wanted to cut off the past and its boozy repetitions, to shed a side of me that was dangerous and destructive. I wanted to raze myself to ground zero and build myself back up again. Shaving my head felt like the most elemental and easy way to do it. Perhaps it was also a reaction against a conception of life as a sober person. It felt like an emboldening, a taking control of my identity, something anarchic and subversive in the face of a lifetime of Diet Coke, tea and early-to-bed. It also felt a bit brave, as if by doing it I could front away the fear of life without my crutch. In those early months, I felt raw, as if my skin had been removed, and having a shaved head somehow made me feel stronger.
When you find yourself drunk all the time, or hungover, your self-esteem can take a kicking. It took time to build mine back, but having a shaved head gave me a starting point. It also affirmed in me the simple concept of growth as intrinsic to life (well, for a while), that things change and move forward. Hair grows. Patterns can be broken. Neurons adapt.
The reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Friends seemed to like it, but elderly relatives? Not so much. My mother cried the first time she saw it, because she thought I looked ill. A friend’s mother told me it looked awful and scary. My grandmother was upset because it reminded her of images of people in Nazi concentration camps. I was a lot more comfortable at a festival or in a city rather than the rural corners of Scotland or the news desk of the newspaper where I was working at the time.
It is true that, historically, a shaved head is associated with some pretty bad stuff. Deposed emperors in Byzantium would have their heads shaved, along with castration and disfigurement. The Merovingians shaved the heads of dethroned kings or failed successors. French women who slept with German soldiers in the second world war had their heads shaved and were then paraded through the streets. It has been used as a tool to shame, dehumanise and mark in different cultures. It’s not all bad, though: Grace Jones said that shaving her head led directly to her first orgasm.
I kept my head shaved for a couple of years, enjoying the ease of my husband getting his clippers out, not costing a penny, wash and go. I loved the way my scalp felt like a velvety vole. But in a way, it was high maintenance. It required makeup and a proper outfit. And growing it out was a bore.

Three Australian swimmers are facing two-year bans from all competitions for missing three drugs tests over a period of 12 months.
“Swimming Australia confirms it has recently been informed by Asada and Fina that members of the Australian Dolphins Swim team may have failed to update their whereabouts appropriately over the previous 12-month period,” the Australian team said in a statement on Sunday.
All athletes in registered drug testing pools of international federations and national anti-doping organisations are required to provide their whereabouts for one hour every day (between 5am-11pm) when they will be available for testing. Asada said that at the point of each missed test, athletes have the opportunity to put forward an explanation before a missed test declaration was made.
Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson said he would be disappointed if protocols weren’t followed by the swimmers. “Both Swimming Australia and our athletes have been very clear on our position in relation to anti-doping both here in Australia and internationally,” Anderson said in a statement. 
“The Australian Dolphins Swim Team has worked hard to develop a culture of professionalism and respect. Part of that professionalism is ensuring each athlete is accountable and responsible for accurately providing their locations so testers can access them when required. It is extremely disappointing if this has not occurred as it should.”

The chalk on the wall outside shows a list of visits here. “Seven times they have said no,” said Samson as her team coo over the baby. “Bamaso,” said the mother, Amina Ali. “We don’t want. My husband says vaccine is not food, why do the government not give us food? He refused and has not offended God.”
At this her husband, Ali Zaki, returns home, angry at the invasion of his house: “I believe God will provide; this is what we are taught.” But he is no match for Samson: “You think God doesn’t make the medicines? You want your children to have polio? To never play? Does Allah want that? What kind of man are you?”
When Zaki grudgingly agrees, the vaccine is quickly slipped into the baby’s mouth and the women clatter off, congratulating the couple. “They’ve a lot of reasons for refusing. We have some who don’t want drugs at all, some who say they won’t because they want something in return, some hear the stories,” said Samson. “The security situation is a problem. People are suspicious, they hear vaccinations make infertility. But we are bringing the numbers of non-compliants down; we will not stop.”
And they are not just fighting polio – they are creating a network and collecting data in a way never before done in Nigeria. A network of trained, community-based health workers, it’s a structure already being used to deliver other healthcare.
Senior state and government officials have recognised the value of this, gracing the polio flag-offs. In their elegant robes and themed hats, and long, often less elegant political speeches, their presence stresses to everyone in the fidgeting crowds of locals that something important is happening here. It is the kind of message that could reverse the damage done by Boko Haram, says Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, Kano’s health commissioner. “Kano used to be a hub of polio cases, now it’s best practice. The last case was 2014 and this did not happen by accident. The teams are headed by the governor himself, it’s high profile This is how we do it. We go into the field every day, every day the volunteers are out there. Then we can use these structures to develop an entire primary healthcare system.”
Displaced people are especially targeted in this campaign. Abule Abdullah has hosted seven families – seven mothers and 33 children – in her home in Katsina state. One of her current guests is Aisha Idris, 40, recently arrived from Maiduguri.
“Boko Haram forced us to come here. The insurgency has stopped everything, the hospitals, the schools, everything is shut down,” she said. “My husband was killed at his Islamic reading group by a stray bullet from the fighting. My child was sick and so I came here with my children. I have to live with no roof over our heads but they have all been vaccinated now.” At the bus stations, and the state and national border crossings, the lunchbox-toting teams are there. Peering into cars, lifting the cloaks of women perched on motorbikes to find the babies strapped to their fronts and backs. Squeezing in the little vials of vaccine.
“If they say no, then we tell them they can go back,” said superintendent of immigration, Charles Tashllani, imposing order on Nigeria’s border with Niger in Katsina. Here, late in the evening, the Polio Emergency Operations committee reviews the campaign’s first day, which has seen 3,661 teams immunise 28,882 underfives. The detail is such that eight missing marker pens are on the agenda, as is the sacking of two town announcers who did not inform people about the programme.
“We look at every single child, everyone counts to us. I’m dealing with human beings. But we do have the iceberg phenomenon: many inaccessible, remote areas where we do not always know what is going on.
“People not feeling that polio is a threat to them, that is a big worry for a resurgence. But the biggest threat to health is Boko Haram. When we learned we had Borno refugees here in Katsina we were worried; they melt into the communities. It is potentially dangerous.”
The legacy of polio can be seen everywhere in Nigeria. Aminu Ahmen el-Wada lives with Hadza, his wife of 28 years, and those of their nine children who still live at home. One of life’s cheerful souls, he is enormously proud of the length of their marriage. “The trick is when I am the problem, I say sorry, when she is the problem, she says sorry,” says Wada.
The couple both skim along the floor using wooden handles Wada designed and carved to protect their hands – when your legs are withered from polio and are folded tiny and useless below your torso, your arms are the limbs that propel you. “I went to school until I became too heavy for my parents to carry me there,” said Wada. “So I taught myself to make hand-operated cycles, first for myself, then for others.” He now employs 20 people, 15 polio survivors. “Otherwise we would be beggars. This is because in Africa nobody can help you if you are disabled. But my father told me: ‘Disabled is in the body, not in the mind or in the heart,’ and this is what I believe.”
His smile falters only when he introduces Ummar, 14. His son contracted polio during a hiatus in the immunisation programme. “It was horrible. But the place behind our house is where people defecate. This is what happens.”
Wada began the Polio Survivors Group, which supports the vaccination drives. “I tell people: ‘Look at me. Do you want your child to end up like this? To never play football?’” Although he acknowledges the irony in that he also coaches a polio survivors’ para-football team. “But they would rather play for Arsenal,” he grins.
In his open-air workshop by the side of a main road in Fagge, the air smells poisonous as the men who would otherwise be beggars weld, cut and paint, making the three-wheeled, arm-operated cycles that give a certain freedom of movement. “This is the small size, for age five, then they can move up, age teenage, age adult,” he says. “One day I would like it that we make no more because polio is eradicated. Then we will make playground equipment instead, slides for happier children.”
He fires up his beaming smile: “Years ago in Nigeria we had leprosy, smallpox. We chased them all away. Now the last one is polio.”

This was a staggering, historic high for the anti-European, anti-immigration party that during the campaign was slammed by political opponents as racist, xenophobic, antisemitic and anti-Muslim despite Le Pen’s public relations efforts to detoxify its image in recent years. 
Political scientists have warned that no one should write off the French far right after Marine Le Pen’s presidential loss. The Front National has slowly been gaining ground for the last 45 years and its steady electoral increases must be seen in the long term. The issues that the party has sought to focus on and capitalise from – the terrorist threat, the refugee crisis, immigration, mass unemployment, deindustrialisation, voters who struggle to make ends meet – are unlikely to instantly disappear.
“The Front National is not finished,” said Jean-Yves Camus, director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean-Jaurès foundation in Paris. “We have no reason to believe that the job market will change for the better in the next few years. We have no reason to believe that the negative impact of globalisation will stop during the years to come. So there might be a drop in the Front National vote, but if the situation is bad in 2022 [at the time of the next presidential election], they could rise again.”
The Front National’s immediate focus now is the French parliamentary election to be held in two rounds on 11 and 18 June. The party only has two MPs in the 577-seat French national assembly and the current voting system – which does not feature proportional representation – makes it hard for the far right to translate millions of presidential votes into constituency seats. The Front National is hoping to win at least 15 MPs, which would be enough to have its own parliamentary grouping, but much depends on how the left, right and Macron’s new centrist En Marche! movement decide to field opposing candidates. 
Party strategists must now decide whether this can be translated to seats in parliament. Le Pen has not said if she will run for parliament herself.

They are blaming Simon Mayo for 'normalising' drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus
Yes, obviously the DJs mentioned booze loads and repeatedly implied that it was fine and nice. As Northumbria’s associate professor of public health and wellbeing put it: “Alcohol consumption is often portrayed as the norm without negative consequences, and just 5% of references on all stations were about sensible drinking.” That’s a lot more discussion of sensible drinking than I would’ve expected.
This is a bit of a soft target, you might think. Leave the guys at Northumbria University alone. If they can get funding for counting the number of times Steve Wright mentions Lambrusco, maybe I should wish them luck. But I don’t. Because it’s another case of people scrutinising how other people talk and vetting them for inadvertent divergences from an approved value system. A mild case, perhaps – these guys aren’t no-platforming Peter Tatchell – but they are blaming Simon Mayo for “normalising” drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus. The study will probably be ignored but, in these inane times, you just can’t be completely sure.
So it might be worth saying something obvious: DJs on the radio have to talk like human beings – the specific human beings they happen to be. That’s the premise of this form of entertainment: natural chat interspersed with music. It’s not high culture but it passes the time in heavy traffic.
But it won’t work if the people at the microphone, desperately trying to keep the energy up, also have to reflect some externally imposed consensus of how life should be lived. That’s Thought for the Day, which is scripted in advance and lasts under three minutes. Any longer than that and it really would drive listeners to drink…

When we say “addict”, we rarely think of people aged over 65. You might think this is uncommon. It isn’t. People expect to live longer, so they’re not slowing down just because they’re in their 60s. It shouldn’t be a surprise that we are seeing substance misuse, dependence and addiction in older people: think how many old fashioneds Don Draper got through in each episode.
We are woefully unprepared to meet the needs of older people struggling with substance misuse. So what will happen in 2030, when members of Generation X – the twentysomethings who popped pills at warehouse raves in the 1990s – start to turn 65? Addiction in older age is not a problem that’s going to go away. By 2030, nearly a quarter of the population in England will be over 65. That’s around 12 million people. We’re sitting on a ticking time bomb, waiting for the inevitable fallout of each generation overindulging in its substance of choice.
Lifetime use of cannabis and cocaine in 65- to 74-year-olds increased seven-fold and five-fold respectively between 2000 and 2014. In the last 10 years, the number of people in that age group admitted to hospital for drug-related mental health problems, such as psychosis, rose from 181 to 1,345. Use of prescription drugs for pleasure is also on the rise in older people, with opiates and medication for insomnia often used for non-medical reasons. As addiction services are being dismantled, more baby boomers with illicit drug misuse are entering old-age psychiatry services. Snorting cocaine, smoking cannabis or experimenting with psychoactive substances shouldn’t raise the eyebrows of psychiatrists providing care in older people’s mental health services, but even I initially failed my MRCPsych exams for lacking the necessary expertise on substance misuse. I didn’t realise how central it was to old-age psychiatry.
We wrongly assume that substance misuse is a younger person’s problem and there are huge challenges in increasing access to services for older people because of this.
When they do, they need care that not only addresses misuse, but takes into account chronic physical health problems and mental health conditions such as dementia. Treatment also has to manage the normal physical pain of ageing and the unfortunate truth of social isolation and bereavement.
Sadly, I see a future in which poly-substance misuse in older people is common. We have a lot of catching up to do to provide services for substance abuse beyond alcohol and tobacco. Baby boomers are the generation that laughed off inebriation, saw alcohol advertised daily on television and thought relaxation was more about smoking a joint than mindfulness.
But at what age do we assume people “grow out” of the pub night three times a week or smoking cannabis? The “you’re only young once” approach can easily go from a relaxed attitude in middle age to dependence and addiction in older life.
Substance misuse in the over-65s may seem strange because we characterise older people as fusty, but it’s not surprising that the attitudes of youth carry into later life. If we continue to ignore substance misuse in people over 65, we are closing the door on ensuring their quality of life as 70, 80 or 90-year-olds. In 2017, that door is still barely ajar.

She in turn called the former economy minister an arrogant, spoilt, cold-eyed, “smirking banker” who was colluding with Islamists, complacent on terrorism and intent on “butchering France” in favour of “big economic interests”.
Both accused the other of taking French people for imbeciles. At one point, after a long attack saying Le Pen was lying to the French public, Macron snapped: “I’m sorry, Madame Le Pen; France deserves better than you.” 
Snap polling by Elabe for BFM television just after Le Pen had left the TV studios, accusing Macron of “lies and aggression”, found that a clear majority felt the centrist candidate had been the most convincing. Viewing figures said 16 .5 million people watched the debate.
French media on Thursday declared Macron the winner of a “dirty debate”. Le Pen was criticised for her “permanent aggression” and even normally sympathetic publications found her “unconvincing”. 
Libération accused Le Pen of “multiplying attacks and provocations … and thus avoiding any serious debate” while Ruth Elkrief, political editor for BFMTV declared it “not worthy of a presidential election campaign”.
On jobs – one of the biggest concerns in a country that has struggled with decades of mass unemployment — Macron told Le Pen: “Your strategy is simply to tell a lot of lies and just to say what isn’t going right in the country.” She said he favoured “uncontrolled globalisation” and would sell off state assets to the highest bidder.
Although Le Pen was under pressure to flesh out her policy proposals, she spent more time attacking Macron and the record of the outgoing Socialist government.
Terrorism was another key issue after a series of deadly attacks killed more than 230 people in France in just over two years. Le Pen accused Macron of an “indulgent attitude” towards Islamic fundamentalism and said he was slack on fighting extremism. He replied he would be “uncompromising” on terrorism – which he called the biggest issue of the next few years in France – and said the state had to look at the social issues behind why so many terrorists who attacked France were born and raised in France. Le Pen, who this week said “globalisation and Islamism” were the main threats to France, retorted that Macron was lax on Islamism and disregarded French secularism.
Le Pen restated her plan to ban religious symbols from all public places, which would include the Muslim headscarf. Macron warned that her proposals would divide France and lead to “a civil war” and “that’s what terrorists want”. He said: “The terrorists want there to be divisions between us” and accusing his rival of “hate-filled speech”.
On the European Union, the candidates could not have been further apart. Le Pen, who wants to hold a referendum on France leaving the EU, and Macron, who wants closer cooperation, traded more insults on the subject. Le Pen said Macron as president would allow France to be crushed by its economically powerful neighbour Germany and would “lie prostrate” before the powers of Berlin. 
“France will be led by a woman, either me or Mrs Merkel,” Le Pen laughed, referring to the German chancellor. He meanwhile attacked her over her muddled stance on the euro. “The euro is the currency of bankers. It’s not the people’s currency,” Le Pen snapped back. Macron responded: “The euro is important. It’s not just a policy.”
Polls this week conducted before the TV debate showed Macron leading by 60% to 40% before the final-round vote on Sunday.
The stage-managed live TV sparring-match is a staple of French election campaigns. The format, in which the candidates face each other across a table for the cameras with no studio audience, has not changed for 40 years. But this bad-tempered exchange, which saw Macron and Le Pen repeatedly exchange insults with rather than expounding on policy, represented a political first.
After France’s two main parties, who had shared power for decades, were knocked out in the first-round vote last month amid anti-establishment anger, the two candidates who faced each other across the table were relative political novices. 
The very fact that Le Pen appeared in the debate was considered a major step in normalising her party. In 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the final, the right-wing Jacques Chirac refused to debate him on TV for fear of “normalising hate and intolerance”. 
Le Pen has tried to gain a grassroots presence across France and soften her party’s image, attempting to shake off the old jackbooted image of anti-semitism and racism under her Holocaust-denying father, but Macron in rallies has continually described her party as the “party of hatred”.
He said she lacked any knowledge of facts and was “feeding off” French people’s unhappiness. He said she was a “parasite” on the system that she was criticising, manipulating voters’ woes. “What class!” she interjected witheringly. 
Le Pen wants a France with closed borders and to prioritise French people over foreigners for jobs, housing and benefits, to send illegal immigrants home, to turn away from the European Union and to abandon free-trade deals. She hopes to solve unemployment by blocking immigration and taxing companies who hire foreigners.
Macron wants to increase European Union cooperation and says France cannot escape the globalised world. He wants to loosen strict labour regulations and reform the eurozone with a common budget.

Similarly, what does the supreme leader mean by “community”? It appears more than 80 times in his message, so it must be important. Close reading suggests that Zuckerberg hasn’t the faintest idea of what a real community is: a social group comprising people who don’t agree on everything (think of an English village) but who have devised ways of getting along and doing what needs to be collectively done.
“The reason the idea – that community-building on a planetary scale is practicable, necessary and altogether good – did not seem ‘controversial’ in the beginning was,” observes Carr, “that Zuckerberg, like Silicon Valley in general, operated in a technological bubble, outside of politics, outside of history. Now that history has broken through the bubble and upset the algorithms, history must be put back in its place. Technological determinism must again be made synonymous with historical determinism.”
Carr is right. The best reason for reading the Zuckerberg epistle in full is that it provides the best illustration we have of the degree to which Silicon Valley has become detached from reality. En passant, it also shows how someone can be both staggeringly clever and also astonishingly naive. Facebook’s supreme leader is not an evil person. He just knows little about the world that actual human beings inhabit.
There is also, I am sorry to say, a less charitable explanation. It is that he has concluded that what is wrong with the world – all the fanaticism, cruelty, warfare, myopia and xenophobia – is because some parts of the world are not yet on Facebook. If only they were all part of that mythical “global community” then everything would be OK.

“The vow is we must never, ever allow Forest to be in this situation again,” the relieved manager, Mark Warburton, said after the game. “Can’t happen. The last five or six weeks, the relegation dogfight, it’s not what we’re about. We told the players: ‘Remember the feeling at kick‑off’, and that must never happen again.”
Before the game at the City Ground Mick McCarthy promised that he wanted to give the Ipswich fans “something to smile about” despite having nothing to play for, but one imagines not many of the travelling support came away with grins on their faces. This was not so much a bad performance as a non-performance, unable to take advantage of the inevitable nerves from a relegation-threatened side.
Forest started with some purpose, going close through a curling Jamie Ward shot in the third minute, but the nerves showed when Jordan Smith fumbled a routine cross, like a child handed a valuable vase and sternly told to absolutely, 100%, under no circumstances break it. Shortly afterwards, though, Smith made a save that Warburton described as “world-class”, tipping the ball on to the bar while changing direction after a close‑range Grant Ward shot took a deflection. Given the nerves that showed in leaden legs and confused decision-making early on, that save probably kept Forest up.
Forest still looked jittery after the break, sitting deep and with little composure to their play. But after 57 minutes they doubled the lead: David Vaughan squared to the captain, Cohen, around 25 yards out and his shot took a flick off a defender on its way to the top corner. There could not have been a more appropriate and popular scorer than the club captain, making his 300th appearance after last season returning from his third cruciate ligament injury.
Ten minutes later Forest had the chance to remove all doubt, when professional irritant Ward won another penalty, this time barged to the ground by substitute Josh Emmanuel. Assombalonga stepped up and side-footed to Bialkowski’s left but the goalkeeper produced a wonderful save to tip the ball over the bar.
No matter, though. Five minutes later Assombalonga jinked down the side of the area, was shown on to his left foot by a backtracking Luke Chambers and, accepting the invitation, launched the ball into the roof of the net with that very foot. A few moments later Vaughan, as so often Forest’s most composed character in midfield, crunched into a (fair) tackle and, for the first time in a while at the City Ground, there was a sense that everything was going to be OK.
Warburton’s thoughts have already turned to the summer and next season, with a clear idea of how he wants to shape the squad with the help of Frank McParland, the director of football he called “the best in the business”. Warburton said: “We’re not proud of being in a relegation fight. It’s a muted celebration in that respect but the job’s been done and now we can build.”
At St James’ Park, goals from Ayoze Pérez, Chancel Mbemba and the substitute Dwight Gayle secured a deserved 3-0 victory against Barnsley in front of the owner, Mike Ashley, and a crowd of 52,276 at St James’ Park, and Jack Grealish’s last-gasp equaliser for Aston Villa denied Brighton victory to allow the Magpies to leap-frog them into top spot.
Rafael Benítez, the Newcastle manager, has insisted for weeks that promotion was the only objective, but as he prepares for the talks with Ashley which will determine whether or not he remains on Tyneside he will do so with a bonus piece of silverware sitting in the trophy cabinet.
Shorn of the services of Jamaal Lascelles and the winger Matt Ritchie through suspension and injury respectively, Benítez was forced to play the midfielder Isaac Hayden in central defence, although his problems grew when the former Arsenal man had to leave the field with a head injury. As a result, the Magpies were disjointed as they set about their task with Barnsley enjoying the better of the opening 15 minutes.
However, as the midfielder Christian Atsu roused them from their slumbers, they slipped into gear and took the lead with 23 minutes gone. Jonjo Shelvey expertly clipped Aleksandar Mitrovic’s lay-off into the path of Atsu, who cut inside the full-back Callum Elder before back-heeling the ball to DeAndre Yedlin to cross for Pérez to cleverly flick home.
The Barnsley goalkeeper, Adam Davies, did well to turn Atsu’s fierce shot over the bar after the winger had tricked his way past Elder with the visitors under intense pressure, and he excelled himself a minute before the break to deny the same man as he fired hard and low towards the far post.
The substitute Massadio Haïdara blazed over from 12 yards just before the break and Pérez tested Davies seconds after it as Newcastle dominated but struggled to kill off the game. That changed when Davies dived to save Pérez’s stinging 59th-minute effort, only for Mbemba to follow up from close range and make it 2-0.
Davies was called up once again 10 minutes later to tip over Mitrovic’s header and Shelvey struck the foot of the post two minutes later, but opposite number Rob Eliot had to make late saves from substitutes Marley Watkins and Elliot Lee to preserve his clean sheet. Gayle added a third at the death and news of Villa’s equaliser sent the home fans into raptures.
The Seagulls were already promoted, ending a 34-year exile from the top flight, and victory would have seen them go up as champions but they lacked urgency and rhythm for long spells.
Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said: “Today is a negative day, it’s difficult, but there are far more pluses. What these lads have achieved this season has been magnificent. David has been excellent for us all season and he had made two very good saves from free-kicks before. There’s never any portion of blame. We have to accept it as a team.
“For us the season is finished and we have achieved our goal. We’re playing in a division where there are some very big teams, who have spent big money, and we have managed to come in the top two.”
Brighton rode their luck in the first half and Henri Lansbury wasted a glorious Villa chance as the home side finished a disappointing season 13th with the manager, Steve Bruce, needing to revamp his squad in the summer.
Villa, relegated last year, had long hoped there would be a promotion party in Birmingham but it was the visitors who were celebrating going up – even if they struggled to get going. Lansbury’s low effort was shovelled wide by Stockdale during a low key start. It was competitive enough but there was little action until Lansbury somehow managed to head wide from five yards after Sébastien Pocognoli chested the ball into his path.
Brighton seemed too relaxed over their title chase and needed Stockdale to bail them out after another Pocognoli error after 33 minutes. The on-loan West Bromwich Albion defender played a blind backpass to slip in Scott Hogan but Stockdale deflected his shot wide and the goalkeeper was then needed again to save Conor Hourihane’s free kick.
There was little on offer from Brighton and they survived a huge penalty scare five minutes after the restart when Lewis Dunk tackled Keinan Davis but the referee, Darren Bond, waved away Villa’s protests. But the visitors suddenly woke up as Murray headed wide and then Baldock forced Sam Johnstone into a smart save just before the hour. And the title swung Brighton’s way when they went ahead after 64 minutes. Murray slipped in Baldock and he managed to scuff an effort at Johnstone, only for the referee to rule Baker had fouled him before he got his shot away. The defender was sent off and Murray scored from the spot, his 23rd goal of the season.
Four minutes later Brighton should have doubled their lead when James Chester blocked Baldock’s effort following Tommy Elphick’s short backpass. But while it remained 1-0 there was always a chance the Seagulls could lose the title and Stockdale had to produce a fine stop from Hourihane’s free kick with five minutes left. However, the 31-year-old then cost his side the league title when he allowed Grealish’s low 25-yard effort to sneak in with a minute left.

The shadow chancellor said those most affected by income tax increases would be “the 1% at the top”, a figure that roughly equates to the proportion already on the highest, 45% rate, of income tax.
McDonnell was careful to avoid being too specific but when questioned he declined to rule out raising the top rate of tax to 50p, saying the party was still “consolidating and confirming our manifesto”.
McDonnell had hinted earlier in the weekend that those earning over £80,000 would be asked to pay a “modest” increase. This would effectively create a new tax bracket for those earning between £80,000 and £150,000.
Conservative sources responded by claiming that McDonnell backed an even higher tax rise, pointing to a 2012 blog in which he called for “the restoration of progressive income tax of 60% on incomes above £100,000”.
Those earning high salaries would benefit in other ways from Labour’s manifesto, he told the audience at the Museum of London. “I want to pay tribute to those who do pay their taxes at the high level,” he said. “They make their contribution and we thank them for that. At the same time, we want a fair taxation system. If we upgrade our economy, we will create a richer society.”
“I’m not working on wild hypotheticals,” he said. “I think we’ve got a period of time in which we’ve not been able to get our policies across. Partly that’s the media, I have to say. I have to be straight about that. But also we are campaigning with a united party, our campaign has got to step up a notch. The general election starts now.”
On the ground, local Labour activists opposed to Corbyn have been discreetly compiling data from voters on whether a change of leadership could persuade them to back the party. Activists in a number of areas where the Labour vote slipped in the local elections, including parts of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and West Midlands, have been asking voters “what could we change that would persuade you to vote Labour?” according to canvass returns seen by the Guardian.
Canvassers mark papers with a ‘J’ if voters suggest changing the leadership. Those who suggest the Labour leader is the problem will get call-backs from the local Labour MP to try to bring in personal votes.
Alan Johnson, a Labour former home secretary who is stepping down as an MP at the election, said Corbyn had shown he could deliver his message to “rallies to hundreds of supporters in safe Labour territory,” but had to expand this reach in the election. “Here’s a chance for him to do that and he has to grasp [it],” Johnson told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.

And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (£78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn’t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (£356m).
One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: “Why did you do it?” At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: “I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.”
Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.
He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors’s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.
Why did I do it? I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer
Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?
“There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,” he says.
Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors’s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year’s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (£10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel “sick”.
“I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,” he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.
But it didn’t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. “I didn’t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,” he says. “It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You’re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don’t get to go outside and say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’”
Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn’t really see anyone who wasn’t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn’t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.
And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company’s liking. He did as he was told.
“Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?” he writes. “Should any such line be drawn at all?” I’m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?
“I think it’s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that’s what I wish I had done much earlier,” he says. “But it’s very easy for me to say: ‘Follow your own morals and it will be fine.’ But it won’t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you’ll begin to run into trouble.” He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it’s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.
I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. “I don’t want to say,” he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned “a seven-figure sum”. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.
“You get these bonus cheques, but there’s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I’ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.” At £1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.
But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn’t perform well, and he felt short-changed.
I didn’t think about the system as a whole. You never say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’
“Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It’s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn’t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It’s more like you’ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.”
Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.
I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says – he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. “The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.”
But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He’s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? “I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,” he says, “but I don’t think so.” He says he couldn’t do it without becoming obsessed again.
Does he miss the money? “Of course, it’s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn’t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.”
A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: “Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn’t spend much time thinking about it – at least not until it was too late.”
“That was the only thing that I really liked,” he says now. “Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.”
I think he should stick to lecturing.
Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time – but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.
During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo Häyhä. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when Häyhä was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: “I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.” Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed “snipers”. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees – no matter what their job description is.
I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.
I wouldn’t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I would become
“Don’t worry,” I was told. “We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.” I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee’s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.
Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.

He much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches
At 67, still a man mountain at 6ft 4in, face leathery as a saddle-bag and with his latest hairpiece perfectly in place, it seemed he much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches from toffs in bowler hats and pub brawls to cars leaping across Tower Bridge.
Colourfully and unrestrainedly, it was “fucking” and “goddamn” this, or “shit” and “asshole” that as Wayne, one of Hollywood’s most vocal right-wingers, laid into everything and everyone from “whining radicals who call themselves liberals” and “theatre actors who couldn’t polish a bit player’s shoes” to “bank presidents and stock manipulators running studios who know nothing about motion pictures”.
To make that day even more memorable, his often gleefully intemperate tirades were constantly punctuated by painful throat-clearing and phlegmy hawking which, within minutes, had swiftly evolved into an ear-splitting series of wracking coughs and sonorous spitting (into a hanky).
Yet, as Wayne – who had bravely gone public with his lung cancer, coining the term “The Big C”, just a decade earlier – battled his turbulent throat on this warm day in summer, he never showed any obvious signs of weakening or remotely giving in as I offered the occasional, feeble, “It must be very unpleasant” or “Would you like me to leave?”
Someone once wrote: “Film stars don’t die in Liverpool.” Well, they certainly aren’t meant to peg out in Perivale, west London, either.
In fact, the wheezier he became, the more he seemed to warm to his harangues, which also included “today’s filmmakers who’d let all illusion go out the window”.
When, I asked, would he finally call it a day? “I’m gonna finish,” he declared in that famous drawl, “when they say: ‘Oh, do we have to look at that old sonofabitch again?’”
He died in 1979 after completing just two more pictures.

According to the Washington Post, its reporter’s phone was grabbed by event organisers who blocked attempts to interview investors and ordered reporters to leave. “This is not the story we want,” a PR representative was quoted as saying.
Similar events at five-star hotels were scheduled to follow in at least three other Chinese cities: Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. 
On Sunday afternoon investors were due to gather at the Four Seasons hotel in Shanghai’s glamorous former French concession, according to one Shanghai-based consultant for Qiaowai. “Invitation is free of charge,” the consultant told the Guardian. “If you offer to invest in the project, then you would sign a contract and have certain fees to pay.”
It is not clear whether Kushner’s sister will also speak at those sessions but Qiaowai’s website said a number of “VIP guests” would be present including Ben Curtiss, the vice-president of Kushner Companies. Investors would have “opportunities to speak with these distinguished guests”, Qiaowai’s website promised.

Jonny Bairstow has done all he can to nudge England towards a rethink of their plans before this summer’s Champions Trophy with his brutal exhibition of hitting and the golden arm of Joe Root setting up an 85-run win over Ireland at Lord’s.
Asked to bat under initial grey skies, England hustled their way to 328 for six with Root and Morgan striking 73 and 76 respectively in a stand of 140 before Bairstow turned on the afterburners at the back end of the innings with an unbeaten 72 from 44 balls.
Facing a target one greater than their famous chase of 328 against the same opposition in Bangalore six years ago, Ireland were bowled out for 243 in 46.1 overs as Root’s off-breaks returned three for 52 and Liam Plunkett took three for 23. Nevertheless, individuals stood up for the supportersin green, with 82 from the captain, William Porterfield, following a brawny 48 by the Middlesex opener Paul Stirling.
Stirling’s initial salvo, one of eight crunched fours and a mighty six over the ridiculously short boundary, was, truth be told, the only time England looked as if they might end up grateful for the late flourish to their own innings, where 61 runs were reaped from the final four overs as Bairstow put on something of a show for the 23,000-strong crowd.
The Yorkshireman is due to be a drinks-carrier when Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler return from the Indian Premier League to face South Africa this month before the summer’s main event. But as he mowed Ireland’s bowlers to all parts his inability to command a regular place seemed all the more baffling. At the very least the position of first reserve ahead of Sam Billings – who was given the gloves ahead of him in Buttler’s absence – has surely been locked down.
Putting on 88 in 7.4 overs with his county team-mate Adil Rashid, who wristily flicked a 25-ball 39 from No7 himself, Bairstow delivered his full repertoire, standing tall with his high backlift and manipulating boundaries through power and placement.
Bar one heart-in-the-mouth moment, when George Dockrell held him on the midwicket rope on 43 only to tumble over and throw the ball back into play, he positively glowed in the form that brought him 1,470 Test runs last year, cracking seven fours as well as three sixes.
After heads understandably dropped in the field on Friday, Ireland’s performance in the field was much sharper. Tim Murtagh got the new ball to nibble first up on his home ground, castling Alex Hales on 32 with one that seamed up the slope, while his fellow right-armer Barry McCarthy – until some late tap from Bairstow – was the pick with two for 61.
Porterfield rotated his attack throughout, making 23 bowling changes in a bid to prevent the home side settling. Settle they did, however, after Hales and Jason Roy fell in the space of three overs – the latter picking out extra cover to make it 60 for two in the 13th – with Morgan and Root then easing to half-centuries at around a run a ball when an England team of old might have consolidated.
Morgan, whose one wobble before eventually chipping McCarthy to extra cover came on 39 when a ball from Stirling’s off-spin trickled on to the stumps without disturbing them, carved the bowlers in typical fashion thereafter, while Root glossily stroked his way to a fifth 50-plus score in seven innings this year before picking out mid-off.
England struggled early in the reply – not least David Willey, who saw his three overs with the new ball crashed for 23 runs and did not return – but after Jake Ball removed Stirling in the 14th over, thanks to a faint snick behind picked up on review, the second innings belonged to Root, who bowled the full allocation for the first time in his one-day career.
Castling Ed Joyce with a sliding round-arm delivery for 16, and then getting Niall O’Brien and Gary Wilson held in the deep, Root’s form with the ball may be the best way for his fellow Yorkshireman, Bairstow, to be retained in a move that would mean England leaving Moeen Ali out as they have during this mini-series.
With Chris Woakes similarly coming back from the IPL, Plunkett made sure he will not be one to make way following a strong tour of the Caribbean in March by trapping Andy Balbirnie lbw with an 89mph delivery and persuading both Murtagh and McCarthy to pick out Ball on the rope in his second spell.
Rashid followed his five-wicket showing in Bristol by ending Kevin O’Brien’s brief repeat of his Bangalore six-hitting on 18. Mark Wood, who along with Willey endured some early butchery from Stirling, snuffed out Portferfield’s vigil when he was bowled trying a flick down leg, before completing the win by crashing a yorker into Dockrell’s stumps.

Enlightenment values – tolerance, respect for the importance of fair debate, checked and balanced government, objectivity and impartiality, recognition of international interdependencies – are being trashed. Matters could get very ugly, very fast. It is not just Europe we are leaving, but an idea of Britain.
The chill can only increase as the scale of the gulf between Britain and Europe becomes clearer. If Britain does crash out of the EU, possibly with sanctions being imposed by our former partners because we refuse to pay what they consider are our proper financial obligations, there could be a further run on sterling, a collapse in overblown property values, a second banking crisis and a deep recession. Worse, the enmity towards Europe thus provoked will poison British popular attitudes, as we suffer a lost decade or more, as our weak economy struggles to compensate for lost markets in Europe. Any deal is better than no deal.
We need our principal opposition party to force potential responses into the national conversation – federalising the constitution to avoid the risk of national break-up, rebuilding our relationship with Europe, repurposing our economy and reaffirming a new social contract. These would address the challenges in a way that inspires hope. The shrunken Labour party and its leadership’s preoccupation with yesterday’s failed leftism will be incapable of holding May to account. Or, because of the weakness of its electoral support, it has not the heft to threaten political consequences if she backs off from confronting her party’s right and its media allies.
It is a perfect storm. Corbyn must be persuaded to promise that, in the event of the likely crushing defeat, he will stand down after the election, offering Labour MPs some chance of saving themselves and their party. It is improbable. Maybe Labour will be so broken that a new party, with roots in the best of the British working class and committed to Enlightenment values that unite the best of our political traditions, will have to be started with a clean slate. It’s going to be a long hard road ahead.

Under Ireland’s Defamation Act 2009 a person who publishes or utters blasphemous material “shall be guilty of an offence”. A conviction can lead to a fine of up to €25,000.
While being interviewed on The Meaning of Life TV programme, Fry was asked what he would say to God if he had a chance.
“I’d say ‘Bone cancer in children, what’s that about?’ How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault,” Fry replied. “It’s not right. It’s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?”
Fry said if he met the Greek gods he would accept them quicker because, “they didn’t present themselves as being all seeing, all wise, all beneficent”. 
“Because the god who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish. We have to spend our lives on our knees thanking him. What kind of god would do that?”
“I told the garda I wanted to report Fry for uttering blasphemy and RTÉ for publishing/broadcasting it and that I believed these were criminal offences under the Defamation Act 2009.
“The garda then took a formal written statement from me in which I quoted Fry’s comments in detail. This written statement mentioned both Fry and RTÉ specifically.”
He said he was asked by the garda if he had been personally offended by the programme and if he wished to include this in the written statement. 
“I told the garda that I did not want to include this as I had not personally been offended by Fry’s comments – I added that I simply believed that the comments made by Fry on RTÉ were criminal blasphemy and that I was doing my civic duty by reporting a crime.”
After hearing nothing for 18 months, the complainant wrote to the head of the Irish police, Commissioner Noirín O’Sullivan, “asking if the crime I reported was being followed up. A few weeks later I got a standard ‘we have received your letter’ from her secretary.”
But recently the man was contacted by a detective from Donnybrook garda station in Dublin (the same suburb where RTÉ is headquartered) to say they were looking into the blasphemy claim. “He said he might have to meet me to take a new more detailed statement.”
“I was merely saying things that many finer heads than mine have said for hundreds of years, as far back as the Greeks ... I never wished to offend anybody who is individually devout or pious, and indeed many Christians have been in touch with me to say that they are very glad that things should be talked about.”
The host of the The Meaning Of Life programme, Gay Byrne, said “Of course [Fry] hadn’t wished to cause offence. But that’s what the internet is for, controversy, debate and people’s opinions.”

The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.

I’m a sucker for the American west as seen from a bus and I loved the wild, magical, almost mystical portrayal of the landscape in this coming-of-age road movie by Andrea Arnold. I also loved the tender relationship between the main character, who has run away to join a circus-like group of teenage sales people in the US, and the animals she keeps trying to save. Her familiar longing to save these little creatures from an unpredictable world is almost godlike and echoes the viewer’s desire to see her and her young friends safely delivered to a better future.
Sorry to choose a reissue for the music choice. I have to admit that at some point, I think my late 30s, I decided I had enough music to last me a lifetime and stopped being hungry for new stuff. Music still feels like a lifeline to me but like most other middle aged people, I’d rather listen to music I’m already familiar with. When I left London, I gave away or sold my record collection, most of which was covered in candle wax and jam. I still find it thrilling and the greatest possible luxury to be carrying around all my music in my pocket and be able to find whatever I’m looking for within moments. But I digress. I chose this album because it’s just been rereleased and so counts as something sort-of new. I completely missed Elliott Smith the first time round, I’m not sure how, and was introduced to this album by my husband. It’s now one of my all-time favourites – it’s start-to-finish absolute perfection. I don’t have much tolerance for sad music, but this is gentle and smart and somehow weirdly comforting, and it’s not depressing at all.
I’m so ashamed that I bought the lie that Bernie had no chance of being elected if he won the Democratic nomination. Looking back, I think that was totally wrong. I’ve been ignoring American politics since I’ve lived here, partly because the system seems so messed up and partly because I believed Obama was genuinely a good guy and if he couldn’t do it, it couldn’t be done. Reading this book was a huge eye-opener. I’ve also woken up to the fact that I need to start paying attention and doing what I can. I was just in South Carolina with a friend, helping to register voters for the special election there in June. I hope the extremity of what is happening in the US now gives birth to a truly progressive revolution. The Women’s March was incredible and it’s been heartening to see how many grassroots campaigns are springing up.
Ram Dass was a big-shot Harvard psychology professor in the 60s [under the name Richard Alpert], until he found himself in the office next door to Timothy Leary, which led to drinking the Kool Aid and getting himself very publicly dismissed. In an effort to find a more sustainable high, and to seek the origin of the truth he had glimpsed while taking psychedelics, he traveled to India and found his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. He came back to the US and became one of the archetypal 60s spiritual teachers who spread the teachings of the east to the west. He’s funny and wise and I love him. This book is a recently compiled collection of his writings. Ram Dass is in his eighties now and has lost the ability to speak fluently after suffering a stroke, so this book is read by his pal Rameshwar Das, who does a great job.

Le Pen says she's not 'against immigrants, just against immigration' – it's like being against juggling but not jugglers
And what of her opponent? For Le Pen, Macron represents “a morbid continuity, littered with the corpses of jobs transferred offshore, the ruins of bust businesses, and the gaping holes of deficit and debt”. (Such apocalyptic metaphors of death and decay are, it must be admitted, very fascist.) Macron himself is having none of it. Le Pen, he says, is “a threat to democracy” who propagates “dangerous untruths”; she leads a party that still promotes “hatred” and is against “liberty”. It’s promising the people “presents”, but they are “lies” that the party could never finance. (One thinks mildly here of £350m a week for the NHS.)
So will the French vote for the people, the Republic, la France, or something else? The Front National, Macron warned this week, is actually “the anti-France party” – an interesting choice of words, given that the phrase “anti-France” was first coined by the French far right who imagined Jewish conspiracies at the end of the 19th century. The civilised choice is clear, but when each side accuses the other of being the enemy of the people, one may forgive the people for thinking they don’t have many friends left in high places.

She now has the right to live and work in the UK permanently after Brexit, irrespective of the outcome of negotiations between Brussels and London. 
She swore allegiance to the Queen and completed a “life in the UK” test to prove she was assimilating into British culture, even though she is bilingual, has lived in the country for most of her adult life and is married to a British man with whom she has two British children.
Hawkins, like other EU nationals receiving British citizenship, was handed a standard letter from the home secretary congratulating her on her new status. In a sign of the struggle the Home Office is facing dealing with the volume of applications from EU citizens, the letter was signed by Theresa May, who stepped down as home secretary when she became prime minister almost a year ago.
“I am delighted to finally be British, having felt part of this wonderful and beautiful country for many years now,” said Hawkins. “The ceremony was quick, it felt odd. I have very mixed emotions about it.”
It was a bittersweet moment for the IT consultant. She no longer has to worry about her status post-Brexit but, on the downside, she has learned that she has lost several rights conferred under EU freedom of movement laws.
“Some time after submitting my application in January, I was horrified to learn from a lawyer that in fact by becoming a dual-national British citizen, I have signed away several rights that I had before,” she said. 
The first thing Hawkins did following the citizenship ceremony was register to vote in the general election, something that EU citizens are not eligible to do, bar the Irish, Maltese and citizens of the Republic of Cyprus. She said she was “especially pleased” to be able to vote in an election that would affect the future of the three million EU citizens living in the UK.
She said she was concerned about other EU citizens who, after the referendum, discovered they were not entitled to be here because they were caring for a disabled child; were stay-at-home parents; or students who were not notified by the Home Office or their universities that they were required to have private health insurance to stay. “These are the people I worry about, that is what keeps me awake at night,” Hawkins said. 
 She has been asked to speak at at an event organised by the Dutch MEP Sophie in ’t Veld, who set up the parliament’s task force in January to look into the rights of people and families affected by Brexit.
Last December, Hawkins described her treatment by the Home Office as being as “absurd as a Monty Python sketch”.
She had sent officials an 85-page permanent residency application along with documents such as historic employment records, council tax statements and proof of absences from the country. However, the Home Office refused her application on the grounds that she had sent in a notarised copy of her passport rather than her original, which she needed for travelling to the Netherlands to handle the paperwork generated by the death of her father.
“As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom, you should now make arrangements to leave,” the rejection letter stated.

The president used his favorite bullhorn, Twitter, on Sunday to begin the lengthy process of browbeating wavering Republican senators into line. “Republican Senators will not let the American people down!” he said.
Republican Senators will not let the American people down! ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up - it was a lie and it is dead!
His chief of staff, Reince Priebus, signaled that a more dignified pace of debate might be tolerated in the Senate, in contrast with the unseemly haste of the House. “Everyone is excited and ready to go to work and take the time necessary to look at the bill … No one’s going to be beating down their door,” he said on Fox News Sunday.
But there were already alarming signs for the White House of a groundswell of discontent among moderates that presages a stormy ride in the Senate. Susan Collins, the senator from Maine who is an expert on healthcare, vowed to effectively bin the House bill and start all over again.
Making a veiled dig at the breakneck speed of the passage through the House, she told ABC’s This Week: “The Senate is starting from scratch. We are going to draft our own bill and I am convinced we are going to take the time to do it right. We will come up with a whole new approach.”
John Kasich, the governor of Ohio who sought the Republican nomination for president, sounded the alarm over the plan to rein back Medicaid expansion. He said that could impact 700,000 people in his state, a third of whom have mental illnesses or experience drug addiction.
“What happens to those people?” he asked on CNN’s State of the Union. “They give you a $3,000 or $4,000 tax credit to buy insurance. What do you think they can buy for that?”
Kasich also raised the other knotty problem that is causing divisions within the Republican party: pre-existing conditions. He was derisive about the $8bn subsidy allowed under the House bill to help set up “high-risk pools” to insure people with pre-existing medical conditions in states that opt to allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums to such individuals.
“These high-risk pools, they aren’t funded,” Kasich said, “$8bn is not enough. It’s ridiculous. States are not going to opt for that.”
Trump’s health and human services secretary, Tom Price, side-stepped questions over cuts to Medicaid and cover for pre-existing conditions. He stuck to his official line, telling CNN “the winners under Obamacare were the federal government and insurance companies, the winners under the program we provide will be patients and families and doctors”.
Underlying the increasingly bitter fight are concerns that if the legislation ends up hurting millions of Americans the party could itself be punished. 
As Republican leaders downplayed the threat of a rout in 2018, Priebus, a former chair of the Republican National Committee, went so far as to suggest that voters would thank his party.
The electorate, he said, would “reward the Republicans that sat up and said, ‘We are not going to see the Obamacare system, which is failing and collapsing, continue any longer.”
The speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who was instrumental in ramming the legislation through, called the bill a “rescue mission”. He told ABC: “We are proud of this effort, it’s us keeping our promises and it’s a lot better than Obamacare.”
After the comment, his audience erupted in jeers and boos.

At least the ensuing war of words and public emotion shows that both sides realise just how much is at stake. The truth is that the upcoming negotiations will be incredibly complicated, for both technical and political reasons.
For example, how can we deal with the land border in Ireland? The new arrangements will have major implications for business and trade but also for the hundreds of thousands of people in the north with a passport from the republic. Nearly 20,000 workers commute across the border. These are not technical issues but questions with far-reaching political consequences, including for the peace process.
And Northern Ireland is only one of many such issues, where technical complexity meets political tension. Perhaps most important is the need to reach a deal that defines the rights of expats on both sides. But which rights should these migrants keep? A British citizen living in Spain currently has the right to vote in local elections. Should this be preserved? What about the French student who pays domestic rates at a London university? And how do we process the pension rights accrued by a Polish worker who spends six years in the UK but then leaves? The EU has mechanisms for these situations, and lives were planned around the existing rules.
Whatever the agreement on citizens’ rights, they must be enforceable and protected. So who will watch over them, and what will be the relevant jurisdiction? Theresa May talks of escaping oversight by the European court of justice (ECJ), while the EU wants the ECJ to adjudicate. All of these questions are technically fraught and politically charged, but both sides have repeatedly insisted that citizens’ rights are a priority. So now they must deliver. The UK and European public rightly expect politicians to sort out the mess and minimise the damage to people’s lives.
A second issue is future trade relationships. On a technical level, this should actually be easy to agree. We are not talking about a trade deal between two vastly different economies: on the contrary, the Great Repeal Act will translate the current body of EU law into British law. Thus, on the day of Brexit, standards and regulations will essentially be identical. The questions here are whether either side imposes tariffs, and how to deal with future regulatory divergence. These are standard topics, often negotiated in trade agreements, and they are less complex than the fine detail of migrant citizens’ lives.
With political will, a sensible trade agreement is in reach. A deal that primarily covers goods, rather than investment and services, could easily be passed on the EU side. More elaborate agreements would require unanimity, and the recent near-collapse of the EU-Canada Ceta agreement shows that this can be tricky to achieve. But still, it is in both sides’ interest to avoid a no-deal scenario and a fallback to WTO rules.
A final big issue is the infamous “Brexit bill”. Although economically insignificant, politically this might be the most toxic issue. It is important to understand that even a sum of €60bn would not be at all threatening to the UK’s economic fortunes – it is around 3% of UK GDP, and it would be spread over a number of years. But for politicians the bill is extremely explosive, mostly because of the emotional headlines it will trigger on both sides.
After Brexit, economic and political links between the EU and the UK will be weaker. But the UK will still be the EU’s closest neighbour and an important ally. It is time to discuss in earnest how to soften the damage of Brexit for citizens and business on both sides. And it is time to explore how to structure future cooperation in fighting terrorism. Brexit will not be a success, but aiming for failure serves no one. Goodwill and a sense of perspective are the way to protect the EU and UK alike.

Look at a map of the country and you can see how our old cities were built around rivers, back when people used them daily as a source of water or trade, or for sewage. Today, we rely on them less – but they still play a vital part in British life, and hide some fascinating stories. Here are just a few of the most interesting things about them.
In 1909, the Gloucester and Sharpness canal was in danger. The nearby river Severn was widening day by day and threatened to spill over into the neighbouring waterway. Something had to be done urgently, so the canal company had the idea of killing two birds with one stone. They would shore up the riverbank and decommission some old boats at the same time, by beaching them where the land was thinnest.
 In so doing, they created a unique mausoleum of British nautical history. Barges, schooners and trows – cargo boats with masts that could be taken down to go under bridges – continued to be added until the 1970s, including the Catherine Ellen, a two-masted schooner that had been involved in the Irish War of Independence, and the two barges that caused the 1960 Severn Railway Bridge disaster, when five men lost their lives.
The Avon comes from the Celtic “abona”, via the Welsh “afon”, which just means “river”. As a result, there are eight Avons in England and Scotland, and even an afon Afan in Wales. In the same way, both the Wye and the Wey, a tributary of the Thames, seem to derive from Celtic “weg”, meaning “flowing water”. Thankfully our forebears found time for a double bluff now and then. It makes sense that Cambridge should be the name of the city that straddles the river Cam, but in fact it worked the other way round. Originally called the Granta, on which the city of Grantebrycge was founded, the river changed its name after the city did.
The stretch of the Thames between Kingston and Oxford is one of the most famous sections of river anywhere in the world. This is not because many celebrities have mansions there, although many do – including George and Amal Clooney – but because this was the section travelled by Jerome K Jerome and his friends George Wingrave and Cart Hentschel in a series of short holidays, which became the basis for one of the world’s most uneven yet greatest comic novels, Three Men in a Boat (1889). Though the book may seem like a self-deprecating love letter from the English to themselves, it sold more than a million (mostly bootleg) copies in the US, was a huge hit in Germany and Russia, and has been translated into virtually every language that exists in print. Retracing the route in the story is a popular pilgrimage with fans, not least because the towns and even many of the pubs that Jerome writes about are still there.
Or a percentage of your home at any rate, through one of the country’s 200 or so hydroelectric power stations. To fill you in, hydroelectricity was one of the first forms of renewable power to be generated in Britain, or indeed anywhere. In fact its roots are ancient, since these plants are essentially just grand water wheels, which make water turn a turbine as it flows downhill. This is usually done by damming a river and controlling the flow. Britain’s hydroelectric plants, most of them in Wales and Scotland, supply 1-2% of the country’s electricity, though there is scope to build more. They are especially useful because they can be turned on and off fairly easily according to demand, unlike wind and solar.
The Canal & River Trust cares for 2,000 miles of waterways across England and Wales. It’s a fascinating network full of life, that’s free and open to all, and where there’s something for everyone – whether you are walking your dog, having a family day out or simply want a moment to yourself.

The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”

Cleaning up all that was straightforward: turn the machine down to 30C and use an eco detergent.
In terms of plastic fibre volume, a city the size of Berlin may be responsible for releasing the equivalent of 540,000 plastic bags’ worth of them into the ocean daily.
That sounds overwhelming, but the more natural fibres you wear (such as cotton), the better. Frequently washed items should be non-synthetic where possible.
With the rise of the clean beauty movement it can be difficult navigating the plethora of products out there that claim to be natural and organic.
Green People, celebrating 20 years in the business, is the real deal. This is the brand that defined what it means to be organic.
Back in 1999, founder Charlotte Vøhtz, was invited to be on a committee for the Soil Association (the UK body with the most stringent organic certification) to design the first standards for organic beauty.
Vøhtz’s drive to create her truly organic skincare range began when her young daughter Sandra was battling multiple skin allergies and eczema. Now her brand offers 160 sustainable skin and hair products (including two special anniversary ranges), but nothing that has been diluted or bulked out with high levels of water, drying alcohol or synthetic fillers.

Hargreaves, who is now retired after founding the Hargreaves Lansdown financial services company, said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of EU nationals before the delicate negotiations over Brexit. However, he said, May should simply “make the gesture” and not wait until Brussels agreed to do the same for UK nationals living in EU states.
It coincides with concern among some senior Brexit backers over May’s approach to immigration after Brexit.
Hargreaves said he was happy to see EU nationals already here maintain their current rights. “Most of those are in work and adding to our economy,” he said. “We are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future, but I think there should have been that comfort given, because they came under different circumstances.”
Wolfson said: “While it is important and essential that Britain controls who comes into this country, and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers … it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge.
“We are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war. If we are too draconian on immigration, it will have two adverse effects on our economy. The first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth, and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world.
“The most important thing to come out of Brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world – that Britain is an open country, a free trading country, one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it.”
Marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures, arguing that universities “must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post-Brexit economy”.
“It is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no-brainer to take students out of the migration numbers,” he said.
“Polling of Brexit voters even shows strong support for this change. People in the north and Midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector. They are simply not worried about student migration.”

Do they kiss their mommas with those mouths? When interviewed, marchers said that Trump was an “embarrassment” and “unwelcome”. In the end, Trump completed his official engagement and veered back to his New Jersey golf course without even popping in to Trump Tower to see if he could find which cupboard Melania had frantically hidden in this time.
What’s the betting that Trump was sitting in the back of his car pulling his maddest, crossest presidential face – you know, the one that makes him resemble Mount Rushmore before the stonemasons started work?
Only recently, Trump was hinting that being the leader of the free world wasn’t all it was cracked up to be and now this happens.
The people of New York need to take a long hard look at themselves. Anyone would think that the only way that they’d want Trump to take another bite of the Big Apple would be if he instantly choked on it and they got to watch.

Picking up on the same theme, Farage tweeted: “A giant deceit has been voted for today. Macron will be Juncker’s puppet.”
As well as praising Le Pen in recent weeks, Farage declared in a TV interview on Sunday morning that the 48-year-old had “lost weight” and was “looking pretty fit”. 
Katie Hopkins tweeted a picture of the pair and the caption: “Macron’s wife has promised him a special new toy from the shops tomorrow for being such a clever little boy.”
Echoing a line used by Le Pen in a televised debate with Macron on Thursday, Simon Richards, the CEO of the libertarian group the Freedom Association, said: “Macron evidently likes older women, so he’ll make an excellent lapdog for Angela Merkel.”

What is it about Italian coaches? Certainly, Serie A offers them the comprehensive grounding. Paul Pogba, the Manchester United midfielder, who spent four seasons at Juventus, described Italy’s top division as “the university of football, especially at a tactical level”. Then, there is Coverciano, the Italian Football Federation’s acclaimed technical centre and finishing school for managers.
“There is a good school in Italy but, honestly, when you arrive in England and you face this league, you must change your mind on a lot of things,” Conte says. “You must adapt very well and very quickly to this league. It is very difficult, very strong and it’s totally different to the Italian or Spanish leagues.
“In every single game, you must fight a lot. You must put all of yourself into every game and if you think you’re playing a team at a medium level you’re actually preparing for a defeat. For this reason it’s not easy [for an English team] to reach the end of a European competition. Also, for the national team, it’s very difficult to do very well in the World Cup or the Euros because you arrive at the end of the season and the players are tired.”
That is for the summer. For now, Conte is consumed by Middlesbrough and the final title push. It stands to lead him into elite company. “For sure, I looked at the past in England and I saw many Italian managers had won the title,” he says. “It’s great for our school and it’s logical to be proud, no? Last season, I supported Claudio Ranieri a lot to win the title and in Italy we celebrated this win in a great way.”

It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened
But it’s Monday morning, he’s just woken up, and he’s in no mood to enter that headspace. When I remark that the album has more darkness and meditations on mortality, he yawns and says, “Maybe, I dunno. Maybe I was just being a jackass.” Has he picked up any adult life skills recently? “Uh I don’t think I have very many… fuck. Ummm. I learned how to wipe my own ass last week,” he guffaws (the joke is later reprised several times). His preferred way of starting an answer is “I dunno”.
Two sides coexist in the DeMarco universe: one laid-back and sunny, one more introspective. A casual listen to the album doesn’t immediately reveal the ruminations within: the music sounds upbeat and melodic, there are odes to love (inspired by his long-term girlfriend), guitars twang serenely. Yet, DeMarco’s father looms large throughout. In opener My Old Man, DeMarco sings about becoming more like his father – “Uh-oh, looks like I’m seeing more of my old man in me” – a relatable-enough sentiment, made more touching by the knowledge that his father is an alcoholic and an addict whom he hardly knows.
Nevertheless, he warns against taking this too literally. “Anytime I see myself becoming something that I don’t necessarily agree with, that’s kind of what I’m talking about there, I guess,” he says. “But that can be taken in several different ways. Take it like a trope or whatever. It doesn’t matter – it’s a pop song.”
The album was written months ago, when his father had become very ill: the last song goes: “The thought of him no longer being around / Well sure it would be sad but not really different / And even though we barely know each other / It still hurts watching him fade away.” Although his father’s health has now improved, the two are still not in touch. Did exploring these issues on the album change the way he views his father? “Um, no. I mean, I was trying to understand it. But I don’t know, I really don’t. It just solidified [the fact] that I don’t understand.”
A much happier relationship is with his girlfriend, Kiera McNally. They met aged 14, got together five years later, and are still together seven years on (“almost eight”, she chirps in the background). The album’s love songs are varied – some are about past fights (“I never meant to make her cry”), some about fluctuations of affection (“sometimes my heart may seem awful cold”), one harks back to the feeling of “seeing her for the first time”, others are inspired by emotions from the distant past.
Considering that a lot of music is about break-ups or falling in love, is it harder to find inspiration in a contented, settled relationship? “It still comes,” he says. “I think that just being in love – being out of love, being in love, being confused by love, wanting love, not wanting love, being scared of love – it doesn’t matter which. There are so many things better than feeling nothing at all. Long-term relationships are like a fucking mountainscape, you know? Things go up, things go down. That’s the fun of it.” What’s his top relationship advice? “Be kind. Be respectful. And be real.”
DeMarco has always railed against the “cool guy fantasy” of rock stars being separate from fans: “the idea of that sexy guy in the band, dark and tall and handsome, looking at his shoes like, ‘Don’t talk to me’ – that has been so unappealing to me for ever.” Most of the fans he encounters are excitable young kids, with the occasional surprise. “It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened a couple times.”
But he also likes to throw curveballs about his life into the mix: he told one interviewer that Kiera has sadly passed away; he informed an audience they had broken up. Recently he said in an interview that he had become a father, prompting family members to get in touch to congratulate him; his mother said it almost gave her a heart attack. “The whole thing with the internet,” he says with a groan, “it’s the wild west. People read into things too much – it’s all horseshit and I like to treat it that way and have fun with it.”
I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth – it’s so twisted
He’s unlikely to repeat the experiment in his new place. He has just bought his first house, which made him feel “kind of weird and old”, after moving from New York to Los Angeles last August (“No real reason why – it just seemed a happening place, so it was like, ‘let’s go give it a shot’”). Now that he’s in LA, has he started to see the appeal of yoga and juice cleanses? “Nah, I don’t think so. I don’t like a juice, I like a smoothie, I like the chunkiness – a smoothie is halfway to a milkshake, and I’d have milkshakes every day if I could.”
It isn’t easy to get a strong opinion out of DeMarco, prime purveyor of contemporary slacker rock (in terms of sound rather than work ethic). What makes him angry? “I don’t get genuinely angry very easily. I don’t know. A whole number of different things. It’s hard to pinpoint what.” I try to stir him up a little. What does he think of life under Trump? “A lot of people are really put out, sad, disappointed… but I dunno. It’s not that it’s not my place to talk about American politics, but it’s a little complicated.” How worried is he about nuclear war? “If we got nuked I’d probably be fried before I even noticed it, which would suck, but would I know? Hopefully nuclear war doesn’t happen, that would really blow ass.”
How does he feel about social media? “It’s bizarre, but I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth. Kids have been led to believe that the number of likes you get on a post or something is equal to your popularity or how cool you are – it’s so twisted and evil. It’s really fucked up and scary, and it’s getting scarier.” He does have Twitter and Instagram accounts but rarely touches them; one of his most recent tweets, from last October, simply reads “#jarjarbinks”.
Social media has also meant that footage of his wilder live shows – nudity, drinking, a notorious incident involving a drumstick – live on online. “When those kinds of things happen it’s usually because I’ve had an off show,” he says. “What I try to focus on is try and play as well as I can and make sure everybody’s happy.”
Until then, does he have any pearls of wisdom to impart? “Nah, I’m good,” he says. “Just tell everybody to brush their teeth twice a day – keep it fresh.”
Mac DeMarco’s album This Old Dog is out now on Captured Tracks. He plays two sold-out nights at the O2 Academy Brixton, London SW9, on 30 and 31 May

The author also said Donald Trump “sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m”.
“Trump was strutting up and down, talking to his new members about how they were part of the greatest club in North Carolina,” Dodson said. “And when I first met him, I asked him … you know, this is the journalist in me … I said, ‘What are you using to pay for these courses?’ And he just sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m.”
Eric Trump, the president’s younger son who is now executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, was also present.
Dodson continued: “So when I got in the cart with Eric, as we were setting off [to play], I said, ‘Eric, who’s funding? I know no banks – because of the recession, the great recession – have touched a golf course. You know, no one’s funding any kind of golf construction. It’s dead in the water the last four or five years.’ 
He said, ‘Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia'
“Now that was three years ago, so it was pretty interesting.”
He also said: “And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”
Dodson, meanwhile, recounted a meal of cheeseburgers and being enveloped in a “bro hug” by Trump, and said: “You know, I liked the guy. I liked him. I mean, he was somebody you’d like to play golf with.”
“And I told Arnold that the next night at dinner and he laughed and said, ‘Really, Shakespeare? It’s more like this.’ And he crossed his hands and put them at his own throat.”

The three-time Olympian, three-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champion was 37.
“The only reason why the USA is in any conversation in the sport of bobsled is because of Steve Holcomb,” said US bobsled pilot Nick Cunningham, who roomed next to Holcomb in Lake Placid. “He was the face of our team. He was the face of our sport. We all emulated him. Every driver in the world watched him, because he was that good at what he did. It’s a huge loss, huge loss, not just for our team but for the entire bobsled community.”
No cause of death was immediately announced, but officials said there were no indications of foul play after the preliminary parts of an ongoing investigation were completed. USA Bobsled and Skeleton said it was believed Holcomb died in his sleep.
An autopsy was scheduled for Sunday. Funeral arrangements are expected to be finalized in the coming days.
“USA Bobsled and Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend,” federation CEO Darrin Steele said.
Holcomb was a native of Park City, Utah, and his signature moment came at the 2010 Vancouver games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold medal drought for the US in bobsled’s signature race.
“The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb,” US Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said. “Steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, and his perseverance and achievements were an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve’s family and the entire bobsledding community.”
Holcomb was still one of the world’s elite drivers, finishing second on the World Cup circuit in two-man points and third in four-man points this past season.
The final victory of his career was last December in Lake Placid. He won 60 World Cup medals in his career, 10 more at the world championships and three in the Olympics, making him one of the most decorated pilots in the world.
“You will be loved, missed and remembered forever,” US women’s pilot Jamie Greubel Poser wrote on Twitter.
Holcomb was an Eagle Scout and served as both a member of the Utah Army National Guard and the Army World Class Athlete Program. He was cherubic, almost always happy in public, someone whose sense of humor was well-known throughout the close-knit bobsled world. Teammates even spent a season chronicling his “Holcy Dance,” a little less-than-rhythmic shuffle that he would do at each stop on the World Cup circuit to make fellow sliders laugh.
But there was also a troubled side, including battles with depression and alcohol, plus a failed hotel-room suicide attempt involving sleeping pills in 2007 which he wrote about in his autobiography, But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold.
“After going through all that and still being here, I realized what my purpose was,” Holcomb said in a 2014 interview.
Winning gold with push athletes Steve Mesler, Curt Tomasevicz and Justin Olsen at the Vancouver Olympics turned Holcomb into a full-fledged star. In the months that followed, Holcomb met President Barack Obama, played golf with Charles Barkley, hung out with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Cleveland Indians game and went to the Indianapolis 500.
In the bobsled world, he was larger than life. “We’re all still in shock,” Cunningham said. “I don’t know if mourning will happen for a long time, because the shock part will take a while.”

Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.

Live streaming is becoming big business, with millions of people around the world broadcasting the minutiae of their daily lives in real time to adoring fans - and making small fortunes in the process. But is it safe?
Samantha Firth, a 21-year-old nanny living in Chicago, walks to the subway with her friend. So far, so ordinary.
But she is simultaneously broadcasting her 15-minute journey live via her mobile to thousands of avid followers.
"You guys are lit," she says excitedly as she looks at the stream of rolling messages and emojis that are popping up on her screen from her fans. 
"I love you... you guys are the best," she exclaims, before heading onto the subway and zooming the camera in on a spot on her forehead.
It used to be that only film stars would be famous, but thanks to reality TV, YouTube and bloggers, anyone can have their "fifteen minutes" of fame, as Andy Warhol predicted.
The proliferation of live broadcasting tools, pioneered by Meerkat several years ago and followed by the likes of Periscope, Facebook, YouTube and others, has given many young people the chance to broadcast every aspect of their lives - whether they're brushing their hair in their bedroom or out dancing with friends.
In China alone, the entertainment live streaming market is valued at £5bn, according to Credit Suisse. 
And in the US, 63% of 18-34 year-olds are watching live content and 42% creating it, finds a study by UBS Evidence Lab. 
But for many like Ms Firth, this isn't just narcissistic fun, it's a cash cow.
She joined Live.me - owned by China's Cheetah Mobile - eight months ago after moving from Sydney to Chicago. The live-in nanny has since become one of the most popular broadcasters on the site, amassing 350,000 fans. 
These devotees bombard her with virtual gifts - animated stickers that can be converted into "diamonds" and then real money - helping her pull in about $21,000 (£16,300) a month.
"Coming from a different country it has been difficult to make friends, but this app has allowed me to connect with people who have the same interests," she says of her reasons for joining. 
"I spend most of my free time broadcasting because it's where most of my friends are." 
She is keen to portray a candid version of herself, pimples and all. 
"I don't wear make-up, I wear sweatshirts and sweatpants," she says. "Sometimes I cry when someone says something hurtful on a broadcast."
Like Live.me, live streaming platform YouNow enables these citizen broadcasters to make money from fans sending them virtual gifts. Fans of some streaming sites can also subscribe monthly to their favourite live streamers.
It's been a real moneyspinner for the top broadcasters, who can earn up to $200,000 (£155,000) a year. 
Singer Emma McGann, 26, broadcasts live from her studio in Coventry, England, for three to six hours every day. She says her live streams attract about 5-10,000 unique views. 
YouNow not only provides her with a good salary - she earns £2,000-3,000 a month via the channel - but it has helped her gain exposure for her music. 
"It enabled me to get a single in the iTunes chart," she says. "It's also a great testing ground for new material." 
"I like the live element. I like to interact with the audience and take song requests."
Fans can also speak to her over the internet.
While many brands are already running their own live streaming sessions, We Are Social head of strategy Harvey Cossell believes there are opportunities for brands to capitalise on live streaming by co-creating with individuals who have already amassed a loyal audience.
The success of such collaborations in the social gaming world, on sites such as Twitch, are a case in point.
"They would need to identify those people that represent a similar set of values to the brand in question and then find creative ways to partner with them in the production of their content," he advises. 
The challenge, he warns, is one of authenticity. 
"It's always better for brands either to partner with the right person, or do nothing at all."
But for all its engagement value and monetisation potential, you only have to search online to see that live streaming has its dark side. 
"Live streaming apps and sites can expose young people to graphic and distressing content and can leave them vulnerable to bullying and online harassment," an NSPCC [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children] spokesman tells the BBC.
"Worryingly, live chat can also be used by groomers to target young people who may be manipulated into sending sexual images and videos."
Khudor Annous, head of marketing and partnerships at Live.me, says the company has a number of safeguards, including a facial recognition tool that can supposedly spot anyone who's under the age of 13 on the app. 
"If they are in fact under the age of 13, then we ban the account," says Mr Annous.
"We have also provided users with reporting tools to report a channel if they identify a child in the app. We're typically able to evaluate reports within a couple of hours depending on daily volume."
As for grooming, he says: "Every user has the ability to report any suspicious behaviour before, or any violations of our community guidelines. We also work with the FBI and local law enforcement agencies around the globe to ensure the safety of our community."
But there are also concerns that the broadcasters are themselves exploiting young people. 
Clinical psychologist Linda Blair describes the rise of young people live streaming as "very sad". 
She adds: "It's an indication of loneliness. They might temporarily feel great but it's only a distraction."
But with millions of people already using live streaming platforms, including Facebook Live, we can expect the number of everyday broadcasters to continue growing. 
"I see live streaming following a path similar to social networking, where at first it started as a place for people to connect with each other but eventually evolved into a powerful platform for advertising, marketing, and publishing," says Paul Verna, principal analyst at eMarketer.
Mr Cossell also believes that live video will expand into other formats.
"It will begin to harness emerging technologies such as 360-video and virtual reality more readily," he says.
"Live streaming is clearly here to stay."

The ancient adage was never wrong, and thanks to Fox News we can now offer an update: to lose one may be considered a misfortune; to lose two is a sign something's up; but to lose three is a sign that something is rotten in America's most watched news network.
The sacking of ratings juggernaut Bill O'Reilly last month was the most significant departure in the modern history of American cable news. Except that is, for the departure of his boss Roger Ailes last year. 
These two monumental media events - the first, a dismissal of the biggest talent on America's most influential news service; the second, a dismissal of the most influential man in American news media (after his boss, Rupert Murdoch) - have now been followed by another remarkable departure: that of Bill Shine, who ran Fox News with Ailes for two decades, and was appointed co-president to sort the mess out. 
Three huge departures within nine months. There is now chatter that Sean Hannity, the senior anchor who tweeted last week that Fox News would be finished without Shine, could be the next to go. 
What is going on? And could this affect UK communications regulator Ofcom's forthcoming judgement on whether to reject the Murdoch family's bid for the 61% of broadcaster Sky they don't own? 
That is certainly the hope of the cross-party group of MPs who have been lobbying Ofcom, and who would rather not see the Murdochs consolidate their power here in the UK. Interestingly, former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said on BBC Radio 4's World at One that Ofcom told him they were in listening mode. And there is certainly a lot of noise emanating from Fox News HQ in Manhattan right now.
There is a palpable fear in New York that the sexual harassment scandal which has toppled Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly could be an American version of the phone hacking scandal that dogged Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers. The echoes are eerie. 
First, there is the instinctive blame on one rogue individual. Fox insiders have generally blamed the dominant, strongman personality of Roger Ailes for what went wrong, saying that with his departure the culture would improve. This sounds familiar to those who remember the initial claim that phone hacking was conducted by "one rogue reporter". 
Second, there are the wider questions about a corporate culture. I don't mean by this whether or not Fox News leans to the right. I mean whether or not it is well run. Shine, who we're told resigned over the weekend, wasn't accused of sexual or racial harassment himself; but he was accused by multiple individuals of knowing plenty about the behaviour of his boss, and failing to act appropriately. 
Third, and related, there are the legal investigations now under way: not one, but two. The bigger one is a federal probe looking at whether or not Fox withheld settlement payments over sexual harassment from investors. 
And fourth, and worst of all for the Murdochs, there is the time. The phone hacking scandal derailed their last attempt to acquire the part of Sky which they don't already own. Now, with Ofcom's assessment of their latest takeover bid in the long grass until after the UK general election on 8 June, this huge scandal threatens to generate all the wrong headlines. The timing couldn't be worse.
For all that, it is important to note that Fox's ratings haven't suffered, and the advertising boycott that followed the revelations around O'Reilly - who strenuously denies he's done anything wrong, and is now forging a fresh career as a podcaster - hasn't yet dented Fox revenues in a really significant way. 
Moreover, Fox has moved swiftly and decisively in removing toxic individuals, in a way that shows they are extremely alert to potential reputational and commercial damage. It really was unimaginable this time last year that Fox News could exist without Ailes, let alone O'Reilly and even Megyn Kelly, who is probably America's most sought after female anchor, and left the network a few months ago.
The dominant narrative in American media is that these moves show Rupert's sons, James and Lachlan, imposing their worldview on their father's media giant by decisively rejecting the orthodoxies of his reign. 
In conversations with seasoned observers of Planet Murdoch, individuals at 21st Century Fox, and opponents of that company's bid for the 61% of Sky it doesn't already own, that narrative finds plenty of support. 
That both Ailes and O'Reilly have gone does give credence to the idea that Fox News is being reconfigured by its parent company, 21st Century Fox, where Executive Chairman Lachlan, and CEO James - who are of equal status - want change. Since they acquired this joint status in June 2015, these two have made a concerted effort to modernise their father's firm.
They have held regular town hall meetings with staff, extended parental leave, and made a habit of sending memos to staff - whether groups or individuals - saying well done: a pillar of right-on modern management. 
More importantly, they have appointed several women to key roles, from Stacey Snider (in charge of 20th Century Fox film studio) to Courteney Monroe (CEO of National Geographic, a particular passion for James). The entertainment division of 21st Century Fox has several women in key executive roles, from Elizabeth Gabler and Nancy Utley to Emma Watts and Vanessa Morrison.
Fox insiders are frustrated that the strides made in equality in the entertainment division garner much less publicity than the misdeeds of senior men in the (much smaller and less profitable) news division.
With commercial titans like Chase Carey, Peter Chernin, and now Ailes out of the picture, and James and Lachlan in the ascendant, there is a sense of a new broom at the company.
But Rupert still rules the roost. I would urge caution on those who argue that his grip is weakening. Not only was he, as you'd expect, ultimately responsible for the decisions to remove Ailes, Shine and O'Reilly; not only did he install himself as the temporary but very hands-on chairman of Fox News after Ailes left; but the idea that there was a battle of wills between father and sons, who outnumbered and outfoxed their father, is fanciful.
It is worth bearing in mind how much Rupert would have hated the New York Times felling of O'Reilly. It was their brilliant investigation that revealed the payments made to complainants against O'Reilly, causing a boycott by dozens of advertisers. Murdoch senior coveted the Grey Lady for many years, and paid a huge price for the Wall Street Journal partly because he was so determined to get one over it. The New York Times is the very embodiment of the liberal coastal elite O'Reilly, Shine and Ailes have spent decades bashing. The irony is not lost on either party.
What next for Fox News? Hannity's future remains unclear. Former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who works for Fox News, told me a fortnight ago that Tucker Carlson, the anchor who has replaced O'Reilly in the key 8pm slot, has long been thought of as his likely successor. In his first few days, Carlson has rated well. 
But the bigger drama is yet to come: the federal probes into whether payments were withheld from investors could intensify just as Ofcom consider whether to approve the Murdochs' bid for Sky. The last bid was of course derailed by the phone hacking scandal; and while Ofcom won't comment on what is a quasi-judicial process, their deliberations aren't taking place in a vacuum.
In ancient times, before Donald Trump was elected and when some people naively believed Hillary Clinton would be US president, the mood music coming out of New York suggested that the sons would build Fox News around Megyn Kelly, taking it in a more centrist and female-friendly direction. Now she's gone, and Rupert Murdoch is trying to rid his network of the cancer threatening to spread through it. 
Suddenly, the future of Fox News is up for grabs - and British regulators are watching.

On the night of 29 September 1994, seven-year-old Nicholas Green was fatally shot during a family holiday in southern Italy. The death was a tragedy for his parents, Reg and Maggie, but their decision to donate his organs caused organ donation rates in Italy to triple in a decade - a result dubbed the "Nicholas effect". 
"The first time I sensed danger was when a dark car came up close behind us and stayed there for a few moments," says Reg Green, who is remembering the night his son was inexplicably shot by strangers in southern Italy. "Shortly after, this car began to overtake. I relaxed, thinking there was nothing wrong after all."
But, instead of overtaking, the car drew alongside. Reg and Maggie heard loud angry cries. They assumed that the men inside wanted them to stop.
"I thought if we did stop we would be completely at their mercy. So instead I accelerated. They did too, so the two cars raced alongside each other through the night. A bullet shattered the back window. Maggie turned around and both the children appeared to be fast asleep."
In fact, Nicholas had been shot in the head although his sister Eleanor was sleeping peacefully. Seconds later, the driver's window was blown in too and the other car drove off. 
"I stopped the car and got out. The interior light came on but Nicholas didn't move. I looked closer and saw his tongue was sticking out slightly and there was a trace of vomit on his chin," says Green, 88, whose book about the experience, The Nicholas Effect, formed the basis for the 1998 film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Alan Bates, Nicholas' Gift. 
"For the first time we realised something terrible had happened. The shock of seeing him like that was the bleakest moment I've ever had."
An American family's holiday had turned into a nightmare. Nicholas died in hospital days later, after entering a coma. But before he did, his parents made a decision which would change the lives of seven families across Italy - they decided to donate his organs. 
"At that point, these people were just abstractions. You had no idea what kind of people they were. It was like giving money to charity but you've no idea how it helps. Four months afterwards, we were invited to go back and meet them all in Sicily, where four of the recipients are from," says Green.
Criminals in Italy rarely kill children, Green says, because it makes the police so determined to catch the killers. This is what happened in Nicholas's case. A no-holds-barred police investigation resulted in the arrest and conviction of two men, Francesco Mesiano and Michele Iannello.
It's still unclear whether the men were robbers, or hitmen who attacked the wrong car in a case of mistaken identity, but the fact that one of them employs one of Italy's top lawyers suggests to Green that they have mafia connections.
"The killing of a seven-year-old American boy in a country where violent death is commonplace has plunged Italy into national soul-searching," the Times reported. Green says that the idea of an innocent child being shot while on holiday in the country made many Italians feel ashamed - and led them to embrace the idea of organ donation as a way of making amends.
"The work we have done to remind them of how much good could come out of this has had this quite astonishing effect which we couldn't possibly have foreseen. A country that was almost at the bottom for organ donation in Europe could immediately move almost to the top. No other country has tripled organ donation."
In 1993, the year before Nicholas was shot, 6.2 people per million donated an organ, while by 2006 the figure had reached 20 per million. During that period, in 1999, Italy moved to an opt-out system, where when someone dies it is presumed they are willing for their organs to be donated unless they have specified otherwise. 
France, Greece, Portugal and Spain also use an opt-out system, while the US and UK (with the exception of Wales) continue to operate an opt-in system.
In Italy, there are more than 120 places named in Nicholas's honour:
"Nicholas was a kindly boy who always looked for the best in things so, when you were with him, you always wanted to be your best," explains his father.
"I know that at seven years old he probably wouldn't have been able to comprehend but, I know, as he grew up this is just what he would have wanted us to do - there's no doubt about that.
"If the choice was between being angry at the people who did it and wanting to help somebody else as the first priority, he would have undoubtedly chosen helping somebody out."
Green, who worked as a journalist on Fleet Street for many years before moving to the US, says his son taught him a lot about tolerance. "I'm impatient and when things go wrong, I get het up about it," he says. "Nicholas had a calmness about it all and a forgivingness that made you want to be the same."
Nothing could have prepared Green for the moment he came face-to-face with those people whose lives were saved by Nicholas's organs.
"When the doors opened and the six walked in, the effect was overwhelming," he says, noting that illness prevented one from being present. "Some were smiling, some were tearful, others were bashful but they were all alive. Most of these people had been on the point of death. That's when it hit you for the first time, just how big a thing this was. 
"There was also a sense of how the parents and grandparents would have been devastated. You got the feeling there were many more people involved whose lives would have been much poorer if we hadn't saved them."
Green and his wife Maggie, who married in April 1986, were keen to ensure that Eleanor did not grow up alone. They have since had twins, Laura and Martin, who will turn 21 in May.  What impact has the death of Green's son had on his life? "There's a sadness that was never there before. I'm never completely happy any more," Green says. "Even when I'm at my happiest, I think: 'Wouldn't it be better if Nicholas was here?'"
Green returns to Italy twice a year to raise awareness about organ donation. On his most recent visit he met Maria Pia Pedala, who had been in a coma from liver failure on the day Nicholas died, but quickly bounced back to health after receiving his liver. She married two years later, and two years after that gave birth to a baby boy - named Nicholas - who was followed in two years by a girl, Alessia. The three of them travelled from Sicily, where organ donation was almost unknown in 1994 Green says, to take part with him in a television programme in Milan.
Green points out that even the recipient of Nicholas's heart, Andrea Mongiardo, who died earlier this year, had the organ three times longer than Nicholas himself did.
But he sees his son's legacy extending far beyond the seven people who received Nicholas's organs. Because donation rates soared after Nicholas's death, he says, thousands of people are now alive who would otherwise have died.

The chief executive of the world's second largest investment bank has warned that London "will stall" because of the risks from the Brexit process.
Lloyd Blankfein said that his firm, Goldman Sachs, which employs 6,500 people in the UK, had "contingency plans" to move people depending on the outcome of the negotiations.
Mr Blankfein said he hoped the bank would not have to trigger the plans.
He wants to keep as much of its activities in the UK as possible.
In an interview with the BBC, Mr Blankfein revealed the firm had held discussions with different cities across Europe and had looked at increasing office space in a number of locations, thought to include Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany, and Dublin.
Mr Blankfein said both sides in the Brexit negotiations were playing for very high economic stakes and that there would need to be an implementation period of at least "a couple of years" once the exit deal had been agreed by the spring of 2019.
If there was not, banks like Goldman would have to act "prematurely" and possibly move jobs and activities.
"We are talking about the long-term stability of huge economies with hundreds of millions of people and livelihoods at stake and huge gross domestic product," he told me.
"So, if it takes a little while - I'd rather get it right than do things quickly."
I asked him if the expansion of London as a financial capital over the last three decades would go into reverse because of the Brexit process.
"I don't think it will totally reverse," he told me.
"It will stall, it might backtrack a bit, it just depends on a lot of things about which we are uncertain and I know there isn't certainty at the moment."
More than one million people work in the financial services sector in the UK and it pays over £70bn a year in taxes to the government, 11.5% of all receipts.
The fear from many in the City is that if there is a poor deal with the EU, many of those jobs will move on to the continent.
The head of Goldman Sachs Europe, Richard Gnodde, has already suggested that Goldman is looking to increase its presence on the European continent by "hundreds" of people, although the bank has not said yet whether jobs will be lost in the UK.
I asked Mr Blankfein directly if jobs would move out of the capital.
"We don't have big plans now, we are looking - we are trying to avoid," he answered.
Mr Blankfein said there was a risk of banks having a "smaller footprint" in Britain.
"Obviously, a lot of people elect to have their European business concentrated in a single place, and the easiest place, certainly, for the biggest economy in the world [America] to concentrate would be the UK - the culture, the language, the special relationship, and we are an example of that," he said.
"The UK has a big history - certainly in financial services - of managing markets and having a fair system that makes it very attractive, but it extends to other industries as well.
"And if you cannot benefit from access to the EU from the UK - and nobody knows what those rules and determinations will be - then the risk is there will be some adjustment that will cause some people to have a smaller footprint in the UK."
Mr Blankfein said he wanted to see as few barriers as possible to financial services being traded between Britain and the rest of the EU.
The prime minister has said that the UK will leave the single market but has argued she wants a comprehensive trade deal to replace the present access arrangements.
Labour has said it would scrap Mrs May's Brexit plan, outlined in a White Paper in February, and keep access to the single market "on the table".
But with incendiary language from both sides in the negotiations - the UK government and the rest of the EU - many fear that a new free trade deal will be very difficult to negotiate.
The EU has also made it clear that any deal will not be as economically advantageous to Britain as being a full member of the bloc. 
Mr Blankfein - who said he understood the negotiations weren't "being done for our comfort or convenience" - warned that the safety and security of the financial system was also important and that any rapid changes and fragmentation would put that at risk.
He said that basing most of a bank's activities in one place was "sounder" and more efficient and that in 10 years' time it was still very likely that London would be its largest EU office by a substantial margin.
"I would say that it is our hope that we will be able to conduct our business as close as we can to the way we conduct it today," Mr Blankfein said.
"That is, we could have German nationals marketing German securities to German investors from the UK.
"And be resident in the UK and accomplish that.
"I would like and it is my hope that we can do as much of that as possible.
"I think it is in the best interests of the UK, the best interests of Germany, to have London - which has a lot of experience about regulating these markets - continue close to that model."
Goldman, which has faced billions of dollars-worth of fines over its behaviour in the run up to the financial crisis, is one of the world's most successful international banks.
It is second only to JP Morgan, also American, in the league table of investment banks.
If it were to decide to relocate significant parts of its business to the continent, it would be taken as a signal about the attractiveness of London as a place to do business.
"Without knowing how things will turn out we have to plan for a number of contingencies," Mr Blankfein said about possible job losses.
"And our hope is we don't have to implement anything until we know what we have to implement. 
"But if there is no period of time to implement whatever changes are brought about in a negotiation, we may have to do things prematurely and we may have to do a range of things as a precaution and take steps."
Mr Blankfein added: "But right now we are trying to avoid that and so our advice and our interests would be benefitted not by one outcome versus another - although clearly we would like to stay close to where we are today - but what we are really looking for at this moment, the finest point we can make, is a long enough implementation period so we can begin the process of adjustment after we know what we are adjusting to."
Referring to the language used by both sides this week - Theresa May said some in the EU were trying to interfere in the general election by attacking Britain's position - Mr Blankfein said: "A couple of years is a long time for people to calm down and really take stock of what their long term economic interests are.
"And in the UK it is to try and have a very good relationship with a very big trading bloc, and for the European market to recognise what a big economy the UK is."

The 2016 poll of nearly 8,000 Britons found just under 60% had had a drink in the past week - the lowest rate since the survey began in 2005. 
Of those who had not had a drink, half were teetotallers.
One of the problems with the ONS survey is that it is based on people's own recollections - and it is well known that we are terrible for underestimating our drinking. 
But there is evidence to be found elsewhere that the fall in alcohol consumption is real.
The findings chime with a much longer running source - the British Beer and Pub Association's data on the sales of pure alcohol.
It shows in the early 1950s alcohol consumption per head was below four litres of pure alcohol a year - the equivalent of about 140 pints of beer.
In the following decades, that climbed, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. 
By 2004, it had peaked, topping 9.5 litres.
Since then though, it has fallen and is now back under eight litres.
There are a variety of reasons that have been put forward for this trend - and to understand them you need to look at who is drinking and who is not.
And this is where the ONS data is particularly useful. 
Perhaps surprisingly, young people are not the biggest drinkers - in fact, they are among the age groups least likely to have consumed alcohol in the past week. 
Fewer than half of people aged 16 to 24 had had a drink, compared with nearly two-thirds of those aged 45 to 64.
Various reasons have been put forward for this - from the recession, changes in technology and globalisation making the work place more competitive for young people to the rise of social media allowing online socialising rather than meeting for a quick drink in the pub.
Immigration is also likely to be a factor - drinking rates tend to be lower in areas with high levels of ethnic diversity.
But that, of course, suggests problem drinking is still a problem among certain age groups. 
A major part of the increase in drinking from the 1960s onwards has been driven by the rise in boozing at home - twice as much alcohol is now bought from shops than is purchased in bars, pubs and restaurants. 
This form of alcohol consumption is more common in the older age groups and explains why the most frequent drinkers are the middle-aged, particularly those among high income groups.
Drinkers earning £40,000 or more are 50% more likely to have drunk in the past week, compared with those on £10,000 to £15,000. 
A common justification put forward is that these people are drinking responsibly. 
That is certainly true in terms of anti-social behaviour, but the evidence is pretty damning when it comes to their own health. 
A third of the men aged 45 to 64 and a quarter of the women had been binge drinking in the past week, the ONS survey showed.
Dr Tony Rao, co-chairman of the older people's substance misuse working group at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, believes these figures should act as a "wake-up call" to the drinking habits of the baby boomers.
He points out that problem drinking in older age groups is a real threat, with alcohol-related hospital admissions and mental health problems on the rise.
He says: "Alcohol abuse is not a young person problem. 
"It is a problem in older age groups, and that's not going to go away."

Unearthing an original That’s All Right record became a £4,000 lucky strike; a set of five original Sun singles at one time fetched £25,000. This made them a sort of pension for many collectors. They packed items away, hoping one day to exchange them for a caravan in the Dordogne. However, this has all begun to change.
There are about 32,000 Elvis records being sold on eBay at the moment – this number was closer to 20,000 items for all memorabilia five years ago. And it’s not even as if they are selling well. Of the 40,000 vinyl listings to finish in the past three months, only 16,000 have resulted in a sale. The problem is, there simply aren’t enough collectors left. “You’ll barely see Elvis guys here, not any more,” I’m told by Alan Simpson, an Elvis dealer at Stratford-upon-Avon record fair, as he stands over a vacant stall.
Hargreaves, who is now retired after founding the Hargreaves Lansdown financial services company, said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of EU nationals before the delicate negotiations over Brexit. However, he said, May should simply “make the gesture” and not wait until Brussels agreed to do the same for UK nationals living in EU states.
It coincides with concern among some senior Brexit backers over May’s approach to immigration after Brexit.
Hargreaves said he was happy to see EU nationals already here maintain their current rights. “Most of those are in work and adding to our economy,” he said. “We are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future, but I think there should have been that comfort given, because they came under different circumstances.”
Wolfson said: “While it is important and essential that Britain controls who comes into this country, and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers … it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge.
“We are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war. If we are too draconian on immigration, it will have two adverse effects on our economy. The first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth, and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world.
“The most important thing to come out of Brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world – that Britain is an open country, a free trading country, one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it.”
Marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures, arguing that universities “must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post-Brexit economy”.
“It is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no-brainer to take students out of the migration numbers,” he said.
“Polling of Brexit voters even shows strong support for this change. People in the north and Midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector. They are simply not worried about student migration.”
One video uploaded earlier this month showed Heather spraying disappearing ink on the floor of the bedroom of youngest child, Cody. The Martins scream at him: “What the fuck did you do?” as Cody breaks down in tears, thinking he’s in trouble, and maintains he didn’t do anything. His parents reveal the whole thing is a joke. “It’s just a prank, brah,” Martin tells him, still filming.
The Martins’ response was initially defiant. They posted a video defending their content and prompted their children to do the same. But later they backtracked, declaring the videos to be fake and scripted, and issued an apology.
Last Monday, the controversy reached a new level after Rose Hall, the biological mother of Mike Martin’s youngest children, Cody and Emma, said she had been granted emergency custody of them.
In a YouTube video uploaded by her lawyer, Tim Conlon, she said: “Emma and Cody are with me, I have emergency custody – they’re doing good. They’re getting back to their playful selves.”
YouTube didn’t have a specific comment on the DaddyOFive case, but it confirmed that ads were removed from the channel.
Tony Blockley, a criminologist at the University of Derby, sees people’s obsession with YouTube pranks as part and parcel of a society that increasingly lives its life online, but also enjoys engaging in a particular kind of schadenfreude.
“We celebrate what people post online and we live our lives on social media,” he says. “And there’s this kind of voyeurism. There are people who like to see others at times of distress or coming to harm. “The question is,” he says, “is the problem with the person who creates the content, or the people who watch it?
“Absolutely, the creators have to take responsibility, but if nobody watched it, then nobody would make these videos. When people see they can get views, it becomes a competition to see who can get more, which leads to more extreme pranks.”
“Since the invention of the radio, we have assumed that independent bodies are needed to scrutinise the media – so why you should the largest video-sharing platform on the planet be exempt?” In DaddyOFive’s case, other YouTubers seem to have acted as their own form of regulation, ensuring the videos were brought to the authorities’ attention even when they were all made private.As yet, there has been no update on DaddyOFive’s social media channels, and the Martins’ lawyers have declined to comment. Further court hearings on permanent custody of the children are pending.
“If the police get involved, then it will be because of a statutory or legislative criminal act, or if someone reports it to them,” says Blockley. “But just because a crime hasn’t necessarily taken place, doesn’t mean it’s not harmful.”
“It was amazing how beautiful it was,” she told the Guardian on Saturday. “The silver airship against a clear blue sky. How enormous. It was the most exquisite thing I had ever seen.”
Then the zeppelin turned. Its tail swung into view. On it, stark and black, were swastikas.
Her neighbors, she said, gesticulated angrily at the sky.
Not long after, on 6 May 1937, as it was coming in to moor at the naval base at Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Hindenburg caught fire and crashed. Of the 97 people on board, 62 miraculously escaped the burning wreckage. But 22 crew members, 13 passengers and one worker on the ground were killed.
After the disaster, President Franklin Roosevelt and King George sent telegrams of condolence to Hitler.
The Hindenburg crash was the first major transport disaster captured on film, in dramatic footage ever since paired with recorded commentary by a radio reporter who reacted in horror to the shocking scene before him.
Few people directly connected to the disaster are still alive. The lone remaining survivor from the airship itself, Werner Doehner, is now an 88-year-old resident of Colorado.
“Suddenly the air was on fire,” he said this week, speaking to the Associated Press.
The Hindenburg was about 200ft off the ground when it combusted – not “exploded”, as some have since described it. It burned from tail to nose in just 34 seconds but as it collapsed to Earth, Doehner’s mother threw him and his 10-year-old brother from the craft. All three survived.
Just before the fire broke out, however, Werner’s father had gone to the family cabin.
“We didn’t see him again,” Doehner said.
His 14-year-old sister escaped the wreck but rushed back into it to look for their missing father. After emerging without him, she did not survive her burns.
Investigations, however, concluded that a spark of static electricity had most likely ignited leaking hydrogen as, in Zitarosa’s words, “they brought the ship in for landing under thunderstorm conditions”.
It is most widely believed that the leak came from one of the ship’s rear gas containers. What caused the leak is not known. Zitarosa surmised that a broken length of wiring or other piece of hardware somehow ripped the container, which was made of a tough cotton fabric with a film of early latex-type material.
Other factors may have contributed. The Hindenburg was 12 hours late to Lakehurst, having been delayed by strong headwinds across the north Atlantic before spending several hours flying around the area, waiting for storms to clear.
Zeppelins normally took two and a half days to reach the US from Germany, moving twice as fast as an ocean liner. Although the Hindenburg had taken three days, it had plenty of diesel fuel left. It could have flown further.
But passengers, among them dignitaries heading for England and the coronation of King George VI, were waiting. The airship was due to turn around in record time.
Its pilots attempted a so-called high landing, in which ropes were tossed to the ground from around 200ft, for ground crew to pull the giant craft down and secure it to a mooring mast.
Either way, it was known to be extremely dangerous to land in thundery weather. Ground crew members were soaked and there was electricity in the air.
“When the ship dropped its landing ropes, they got wet and acted as conductors,” said Zitarosa. “The ship became grounded and that’s why we think the static electricity made a spark and caught the leaking hydrogen.”
A Chicago radio reporter, Herbert Morrison, bore witness to the raging inferno.
“It burst into flames, it burst into flames!” he cried. “And it’s falling, it’s crashing …it’s crashing terrible … Oh, the humanity … oh, ladies and gentlemen …”
Zeppelins never landed at Lakehurst again. Before long, American dirigibles were taking off from there instead, searching for German submarines.
At least the ensuing war of words and public emotion shows that both sides realise just how much is at stake. The truth is that the upcoming negotiations will be incredibly complicated, for both technical and political reasons.
For example, how can we deal with the land border in Ireland? The new arrangements will have major implications for business and trade but also for the hundreds of thousands of people in the north with a passport from the republic. Nearly 20,000 workers commute across the border. These are not technical issues but questions with far-reaching political consequences, including for the peace process.
And Northern Ireland is only one of many such issues, where technical complexity meets political tension. Perhaps most important is the need to reach a deal that defines the rights of expats on both sides. But which rights should these migrants keep? A British citizen living in Spain currently has the right to vote in local elections. Should this be preserved? What about the French student who pays domestic rates at a London university? And how do we process the pension rights accrued by a Polish worker who spends six years in the UK but then leaves? The EU has mechanisms for these situations, and lives were planned around the existing rules.
Whatever the agreement on citizens’ rights, they must be enforceable and protected. So who will watch over them, and what will be the relevant jurisdiction? Theresa May talks of escaping oversight by the European court of justice (ECJ), while the EU wants the ECJ to adjudicate. All of these questions are technically fraught and politically charged, but both sides have repeatedly insisted that citizens’ rights are a priority. So now they must deliver. The UK and European public rightly expect politicians to sort out the mess and minimise the damage to people’s lives.
A second issue is future trade relationships. On a technical level, this should actually be easy to agree. We are not talking about a trade deal between two vastly different economies: on the contrary, the Great Repeal Act will translate the current body of EU law into British law. Thus, on the day of Brexit, standards and regulations will essentially be identical. The questions here are whether either side imposes tariffs, and how to deal with future regulatory divergence. These are standard topics, often negotiated in trade agreements, and they are less complex than the fine detail of migrant citizens’ lives.
With political will, a sensible trade agreement is in reach. A deal that primarily covers goods, rather than investment and services, could easily be passed on the EU side. More elaborate agreements would require unanimity, and the recent near-collapse of the EU-Canada Ceta agreement shows that this can be tricky to achieve. But still, it is in both sides’ interest to avoid a no-deal scenario and a fallback to WTO rules.
A final big issue is the infamous “Brexit bill”. Although economically insignificant, politically this might be the most toxic issue. It is important to understand that even a sum of €60bn would not be at all threatening to the UK’s economic fortunes – it is around 3% of UK GDP, and it would be spread over a number of years. But for politicians the bill is extremely explosive, mostly because of the emotional headlines it will trigger on both sides.
After Brexit, economic and political links between the EU and the UK will be weaker. But the UK will still be the EU’s closest neighbour and an important ally. It is time to discuss in earnest how to soften the damage of Brexit for citizens and business on both sides. And it is time to explore how to structure future cooperation in fighting terrorism. Brexit will not be a success, but aiming for failure serves no one. Goodwill and a sense of perspective are the way to protect the EU and UK alike.

When the engine stops, you get off, Osama told them.
Three uncomfortable days later, they lurched to a halt on the outskirts of Jalalabad, a city in the north-east of Afghanistan, next to a dun-coloured fort surrounded by 4m-high mud walls and crowned with guard towers. The fort was a barracks for the al-Qaida training camp located at a nearby village, and Osama had grandiosely named it Najm al-Jihad, the Star of the Holy War. Surrounded by adobe huts set into a lunar landscape, it was dubbed “Star Wars” by Osama’s third son, Saad. Discarded ammunition boxes, food packaging and empty bottles of chemicals lay everywhere. Khairiah, the family matriarch, organised a clean-up.
The women pinned up woollen rugs as insulation and plumped thin foam mattresses with old clothes, inspecting the bedding for scorpions and snakes. Narrow alleys that connected the apartments to a tin toilet outhouse were swilled out, and in the rudimentary kitchen area someone fixed the water pump and got an old generator running. The women would cook on a traditional Afghan bukhar (open stove); the three nursing mothers were to have the best pickings. Osama’s 14-year-old daughter Khadija had recently given birth. Two years earlier, she had been married in a double wedding with her 12-year-old half-sister Fatima. Their husbands, two Saudi brothers in their 30s who both had wives and children already, were mujahideen fighters. Saad bin Laden’s wife, Wafa, also had a baby, as did Osama’s youngest wife, Amal.
The children fought over a battered Nintendo or scanned their father’s transistor for snatches of Madonna
Without any adult male relatives to protect them, only al-Qaida guards who could not enter the same room, the wives had been instructed by Osama to blow themselves up if the situation became critical. Even nine-year-old Ladin had a role. He was to lie on his back, staring up into the sky, scouting for enemy jets, as war with America now appeared inevitable.
At night they huddled under a blanket with a Kalashnikov and a stash of grenades, wondering what would befall those friends and family left behind in the cities, and when they would next see their husband and sons.
***
But lately there had been dissonance. Many al-Qaida members had witnessed the screaming rows Osama had with Omar, the teenage son he had been training as his heir, who bore a striking resemblance to his father. Omar had never shared his father’s obsession with war, and after he learned of his father’s coming Planes Operation, he became determined to leave. He had gone to his mother, Najwa, pleading with her to come with him. But she had never disobeyed her husband, so Omar had slipped away alone. “[My father’s] violent path had separated us for ever,” he later recalled.
But by the end of August 2001, Najwa had a change of heart. With Omar’s words playing on her mind, she asked to return to her parents in Syria – an unexpected act of rebellion from a woman who had stuck by her husband’s side for 26 years and given him 11 children.
Najwa had never intended to be a jihadi bride. Glamorous and beautiful, she was a Ghanem, from an old, cultured Syrian family, and had grown up in the cosmopolitan seaside resort of Latakia, where women wore bikinis. She had married Osama in 1974, when she had just turned 16 and he was still forging a reputation as a demon soccer player at his university, and for driving fast cars recklessly. She had been charmed by this doe-eyed boy, the 17th son of one of Saudi Arabia’s richest men, and also her cousin. Arriving as Osama’s young wife in Jeddah, she had reluctantly donned a chador and niqab, but underneath the black folds still wore lipstick and designer clothes.
Over the years, Osama’s demands had worn her down. His brothers’ wives remember her as downcast, drab and permanently pregnant. “[She] seemed almost completely invisible,” says Carmen bin Laden, the former wife of Osama’s half-brother Yeslam.
Najwa had sought help for her sons at a clinic in Jeddah, where she met Khairiah, a child psychologist, seven years older than Osama. Osama wanted to have as many children as possible “for Islam” and Najwa suggested Khairiah could help him achieve that, as well as assist with their sons’ education. Osama judged that she was perfect: the Prophet had decreed that men should wed “unmarriageable” women to enable them to share the joy of motherhood.
Khairiah eventually bore Osama a son, Hamzah, who went on to inherit his father’s religious fervour, while she forged a role as the extended family’s matriarch. It was in her room in Kandahar that everyone gathered to resolve disputes and discuss impending changes, or to lobby for an extra sack of rice, basic medicine or schoolbooks.
Unlike Najwa, Khairiah was devout, and had married Osama in 1985, when he was already well on the path to jihad. Osama’s fourth wife, Seham, was also deeply religious, claiming descent from the Prophet and holding a PhD from Medina University. She had worked as a teacher before she married Osama, in 1987, at which point she too set herself the task of having as many children as she could. Before 9/11, Seham’s hut in Kandahar had been the family classroom, complete with slates, chalk and secondhand exam papers purchased in the bazaar. The children remember how Osama would occasionally interrupt, conducting impromptu maths and English tests, with his children lined up in order of size.
Osama expected all his children to play their part in jihad. Rather than celebrating birthdays, the boys were videotaped brandishing weapons or visiting the scenes of battle. Daughters were married at the onset of puberty to mujahideen fighters twice their age, to expand al-Qaida’s sphere of influence.
Only Najwa fought to soften the children’s world and they were drawn to her, eager for the treats she procured, especially her radio on which they remember listening to American pop, and eating her improvised spaghetti bolognese – tomato puree mixed with a packet of Maggi noodles.
So it was Osama’s decision to marry a Yemeni teenager, 18-year-old Amal al-Sadeh, in June 2000, that transformed an unconventional family into a dysfunctional one. Shortly before 9/11, Amal gave birth to a daughter and Najwa walked out, taking her youngest children and one adult son whose disabilities made him dependent on her. As they drove away, headed for Syria, Najwa turned to see the rest of her family enveloped in the dust.
“My mother’s heart broke into little pieces watching the silhouettes of my little children fade into the distance,” she said later. Khairiah and Seham stayed, but froze out Amal.
Then came 9/11, trumping every other concern.
Osama departed, giving each of his sons a string of prayer beads and urging them to “stay strong and true to Islam”. He left behind suitcases containing clothes and gold coins. Dressed in tribal robes, his family would travel through the night and attempt to cross into Pakistan at a remote checkpoint, using documents provided by the Sudanese authorities during the time they lived there in the 90s. Their old Saudi passports were sealed in brown envelopes and hidden away.
***
Mahfouz debated with his colleagues for days what to do with Osama’s family. CIA agents were closing in everywhere. US helicopters flew along the Pakistan border. He needed to escort his charges to somewhere that was completely off limits to America. They were among the world’s most wanted, and relatively easy to spot: tall, fine-boned Arabs, several of whom closely resembled Osama, and who spoke no local languages.
In the end, they reached an unlikely conclusion: send the wives and children of Osama bin Laden, leader of an outlawed Sunni militia, to seek asylum in Iran, the centre of Shia power.
Among the al-Qaida families to arrive were Khairiah and a group of Osama’s children; Seham and her children had elected to stay behind in Pakistan. In Iran, they were guided by Saif al-Adel, al-Qaida’s military commander, to a remote farm east of Zabol.
The advice was of no comfort to Hamzah, who still carried the string of prayer beads his father had given him in the olive groves of Melawa, a moment so painful that he later wrote about it in a letter, saying he “remembered every smile that my father smiled at me, every word that he spoke to me and every look that he gave me.”
When Saif made it clear to the family that he was directly in touch with Osama, Hamzah wrote him a letter, later released by al-Qaida. Born into jihad, Hamzah had never known peace. Now that he was in Iran, he could see no future. “Tell me, Father, something useful about what I see,” he pleaded in 2002. “What has happened to us?”
A few weeks later, Osama, though in hiding and on the run, replied: “Suffice it to say that I am full of grief and sighs. Pardon me, my son, but I can only see a very steep path ahead.” He had a message for all the family: even though they had reached Iran, they were still not safe. “Security has gone, but danger remains.”
By 2007, Osama’s family in Iran had expanded, with the birth of several grandchildren, and they had been relocated to another building in the complex, this one called Block 300. Tensions with their hosts, terrible food and unsanitary conditions had taken their toll. Saad, 28, was by now the father of three children, a boy named Osama and two little girls. A few months earlier his wife, Wafa, had had another son who died because the Iranians had refused a hospital visit. Another shura member’s wife had also died for want of medical treatment; Khairiah suffered excruciating dental problems and walked with a cane.
Osama’s grandsons pelted guards with stones, shouting, 'We have been illegally kidnapped and hidden in this secret jail'
A temporary rapprochement was reached during Ramadan in October 2007, when the Iranians took al-Qaida out for an iftar (breaking the fast) meal at a five-star restaurant in downtown Tehran. Osama’s sons reciprocated by inviting the officials to dine with them in the compound. The following Friday, a car arrived at Block 300 to pick them up, before speeding toward Tehran University. Osama’s sons were greeted by officials who led them through the security gates and around the back of a covered prayer hall into a small waiting area carpeted with prayer mats.
***
Abu Ghaith’s mania eventually caused the Iranians to snap. But when the guards tried to manhandle him, a full-blown prison riot exploded. Egyptian and Libyan al-Qaida brothers ripped up sheets and shattered wooden beds, setting fires, hurling petrol bombs made with secretly stockpiled heating fuel and daubing anti-Shia messages on the walls. Mahfouz remembers watching as Osama’s grandsons pelted guards with stones. “We have been illegally kidnapped and concealed in this secret jail,” they shouted, thumping the wall. “Our ongoing incarceration goes against international law.” They would rather be prosecuted than remain in this “living cemetery”, they said.
Hamzah vowed to sign up for the jihad. His mother, Khairiah, declared she would return to her husband’s side. Meanwhile, Osama’s 17-year-old daughter Iman wished to go to her mother, Najwa, in Syria. However, first someone had to escape to raise the alarm. Everyone hesitated. Despite the tough talking, they had all become fearful of the outside world.
Soon after, Fatima learned that Khadija, her favourite sister, had died in Waziristan giving birth to twins. One baby was also dead; the other, a girl, was critically ill. Fatima was devastated. Deep depression settled over the family compound.
In May 2008, Iranian officials arrived on a detente mission, carrying boxes of sweets and cakes. Saad bin Laden spotted that the gate had been left open and, speaking fast in Arabic, he ordered his nephews and nieces to make a run for it. They hurtled out toward the entrance, surprising the Quds force guards, who stood down, not wanting to fire on children. Soon they were joined by their mothers, who sat down by the main gate, through which they could see members of the public strolling by.
“We want freedom, we want human rights,” Mahfouz remembers the women chanting, remaining immovable for the next 36 hours. Confronted with a top-secret cache of al-Qaida hostages crying out for help, Major General Suleimani sent in ice-creams for the children and a lavish meal for the adults, served out on the gravel. But no one budged. Exasperated, the Iranians eventually sent soldiers dressed in black overalls and ski masks to beat the families back into Block 300.
Days later, Osama’s family was given 24 hours’ notice to pack. Since the Iranians could no longer control their al-Qaida guests, the family was moving. They were driven into the country’s central desert, to the historic city of Yazd. Their new home was a sand-coloured villa surrounded by a low mud-brick wall.
The Iranian escorts took rooms closest to the main gate. There would be no trips out, they said. Such privileges had been lost. But as the family members wandered around, one thing struck them: there were no security cameras at the rear. Hamzah volunteered to hop over the back wall. Khairiah vetoed it. At 19, he was too young. Besides, his wife, Asma, had just given birth to a daughter. Saad, the eldest son present, said he would do it. His siblings shook their heads in disbelief – he would never survive. But that night, Saad slipped over the wall into the desert night. He was determined to find his father in Pakistan and then rescue them all.
After Saad’s escape was discovered, Osama’s family were transported back to Tehran, where they found a new kind of prison waiting for them at the heart of the Quds force complex. It consisted of purpose-built apartments for each family, a school, mosque, football pitch, even a swimming pool. As a joke, they referred to it as the “Tourist Complex”. But with tall walls and motion censors, it was a more modern prison and from their rooms they could hear Quds force recruits training.
At the end of the first month, some of Osama’s sons were offered their first phone calls. Whisked to the Afghan border and given a Thuraya satellite phone – a location and device that were intended to confuse American eavesdroppers – they were ordered to say nothing about their precise location. They reached Omar bin Laden, Osama’s son who had left Afghanistan before 9/11 and was now living in Qatar with his British wife Zaina. Over the years, Omar and his mother, Najwa, had written to the International Red Cross and the United Nations in search of their family. Now, stunned, they got a call from the desert. Omar promised to help.
The phone party returned to Tehran, their spirits buoyed. But then came news from Pakistan. Saad bin Laden was dead – killed in a drone strike in Waziristan. That night, Osama’s grieving sons gathered. They had convinced each other that Saad had been reunited with their father, and now they felt hopeless.
***
On 21 November 2009, Mahfouz was deep into his late night Qur’anic reading when he heard a knock at the door. He opened it to find Iman, Osama’s daughter, now 18, requesting to see his daughter Khadija, her best friend. When they were alone, Iman took off a gold ring and handed it to her. “This was a gift from my father but now it’s yours,” Iman said, explaining that something was about to happen that would “hit the compound like an earthquake”.
Slipping off her niqab, Iman swaddled a doll as if it were a baby, and made her escape
While Khairiah and Fatima bin Laden filled their trolleys, with excited young children trailing behind, demanding sweets, Iman pulled Khadija into the toy section. Weren’t they too old for this, Khadija asked? Iman grabbed a lifesize baby doll and took out some clothes she had snatched off a shelf elsewhere in the store. Khadija watched, stunned, as her friend changed into them, slipping off her black abaya and niqab, and transforming herself with an Iranian chemise, a pair of jeans and a colourful headscarf wrapped around her hair in the Iranian style. Then she swaddled the doll in a blanket as if it were a real baby, embraced her friend and set off. “What are you doing?” Khadija hissed. “What does it look like?” Iman called back, before vanishing into the crowd.
It took a few minutes for their Iranian escorts to realise she was missing, and then intelligence agents swarmed into the square. But Iman was too quick for them and had asked the first woman she saw with a phone if she could borrow it. She rang her oldest brother, Abdullah bin Laden, a Jeddah businessman who had rejected his father’s lifestyle back in 1995. Unable to believe he was talking to someone he had thought was long dead, he instructed Iman to run to the Saudi embassy. He would call ahead.
Back in the Tourist Complex, the family sat in silence, too frightened to be hopeful. For three days there was no news. Then, as Mahfouz and his family watched a local cable channel, a ticker tape ran across the bottom of the screen. Normally, it carried service updates or ads for local kebab shops. But this one was different. “Iman is fine,” it read. “She has come.”
Iman bin Laden was reunited with her mother Najwa in Syria in early 2010, after spending more than 100 days inside the Saudi embassy in Tehran. She now lives in Jeddah with several siblings, including Fatima; her mother often travels to Qatar where many other family members live, including Omar and Ladin.
After a year in Pakistani detention, Khairiah, Seham and Amal, who had all witnessed the killing of their husband, were deported, along with 11 children and grandchildren, to Saudi Arabia. Today they live in a compound outside Jeddah.
Mahfouz, who watched the news reports on Osama’s death from the Tourist Complex, finally escaped Iran in 2012 and returned to Mauritania.
Media outlets reported that the nine metre (29ft) aircraft’s return caused a sonic boom that rattled central Florida and could be heard as far away as Tampa and Fort Myers.
The X-37B, one of two in the air force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office.
The orbiters “perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies”, the air force has said, without providing details. The cost of the program is also classified.
The Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group promoting the peaceful exploration of space, says the secrecy surrounding the X-37B suggests the presence of intelligence-related hardware being tested or evaluated aboard the craft.
The vehicles are about one quarter of the size of the now-retired space shuttles.
The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV, first flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December 2012 and returned after 22 months.
Sunday’s landing was the X-37B’s first in Florida. The three previous landings took place at Vandenberg air force base in California. The air force relocated the program in 2014, taking over two of Nasa’s former shuttle-processing hangars.
Le Pen says she's not 'against immigrants, just against immigration' – it's like being against juggling but not jugglers
And what of her opponent? For Le Pen, Macron represents “a morbid continuity, littered with the corpses of jobs transferred offshore, the ruins of bust businesses, and the gaping holes of deficit and debt”. (Such apocalyptic metaphors of death and decay are, it must be admitted, very fascist.) Macron himself is having none of it. Le Pen, he says, is “a threat to democracy” who propagates “dangerous untruths”; she leads a party that still promotes “hatred” and is against “liberty”. It’s promising the people “presents”, but they are “lies” that the party could never finance. (One thinks mildly here of £350m a week for the NHS.)
So will the French vote for the people, the Republic, la France, or something else? The Front National, Macron warned this week, is actually “the anti-France party” – an interesting choice of words, given that the phrase “anti-France” was first coined by the French far right who imagined Jewish conspiracies at the end of the 19th century. The civilised choice is clear, but when each side accuses the other of being the enemy of the people, one may forgive the people for thinking they don’t have many friends left in high places.
Cook said that there had been a “pause in purchases” due to “earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones”.
Apple reported iPhone sales of 50.8m in the first three months of 2017, down by 1% year-on-year. Its revenues grew 5% to $52.9bn, which was just below analysts’ forecasts of $53.1bn.
The company’s financial performance is heavily reliant on the iPhone. While it generated more than $33bn of sales in the quarter, a category it defines as “other products”, which includes the iPod, Apple TV and the Apple Watch, generated just $2.9bn.
While the Apple Watch may be popular with those who use it, it has certainly not created a new platform of customers for the company to meaningfully develop – not yet, anyway.
Reports in the technology industry suggest that the next iPhone will be a significant step forward. According to rumours, it could include wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. But even so, an upgrade to an existing product is unlikely to be a game-changer in the same way that the original iPhone was a decade ago, or the iPod and the iPad were.
It would be foolhardy to call this the peak for Apple, because you can never be sure what mystery products are lurking in its research and development buildings. However, it is clearly becoming more difficult for Apple, Samsung and others to expand the smartphone sector. The devices are now effectively a commodity, particularly in the western world. The market is for customers looking to upgrade every couple of years rather than those looking to buy their first handset.
But a slowdown in its biggest market makes the $250bn cash mountain that Apple is still sitting on even more intriguing.
Analysts at Citigroup, the investment bank, have drawn up a list of seven companies that Apple could buy with the cash. Their candidates are Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla, streaming service Hulu, and video game makers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive.
Some of these deals, such as Disney or the videogame makers, would basically be bolt-ons that would allow Apple to share the success these businesses already enjoy.
Buying Tesla, however, could be transformative and help Apple down the path towards transferring its technology to driverless and electric vehicles. Rumours suggest that Apple may already be working on an electric vehicle anyway.
Even if Apple does not do a deal, it seems its next move will be about bringing its technology closer to our everyday lives, whether through a car or turning its headphones into health monitors, another rumoured plan.
As smartphone sales slow, we are closer than ever to finding out what Apple’s next move will be.
It is true that the last of the five profits warnings in the past four years arrived a few weeks after the end of Pearson’s financial year, but it was a humdinger of a warning. It signalled a cut in the dividend this year, thereby removing the sole source of solace for investors during Fallon’s ill-starred reign. The share price, even after the bounce that accompanied the unveiling of yet another restructuring plan, has halved in little more than two years.
Fallon is correct that the remuneration committee sets his pay. Thus Elizabeth Corley, chair of that committee, and Sidney Taurel, group chairman, must take direct blame for a fiasco that saw almost two-thirds of voting shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Almost a third also opposed Pearson’s forward-looking pay policy. That level of opposition is extremely rare at FTSE 100 companies.
Corley also received a 27% vote against her re-election. She is the former chief executive of giant investment manager Allianz Global Investors, so this was a case of shareholding fund managers voting against one of their own. She should take the hint and go. Pearson’s commitment to “continuing dialogue with our shareholders” on pay will look thin if the same individual is sent out to bat again.
“We’re the world’s learning company,” says the corporate blurb, but Pearson has shown zero understanding of the public anger over undeserved corporate pay. The lesson isn’t hard: when you’ve reported record losses, don’t give the boss a bonus.
Oil industry hopes that the price of Brent crude would stabilise at around $60 (£46) a barrel were dashed last week.
But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week.
For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.
The creator of Pepe the Frog has symbolically killed off the cartoon frog, effectively surrendering control of the character to the far right.
Matt Furie, an artist and children’s book author, created the now-infamous frog as part of his “Boy’s Club” series on MySpace in 2005. Pepe took on a life of its own online as a meme, before being eventually adopted as a symbol by the “alt-right” in the lead-up to last year’s US election.
In September, Hillary Clinton identified Pepe the Frog as a racist hate symbol, and Pepe was added to the Anti-Defamation League’s database of hate symbols.
But he now seems to have conceded defeat, killing the character off in a one-page strip for the independent publisher Fantagraphics’ Free Comic Book Day. It showed Pepe laid to rest in an open casket, being mourned by his fellow characters from Boy’s Club.
Furie had been attempting to wrench back his “peaceful frog-dude” – whom he has often said he imagined as an extension of his personality – for more than six months. Pepe’s passing has been interpreted of his ceding control of the character.
“While it’s unlikely Pepe’s official death will stop extremists from co-opting his image, this was, perhaps, the most effective way for Furie to reclaim his character; Pepe’s soul has returned to his creator. Rest in Peace.”
“I can see why he must be dismayed that his own creation is being used in this way, so I don’t blame him for trying. In general though, I think it’s a dead end, yes.”
One of the ways the alt-right resisted easy interpretation was “through the kind of subcultural elitism and vague ironic in-jokey tone that Pepe represents well”, she wrote.
“Critics of the alt-right have a tendency to try to outdo them at their own game by ‘trolling the trolls’. This should be rejected in its entirety and not ‘reclaimed’ in any way ... There are many wonderful ideals for us to reclaim like beauty, utopianism, internationalism. Let them have their tedious nihilistic juvenile symbols.”
“Having your creation appropriated without consent is never something an artist wants to suffer, but having it done in the service of such repellent hatred — and thereby dragging your name into the conversation, as well — makes it considerably more troubling.”
Furie and Fantagraphics have been contacted for comment.
It needed therefore a new man – experienced, yes, but young, smart, advocating not the triumph of one camp (right or left), but reuniting them in a pragmatic and ambitious way with the best ideas and personalities of the right, the centre and the left. En Marche! was created by Macron just one year ago. Political leaders laughed then, but with 270,000 members and a candidate now elected president of the republic, it has become France’s leading political movement.
On the one hand he managed to convince people that it was important to liberate the country’s potential, create much better incentives for work, embrace entrepreneurship, free up markets, lower taxes, and give more autonomy to professors and school heads. And on the other hand, he said that it was vital to better protect the French by training them to do jobs in a new world, to focus the “welfare state” on those most in need, and to fight growing insecurity – both physical and material – with better teaching and more police officers.
What lessons can be drawn for the rest of the world? Macron has, in ending the left-right split, and slowed down the growth of populism, but – equally important – he has created a central platform that is strong, ambitious, reforming and optimistic, built on a clear understanding of the new world.
He will, however, need visible results in the next five years, or the extreme right or extreme left could win the 2022 presidential election.
The world should watch Macron closely. Because if he wins the war against populism and reduces unemployment while increasing stability, he can be an inspiration to many around the world.
The shadow chancellor said those most affected by income tax increases would be “the 1% at the top”, a figure that roughly equates to the proportion already on the highest, 45% rate, of income tax.
McDonnell was careful to avoid being too specific but when questioned he declined to rule out raising the top rate of tax to 50p, saying the party was still “consolidating and confirming our manifesto”.
McDonnell had hinted earlier in the weekend that those earning over £80,000 would be asked to pay a “modest” increase. This would effectively create a new tax bracket for those earning between £80,000 and £150,000.
Conservative sources responded by claiming that McDonnell backed an even higher tax rise, pointing to a 2012 blog in which he called for “the restoration of progressive income tax of 60% on incomes above £100,000”.
Those earning high salaries would benefit in other ways from Labour’s manifesto, he told the audience at the Museum of London. “I want to pay tribute to those who do pay their taxes at the high level,” he said. “They make their contribution and we thank them for that. At the same time, we want a fair taxation system. If we upgrade our economy, we will create a richer society.”
“I’m not working on wild hypotheticals,” he said. “I think we’ve got a period of time in which we’ve not been able to get our policies across. Partly that’s the media, I have to say. I have to be straight about that. But also we are campaigning with a united party, our campaign has got to step up a notch. The general election starts now.”
On the ground, local Labour activists opposed to Corbyn have been discreetly compiling data from voters on whether a change of leadership could persuade them to back the party. Activists in a number of areas where the Labour vote slipped in the local elections, including parts of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and West Midlands, have been asking voters “what could we change that would persuade you to vote Labour?” according to canvass returns seen by the Guardian.
Canvassers mark papers with a ‘J’ if voters suggest changing the leadership. Those who suggest the Labour leader is the problem will get call-backs from the local Labour MP to try to bring in personal votes.
Alan Johnson, a Labour former home secretary who is stepping down as an MP at the election, said Corbyn had shown he could deliver his message to “rallies to hundreds of supporters in safe Labour territory,” but had to expand this reach in the election. “Here’s a chance for him to do that and he has to grasp [it],” Johnson told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.
Muttonbird, sea plants and eel spines: these native New Zealand ingredients may no longer be components of many diets, but one woman and her cafe are trying to change that.
Jade Temepara, who is of Maori descent, set up Kākano just over a year ago in Christchurch. “Maori people are the unhealthiest, most unfit and most likely to have heart disease – and it’s because of our lifestyle,” says Jade. “Our cause is to bring our traditional food back, and to involve Maori people in the preparation.”
Part cafe, part social enterprise, Kākano was built with the help of the local homeless community on the site of the city’s old convention centre, which was destroyed by the 2011 earthquake. If you walked past it, you’d be forgiven for not noticing the low-rise Portakabin-style building, hidden behind rows of raised garden beds, which are planted with local herbs and vegetables. But it’s more spacious than it appears from the outside, seating 25 (there are an additional 40 seats out on the deck), and though decoration is minimal, the monochrome colour scheme, black and white photos and select few New Zealand handicrafts on display elevate the space.
The whole setup has a distinctly temporary feel, and that’s not by accident: it’s all designed to be “lift and shift”, and in June will be transported from this provisional site to a permanent location just around the corner.
Over the past year, Kākano has built up a strong following among locals, both Maori and non-, and also attracts tourists who, Jade says, “love our story”. Community classes held here – which teach adults and children how to grow and prepare their own food, from fermenting cabbage to gutting fish – always sell out.
An American president’s ex-girlfriend who claims she was written out of history. A scathing review from the New York Times. And a literary feud with a rival biographer.
The new book by Garrow, who describes himself as “essentially a Bernie Sanders democratic socialist”, offers a taste of how Obama’s legacy is likely to be contested. Its attention-grabbing element is Jager, now a professor of East Asian studies at Oberlin College in Ohio, who declined to be interviewed for this article.
Garrow writes how Obama and Jager met in mid-1980s Chicago, moved in together and talked about marriage “all the time”. He continues: “In their evenings at the spacious apartment on South Harper, Barack read literature, not history, while Sheila had more than enough course readings to occupy her time. And, of course, there was another dimension as well. Barack ‘is a very sexual/sensual person, and sex was a big part of our relationship’, Sheila later acknowledged.”
In the winter of 1986, according to Jager, Obama asked her to marry him. But when the couple visited her family home, Obama met her father and his best friend – both conservative Republicans. It did not go well. They talked politics and, at least in the view of the friend, Mike Dees, Obama “ended up getting beat up”. Jager’s father came out against the marriage.
The following year, according to Jager, Obama changed and gained a sense of manifest destiny. “He became someone quite extraordinary … and so very ambitious, and this happened over the course of a few months. I remember very clearly when this transformation happened, and I remember very specifically that by 1987, about a year into our relationship, he already had his sights on becoming president.”
Discussion of marriage dragged on, Garrow writes, but “it was affected by what Sheila describes as Barack’s ‘torment over this central issue of his life’, the question of his own ‘race and identity’. The ‘resolution of his “black” identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career’ and to the crystallization of the ‘drive and desire to become the most powerful person in the world’.”
“Barack’s prior relationships had been with women who, like himself through 1985, were citizens of the world as much as they were of any particular country or city,” Garrow writes. “But if Barack truly believed that his destiny entailed what he thought, he knew full well the value of having roots in one place and having that place be essential to your journey. And who more than Michelle Robinson and her family could personify the strong, deep roots of black Chicago?”
“I never understood why he wrote it that way,” Jager told Garrow. “There are whole passages from that book that are essentially copies of his letters to me. I always found it ironic that he was using his love letters to me to write his book and then completely omitted me from the entire account.”
The author said his researcher got the scoop on Jager in 2009 because, knowing what address Obama had lived at, it was simply a case of going to the University of Chicago library and pulling the student directories for 1986, 1987 and 1988 to see who else was living at the address.
Speaking from Pittsburgh on Friday, he said: “I find this really quite astonishing and humorous that given all of the inaccurate speculation about Barack’s life over the years, it dawned on no journalist that there’d be student directories from the 80s that you could go look at. It seemed like an obvious thing to do but nobody had done it.
“I was living in Britain at that time in 2009, and so I emailed her out of the blue and that began a very extensive email conversation.”
Garrow, who spent eight “very intense” hours with Obama last year and showed him the manuscript, said he had been taken aback by the intense media interest in this aspect of the book. “I’m sort of bemused because to me it’s not surprising that someone, anyone would have prior girlfriends. I don’t think that’s the most interesting thing about Barack.
“The single most important thing about Sheila and Sheila’s memories is her crystal-clear recollection of Barack beginning to talk about his political aspirations and sense of political destiny in 1987. That matches up with how everyone who came to know him at Harvard Law School from ’88 onward realised from day one this was someone who was going to be a politician.”
For Garrow, if not for headline writers, a more important and equally neglected part of Obama’s life is his eight years in the state legislature in Springfield, Illiniois, which were hugely politically formative. He also argues that Obama was once a firm supporter of single-payer universal health coverage and outspoken critic of government surveillance, only to reverse these positions once he reached the White House.
“Up through 2004, this was someone who lived a very modest, middle-class paycheck-to-paycheck life, and so to see him, as president, get so infatuated with celebrities – and we’ve seen that infatuation with celebrities and all this money and private airplanes continue this spring – I’ve just really come to feel that who he is now is astonishingly different from who he was up through 2003. To me, this is a much more substantive point than who was his girlfriend in 1987.”
Asked about Maraniss’s tweet accusing him of being vile and ignoble, Garrow said he had never met or spoken to him and denied feeling insulted.
“No,” he said. “I’m an academic. I think American life would be better without Twitter and I think we’d have a better country if the president was not on Twitter. What people say in a bar or a pub doesn’t necessarily merit being memorialised. So he doesn’t like being criticised in print. I’m not surprised.”
In the New York Times, Kakutani dismissed the biography as “a dreary slog of a read: a bloated, tedious and – given its highly intemperate epilogue – ill-considered book that is in desperate need of editing, and way more exhausting than exhaustive.”
A spokesman for Obama declined to comment.
Among drowned migrants belongings, Dawood found small plastic bags – not of drugs, but earth from their homelands
The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.
The president used his favorite bullhorn, Twitter, on Sunday to begin the lengthy process of browbeating wavering Republican senators into line. “Republican Senators will not let the American people down!” he said.
Republican Senators will not let the American people down! ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up - it was a lie and it is dead!
His chief of staff, Reince Priebus, signaled that a more dignified pace of debate might be tolerated in the Senate, in contrast with the unseemly haste of the House. “Everyone is excited and ready to go to work and take the time necessary to look at the bill … No one’s going to be beating down their door,” he said on Fox News Sunday.
But there were already alarming signs for the White House of a groundswell of discontent among moderates that presages a stormy ride in the Senate. Susan Collins, the senator from Maine who is an expert on healthcare, vowed to effectively bin the House bill and start all over again.
Making a veiled dig at the breakneck speed of the passage through the House, she told ABC’s This Week: “The Senate is starting from scratch. We are going to draft our own bill and I am convinced we are going to take the time to do it right. We will come up with a whole new approach.”
John Kasich, the governor of Ohio who sought the Republican nomination for president, sounded the alarm over the plan to rein back Medicaid expansion. He said that could impact 700,000 people in his state, a third of whom have mental illnesses or experience drug addiction.
“What happens to those people?” he asked on CNN’s State of the Union. “They give you a $3,000 or $4,000 tax credit to buy insurance. What do you think they can buy for that?”
Kasich also raised the other knotty problem that is causing divisions within the Republican party: pre-existing conditions. He was derisive about the $8bn subsidy allowed under the House bill to help set up “high-risk pools” to insure people with pre-existing medical conditions in states that opt to allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums to such individuals.
“These high-risk pools, they aren’t funded,” Kasich said, “$8bn is not enough. It’s ridiculous. States are not going to opt for that.”
Trump’s health and human services secretary, Tom Price, side-stepped questions over cuts to Medicaid and cover for pre-existing conditions. He stuck to his official line, telling CNN “the winners under Obamacare were the federal government and insurance companies, the winners under the program we provide will be patients and families and doctors”.
Underlying the increasingly bitter fight are concerns that if the legislation ends up hurting millions of Americans the party could itself be punished.
As Republican leaders downplayed the threat of a rout in 2018, Priebus, a former chair of the Republican National Committee, went so far as to suggest that voters would thank his party.
The electorate, he said, would “reward the Republicans that sat up and said, ‘We are not going to see the Obamacare system, which is failing and collapsing, continue any longer.”
The speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who was instrumental in ramming the legislation through, called the bill a “rescue mission”. He told ABC: “We are proud of this effort, it’s us keeping our promises and it’s a lot better than Obamacare.”
After the comment, his audience erupted in jeers and boos.
The author also said Donald Trump “sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m”.
“Trump was strutting up and down, talking to his new members about how they were part of the greatest club in North Carolina,” Dodson said. “And when I first met him, I asked him … you know, this is the journalist in me … I said, ‘What are you using to pay for these courses?’ And he just sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m.”
Eric Trump, the president’s younger son who is now executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, was also present.
Dodson continued: “So when I got in the cart with Eric, as we were setting off [to play], I said, ‘Eric, who’s funding? I know no banks – because of the recession, the great recession – have touched a golf course. You know, no one’s funding any kind of golf construction. It’s dead in the water the last four or five years.’
He said, ‘Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia'
“Now that was three years ago, so it was pretty interesting.”
He also said: “And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”
Dodson, meanwhile, recounted a meal of cheeseburgers and being enveloped in a “bro hug” by Trump, and said: “You know, I liked the guy. I liked him. I mean, he was somebody you’d like to play golf with.”
“And I told Arnold that the next night at dinner and he laughed and said, ‘Really, Shakespeare? It’s more like this.’ And he crossed his hands and put them at his own throat.”
The magazine’s tone is that of a frisky couple whose youngest child has recently left home to study PPE
We snap the word porn on to images of excess. We understand the meaning of phrases like food porn, property porn, plant porn, travel porn, cocktail porn, not because these are sexy things, but because we associate the word “porn” with the feelings we have when we look at them – a combination of desire and guilt, and fantasy, and disappointment at the celibate reality of our real lunch, our real home.
But while we know what porn means, what it stands for, to judge by the ever-growing number of takes on the subject, the lure of learning about it seems almost as powerful as porn itself. That’s how we excuse our obsession: porn stops being something private and dirty, and becomes instead something you can discuss with your partner’s boss at dinner parties over cheese.
The cycles of thought have rolled between empowering to dangerous and back again, with new incendiary debates on whether it’s right to call porn “work”. What the commentaries have in common though, is that they’re all deeply enervating.
Porn has proved as slippery and ungovernable as sexuality itself. However much people attempt to pick away at it with words, porn remains, this mountain looming above us, its shadow falling over everybody’s private lives. Ironically the act of intellectualising porn, drilling into the stone of it, is the one thing that threatens it, in that it makes pornography a chore and not sex, and therefore much harder for a person to enjoy during their “me time”. Despite featuring nudity and lust, debating pornography is the opposite of talking dirty.
The mandate of the outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, officially ends at midnight on Sunday 14 May and he is expected to vacate the Élysée earlier that day.
On Monday 8 May, the interior minister, Matthias Fekl, will officially announce the result of the presidential election. The first results, which came in at 8pm French time (7pm BST) on Sunday evening, are only estimations based on the initial count from several hundred polling stations that closed an hour before.
The handover of power takes place next weekend. The ceremony follows a well-rehearsed form: Macron will go to the Elysée and be received in the courtyard by Hollande. After a brief chat, Hollande will leave the presidential palace accompanied by the Republican Guard.
 Macron’s first engagement as president will be to pay tribute at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior at the Arc de Triomphe and visit Paris city hall.
Of those to be recruited to his government, Macron said: “I will choose them for their experience, their competence, what they have done and not for what they represent or their political weight ...
“They will be people who are important mayors, regional or general council presidents; people who have sometimes been ministers, but who do things and who will be able to run an administration and conduct a public policy.”
For other ministries, he is expected to fish from the Socialist and centre-right Les Républicains pools, luring experienced and respected politicians such as the former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s labour minister Xavier Bertrand from the right and the Lyon mayor, Gérard Collomb, from the left.
Christine Lagarde, the current IMF managing director, has also been mentioned.
Why not rig the system instead of letting the system rig us? I do not believe ballot manipulation can work. The Progressive Alliance ducks hard questions about what it means to be a “progressive” and does not think hard enough about whether this woozy label can unite a winning coalition. But the times are dark and are about to get darker. I have no right to dismiss new ideas without explaining them first
The “Blairite” Peter Kyle holds it with a tiny majority over the Tories (He’s a “Blairite” in the sense that everyone who does not worship at the Church of Jeremy the Martyr is a Blairite.) The Greens have not stepped aside here. They want Labour to give them the Isle of Wight before they make any more concessions.
If Labour wins Brighton Kemptown, Ealing Central, where the Greens have also withdrawn, and in as yet unnamed seats where the Progressive Alliance assures me deals are coming, it will show that the anti-Tory left can break out of the straitjacket first past the post imposes on Britain. The 2017 election will thus be the moment when an idea discussed at ill-attended conferences over cups of weak coffee has its rendezvous with reality.
I was impressed by the moral seriousness of Lucas’s Green activists I met in Brighton. Unlike Labour’s leaders, who are solely concerned with keeping control of their party, they understood the urgency of now. They know the Tories will take every seat they win as a mandate for a hard Brexit, for an impoverished NHS and for redrawing constituency boundaries in their favour. “We’re fighting the 2022 general election as well,” one told me. So we are and maybe the 2027 election, too. It took 14 years for Labour to overcome the Tory landslide of 1983. It took 13 years for the Tories to overcome the Labour landslide of 1997. You don’t just push landslides back up the hill.
For all that, progressivism is a feeble and thoughtless concept. It is apparently “progressive” to vote for the SNP. That they are nationalists who want to build borders between people, rather than tear them down, is irrelevant. The SNP is anti-Tory and that is all that matters. The Progressive Alliance adds that it is “progressive” to vote for Labour MPs who have given up on Europe and leaves the implication hanging that it is reactionary to vote against them and in favour of a decent deal with Europe.
If you want to see the weaknesses in the notion that what unites progressives is greater than what divides them at their starkest, come to Brighton. A believer in progressivism might imagine that Corbyn’s supporters would be pouring into Hove to defend Peter Kyle. They won’t, because they loathe him. Like the Labour leadership nationally, their aim is to purge Labour of all who disagree with them, not fight the Conservative party, whose electoral interests they serve with such puppy-like loyalty. Brighton shows Labour can’t form a progressive alliance with other parties because it can’t even form an alliance with itself.
Kyle goes further. He does not believe that voters in the 21st century will respond well to top-down politicians cutting deals on who should be on their ballot papers. He should persuade Greens to vote for him, he says, not restrict their choice.
He may be wrong. The Progressive Alliance may deliver Brighton Kemptown to Labour and we will have a new model to follow. I do not believe it for a moment. I believe that these manoeuvres are diversions from the hard job of building an opposition that can win. I could spend the rest of the day listing its political priorities: it will need to be patriotic, it will need to find a way of rebuilding our relations with Europe, it will need to think occasionally about creating wealth as well as spending it.
A change of culture is as important. To put it bluntly, “progressive” politics must stop being such a bellowing, joyless, finger-wagging movement. The foul sectarianism and the wholly unearned assumption of moral superiority, which has characterised the Corbyn years, has to give way to a culture that is more tolerant and less willing to take offence.
Self-criticism is not usually associated with strength. But here is a paradox. Only when “progressives” recognise their weaknesses will a rampant and rampaging right begin to fear them.
Macron’s triumph gives liberalism a good name. Its rehabilitation comes in the nick of time.
For months, establishment politicians have skulked in Europe’s corridors of power, listening to a growing populist clamour from without.
Like a modern-day mob raging at the gates of Versailles, neo-fascists, racists, ultra-nationalists and hard-left utopians laid siege to the self-appointed heirs of the Enlightenment.
But these would-be revolutionary forces were not confined to the political fringe.
The status quo had failed them. In working class heartlands, old loyalties broke and shattered. Their fury spilled over. They demanded change.
Analysts predicted an end to the postwar social democratic order and a return to the age of the autocrat. In the US, Trump’s supporters hailed a “historic” watershed moment.
In elections elsewhere, such as the Netherlands, extremists of left and right have also been rebuffed. Macron’s new ascendancy could re-energise the similarly youthful Matteo Renzi, a like-minded reformer now back in charge of Italy’s ruling Democratic party.
If Macron can turn ideas into facts, he will find more willing emulators in Spain, Greece and other European countries whose discredited political systems, like France’s, have seized up like old gearboxes starved of oil.
How Macron deals with Trump will be a telling test. But even Trump is not proving to be quite the nightmare that had kept many Europeans awake at night. His bark, at least so far, has been worse than his bite.
The Nato alliance has been rebooted, not retired. Russia’s Vladimir Putin has not suddenly been excused his misdeeds in Ukraine and Syria – or claims of serial election hacking.
Like Putin, Le Pen is a Trump soulmate – but a soulmate without power who missed her moment. If he has any sense at all, Trump will catch Europe’s shifting winds.
Given the alternative, maybe Macron’s win is no great surprise. Generally speaking the French have always seen themselves as a race apart. “Vive la difference” is no idle national slogan.
And while France’s open society traditionally tolerates political extremes, the mass of French voters, however angry and alienated, were never going to thoughtlessly follow in the path of Britain’s self-harming Brexiters or Trump’s blue-collar battalions.
Macron supporters gathered around the famous glass pyramid, where they watched the new president-elect give his victory speech at his campaign headquarters the other side of Paris.
A few hours later, he was there in person, looking serious and presidential as he strode across the Louvre courtyard to the stage. “Macron president. Macron president,” they cheered.
“Thank you my friends,” he told them. “What we have done for the last many months has no precedent or equivalent. Everyone said it was not possible but they didn’t know France.”
It was a sombre address for a celebration party. Macron said he accepted many had voted for him even though they disagreed with his programme to “defend the republic against extremism”. “I will protect the republic,” he told the crowd.
Macron said he was aware of the “anger, anxiety and doubt” that many French citizens felt and expressed in their vote. He said he would be “implacable and entirely resolved” in defending their security. “I will defend France, its vital interests, its image,” he said.
His primary task over the coming five years, he added, was to “calm people’s fears, restore France’s confidence, and gather all its people together to face the immense challenges that face us”.
Supporters had begun gathering outside the Louvre late in the afternoon, but security checks meant many people were still outside when the result was announced. The organisers had planned for 10,000 and numbers swelled dramatically as the night drew in.
Despite the party music, live bands, DJ and dancing girls, the crowd often seemed reticent and subdued. Macron’s supporters seemed happy, emotional, but not entirely overjoyed; an atmosphere reflecting the sense that the country had sailed very close to a perilous wind and gone through an experience that had left many traumatised.
 Ben Lounis, 39, a radiologist, who was born in Algeria, had brought his three children to celebrate at the Louvre. As the children, aged between six and 10, waved flags, he said: “I am very satisfied with the result. France has avoided the worst. I feel Mr Macron is an interesting and intelligent young man and I hope he will bring lots of good things to France and the whole world.
“I hope that under him we can find ourselves in a multi-cultural France where we regard each other as human beings. I have three children of mixed race, their mother is French, we live in France and we want to keep living in France. We were afraid of the alternative.”
Kardia, a French citizen who was originally from Burkina Faso, said she was “very happy” with the result. “We need a young president who will change things. For me it’s an important win for our children. The fact he is so young does’t bother me at all. He is just what France needs. A young entrepreneur.”
She said that Le Pen’s place in the election’s second round had made her afraid. “I’ve been in France for 20 years, lived in the US, now I live in Spain. My children are studying, living and working all over the world. I don’t understand this idea of France for the French. We need to have a world view.”
“The vow is we must never, ever allow Forest to be in this situation again,” the relieved manager, Mark Warburton, said after the game. “Can’t happen. The last five or six weeks, the relegation dogfight, it’s not what we’re about. We told the players: ‘Remember the feeling at kick‑off’, and that must never happen again.”
Before the game at the City Ground Mick McCarthy promised that he wanted to give the Ipswich fans “something to smile about” despite having nothing to play for, but one imagines not many of the travelling support came away with grins on their faces. This was not so much a bad performance as a non-performance, unable to take advantage of the inevitable nerves from a relegation-threatened side.
Forest started with some purpose, going close through a curling Jamie Ward shot in the third minute, but the nerves showed when Jordan Smith fumbled a routine cross, like a child handed a valuable vase and sternly told to absolutely, 100%, under no circumstances break it. Shortly afterwards, though, Smith made a save that Warburton described as “world-class”, tipping the ball on to the bar while changing direction after a close‑range Grant Ward shot took a deflection. Given the nerves that showed in leaden legs and confused decision-making early on, that save probably kept Forest up.
Forest still looked jittery after the break, sitting deep and with little composure to their play. But after 57 minutes they doubled the lead: David Vaughan squared to the captain, Cohen, around 25 yards out and his shot took a flick off a defender on its way to the top corner. There could not have been a more appropriate and popular scorer than the club captain, making his 300th appearance after last season returning from his third cruciate ligament injury.
Ten minutes later Forest had the chance to remove all doubt, when professional irritant Ward won another penalty, this time barged to the ground by substitute Josh Emmanuel. Assombalonga stepped up and side-footed to Bialkowski’s left but the goalkeeper produced a wonderful save to tip the ball over the bar.
No matter, though. Five minutes later Assombalonga jinked down the side of the area, was shown on to his left foot by a backtracking Luke Chambers and, accepting the invitation, launched the ball into the roof of the net with that very foot. A few moments later Vaughan, as so often Forest’s most composed character in midfield, crunched into a (fair) tackle and, for the first time in a while at the City Ground, there was a sense that everything was going to be OK.
Warburton’s thoughts have already turned to the summer and next season, with a clear idea of how he wants to shape the squad with the help of Frank McParland, the director of football he called “the best in the business”. Warburton said: “We’re not proud of being in a relegation fight. It’s a muted celebration in that respect but the job’s been done and now we can build.”
At St James’ Park, goals from Ayoze Pérez, Chancel Mbemba and the substitute Dwight Gayle secured a deserved 3-0 victory against Barnsley in front of the owner, Mike Ashley, and a crowd of 52,276 at St James’ Park, and Jack Grealish’s last-gasp equaliser for Aston Villa denied Brighton victory to allow the Magpies to leap-frog them into top spot.
Rafael Benítez, the Newcastle manager, has insisted for weeks that promotion was the only objective, but as he prepares for the talks with Ashley which will determine whether or not he remains on Tyneside he will do so with a bonus piece of silverware sitting in the trophy cabinet.
Shorn of the services of Jamaal Lascelles and the winger Matt Ritchie through suspension and injury respectively, Benítez was forced to play the midfielder Isaac Hayden in central defence, although his problems grew when the former Arsenal man had to leave the field with a head injury. As a result, the Magpies were disjointed as they set about their task with Barnsley enjoying the better of the opening 15 minutes.
However, as the midfielder Christian Atsu roused them from their slumbers, they slipped into gear and took the lead with 23 minutes gone. Jonjo Shelvey expertly clipped Aleksandar Mitrovic’s lay-off into the path of Atsu, who cut inside the full-back Callum Elder before back-heeling the ball to DeAndre Yedlin to cross for Pérez to cleverly flick home.
The Barnsley goalkeeper, Adam Davies, did well to turn Atsu’s fierce shot over the bar after the winger had tricked his way past Elder with the visitors under intense pressure, and he excelled himself a minute before the break to deny the same man as he fired hard and low towards the far post.
The substitute Massadio Haïdara blazed over from 12 yards just before the break and Pérez tested Davies seconds after it as Newcastle dominated but struggled to kill off the game. That changed when Davies dived to save Pérez’s stinging 59th-minute effort, only for Mbemba to follow up from close range and make it 2-0.
Davies was called up once again 10 minutes later to tip over Mitrovic’s header and Shelvey struck the foot of the post two minutes later, but opposite number Rob Eliot had to make late saves from substitutes Marley Watkins and Elliot Lee to preserve his clean sheet. Gayle added a third at the death and news of Villa’s equaliser sent the home fans into raptures.
The Seagulls were already promoted, ending a 34-year exile from the top flight, and victory would have seen them go up as champions but they lacked urgency and rhythm for long spells.
Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said: “Today is a negative day, it’s difficult, but there are far more pluses. What these lads have achieved this season has been magnificent. David has been excellent for us all season and he had made two very good saves from free-kicks before. There’s never any portion of blame. We have to accept it as a team.
“For us the season is finished and we have achieved our goal. We’re playing in a division where there are some very big teams, who have spent big money, and we have managed to come in the top two.”
Brighton rode their luck in the first half and Henri Lansbury wasted a glorious Villa chance as the home side finished a disappointing season 13th with the manager, Steve Bruce, needing to revamp his squad in the summer.
Villa, relegated last year, had long hoped there would be a promotion party in Birmingham but it was the visitors who were celebrating going up – even if they struggled to get going. Lansbury’s low effort was shovelled wide by Stockdale during a low key start. It was competitive enough but there was little action until Lansbury somehow managed to head wide from five yards after Sébastien Pocognoli chested the ball into his path.
Brighton seemed too relaxed over their title chase and needed Stockdale to bail them out after another Pocognoli error after 33 minutes. The on-loan West Bromwich Albion defender played a blind backpass to slip in Scott Hogan but Stockdale deflected his shot wide and the goalkeeper was then needed again to save Conor Hourihane’s free kick.
There was little on offer from Brighton and they survived a huge penalty scare five minutes after the restart when Lewis Dunk tackled Keinan Davis but the referee, Darren Bond, waved away Villa’s protests. But the visitors suddenly woke up as Murray headed wide and then Baldock forced Sam Johnstone into a smart save just before the hour. And the title swung Brighton’s way when they went ahead after 64 minutes. Murray slipped in Baldock and he managed to scuff an effort at Johnstone, only for the referee to rule Baker had fouled him before he got his shot away. The defender was sent off and Murray scored from the spot, his 23rd goal of the season.
Four minutes later Brighton should have doubled their lead when James Chester blocked Baldock’s effort following Tommy Elphick’s short backpass. But while it remained 1-0 there was always a chance the Seagulls could lose the title and Stockdale had to produce a fine stop from Hourihane’s free kick with five minutes left. However, the 31-year-old then cost his side the league title when he allowed Grealish’s low 25-yard effort to sneak in with a minute left.
Press Association
Their capes bear the slogan: “Lafiyar al’ummarmu hakkin kowa da kowa ne” – “The health of the child is the responsibilty of all.” The lunchboxes are filled with ice and polio vaccine. They have marker pens to dab on the finger of each treated child and chalk to mark every house wall they visit, marking which child was vaccinated and when. No one is to be missed out.
Ismail has mixed feelings as he watches, his useless legs tucked under him in the dust. He contracted polio aged two. “I blame my parents,” he says, “for not having me vaccinated, it makes me angry with them. I don’t feel so glad to see this today, I feel sad.”
Meanwhile, in a nearby village, other gunmen were slaughtering eight women, another team of volunteers. Three days before, a radio show had run an item in which an imam repeated allegations that the polio vaccine was a western plot to sterilise Muslims.
“I can say this,” said Musa. “Without Boko Haram polio would be a thing of the past. Some say health is not the problem; security is. They are linked. If we hear one child in Maiduguri has polio, then that means there are 200. So what if there are 10 children there? And very many children are coming out of the conflict zone. We don’t know, so we have to work harder. We persuade people by educating them. You make them understand. We have reduced the non-compliance rate here now to almost zero. I tell our workers ‘your names are written in gold’.”
But with some religious leaders sharing the distrust, what should have been a celebration of a disease eradicated is now a renewed struggle to finish a job that should have been over. Since the outbreak in Boko Haram-controlled territory, northern Nigeria has been in emergency mode. Teams of vaccinators are out almost constantly. “I almost cried,” said Rhoda Samson, “but not to finish the job is not acceptable.”
A supervisor in the mobilisation teams, Samson is thorough, checking every move her teams make. They visit a woman whose five-day-old baby still has no name. The chalk on the wall outside shows a list of visits here. “Seven times they have said no,” said Samson as her team coo over the baby. “Bamaso,” said the mother, Amina Ali. “We don’t want. My husband says vaccine is not food, why do the government not give us food? He refused and has not offended God.”
At this her husband, Ali Zaki, returns home, angry at the invasion of his house: “I believe God will provide; this is what we are taught.” But he is no match for Samson: “You think God doesn’t make the medicines? You want your children to have polio? To never play? Does Allah want that? What kind of man are you?”
When Zaki grudgingly agrees, the vaccine is quickly slipped into the baby’s mouth and the women clatter off, congratulating the couple. “They’ve a lot of reasons for refusing. We have some who don’t want drugs at all, some who say they won’t because they want something in return, some hear the stories,” said Samson. “The security situation is a problem. People are suspicious, they hear vaccinations make infertility. But we are bringing the numbers of non-compliants down; we will not stop.”
And they are not just fighting polio – they are creating a network and collecting data in a way never before done in Nigeria. A network of trained, community-based health workers, it’s a structure already being used to deliver other healthcare.
Senior state and government officials have recognised the value of this, gracing the polio flag-offs. In their elegant robes and themed hats, and long, often less elegant political speeches, their presence stresses to everyone in the fidgeting crowds of locals that something important is happening here. It is the kind of message that could reverse the damage done by Boko Haram, says Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, Kano’s health commissioner. “Kano used to be a hub of polio cases, now it’s best practice. The last case was 2014 and this did not happen by accident. The teams are headed by the governor himself, it’s high profile This is how we do it. We go into the field every day, every day the volunteers are out there. Then we can use these structures to develop an entire primary healthcare system.”
Displaced people are especially targeted in this campaign. Abule Abdullah has hosted seven families – seven mothers and 33 children – in her home in Katsina state. One of her current guests is Aisha Idris, 40, recently arrived from Maiduguri.
“Boko Haram forced us to come here. The insurgency has stopped everything, the hospitals, the schools, everything is shut down,” she said. “My husband was killed at his Islamic reading group by a stray bullet from the fighting. My child was sick and so I came here with my children. I have to live with no roof over our heads but they have all been vaccinated now.” At the bus stations, and the state and national border crossings, the lunchbox-toting teams are there. Peering into cars, lifting the cloaks of women perched on motorbikes to find the babies strapped to their fronts and backs. Squeezing in the little vials of vaccine.
“If they say no, then we tell them they can go back,” said superintendent of immigration, Charles Tashllani, imposing order on Nigeria’s border with Niger in Katsina. Here, late in the evening, the Polio Emergency Operations committee reviews the campaign’s first day, which has seen 3,661 teams immunise 28,882 underfives. The detail is such that eight missing marker pens are on the agenda, as is the sacking of two town announcers who did not inform people about the programme.
“We look at every single child, everyone counts to us. I’m dealing with human beings. But we do have the iceberg phenomenon: many inaccessible, remote areas where we do not always know what is going on.
“People not feeling that polio is a threat to them, that is a big worry for a resurgence. But the biggest threat to health is Boko Haram. When we learned we had Borno refugees here in Katsina we were worried; they melt into the communities. It is potentially dangerous.”
The legacy of polio can be seen everywhere in Nigeria. Aminu Ahmen el-Wada lives with Hadza, his wife of 28 years, and those of their nine children who still live at home. One of life’s cheerful souls, he is enormously proud of the length of their marriage. “The trick is when I am the problem, I say sorry, when she is the problem, she says sorry,” says Wada.
The couple both skim along the floor using wooden handles Wada designed and carved to protect their hands – when your legs are withered from polio and are folded tiny and useless below your torso, your arms are the limbs that propel you. “I went to school until I became too heavy for my parents to carry me there,” said Wada. “So I taught myself to make hand-operated cycles, first for myself, then for others.” He now employs 20 people, 15 polio survivors. “Otherwise we would be beggars. This is because in Africa nobody can help you if you are disabled. But my father told me: ‘Disabled is in the body, not in the mind or in the heart,’ and this is what I believe.”
His smile falters only when he introduces Ummar, 14. His son contracted polio during a hiatus in the immunisation programme. “It was horrible. But the place behind our house is where people defecate. This is what happens.”
Wada began the Polio Survivors Group, which supports the vaccination drives. “I tell people: ‘Look at me. Do you want your child to end up like this? To never play football?’” Although he acknowledges the irony in that he also coaches a polio survivors’ para-football team. “But they would rather play for Arsenal,” he grins.
In his open-air workshop by the side of a main road in Fagge, the air smells poisonous as the men who would otherwise be beggars weld, cut and paint, making the three-wheeled, arm-operated cycles that give a certain freedom of movement. “This is the small size, for age five, then they can move up, age teenage, age adult,” he says. “One day I would like it that we make no more because polio is eradicated. Then we will make playground equipment instead, slides for happier children.”
He fires up his beaming smile: “Years ago in Nigeria we had leprosy, smallpox. We chased them all away. Now the last one is polio.”
Fernando Gaviria claimed his first Grand Tour stage victory as what looked like being the most straightforward day of the 100th Giro d’Italia blew apart in howling winds in Sardinia.
Gaviria took the stage win and the race leader’s pink jersey after the Colombian’s QuickStep-Floors team led the decisive break when echelons split through the peloton on the final approach to Cagliari.
A bunch sprint had been expected at the end of the short, flat 148km stage from Tortoli, but the peloton was buffeted by winds reaching 40km per hour in the final 30km. As the road changed direction several times, the winds turned from crosswinds to headwinds again and again, splitting the pack apart and meaning only four riders crossed the line on the same time as Gaviria.
Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas fought gamely to join the QuickStep-led escape before dropping back, but he finished with the main contenders to sit 11th overall, 23 seconds down on Gaviria.
The first comprehensive research on so-called revenge porn has shed light on the “mass scale of victimisation” across Australia and its sometimes devastating impact.
“Image-based abuse has emerged so rapidly as an issue that inevitably our laws and policies are struggling to catch up,” wrote Dr Nicola Henry of RMIT, the lead researcher on the study.
Twenty per cent of respondents had had images or videos of a nude or sexual nature taken without their consent; 11% had had them shared; and 9% had received threats that images of themselves would be shared.
Men and women were equally likely to be victims but the rate was higher among younger people: one in three teenagers aged 16 to 19 and one in four aged 20 to 29 reported at least one form of image victimisation. Marginalised groups – Indigenous and gay, lesbian and bisexual Australians, and those with a disability – were especially vulnerable.
The online survey of 4,274 people aged 16 to 49 only captured those who had discovered their images had been distributed, mostly on social media – but victims whose images had been shared in closed online communities dedicated to the practice may never find out, she said.
“Even though these findings in themselves are showing a high rate, it’s quite possible that people are the victims of image-based abuse and unaware of it … “There’s a hidden dimension that you just can’t capture with a survey.”
Though victims were equally likely to be male or female, the majority (54%) reported that the perpetrator was male. Women (39%) were more likely than men (30%) to be victimised by an intimate partner or former partner.
But researchers had opted for the term “image-based abuse” over “revenge pornography” to broaden understanding of the range of motivations and perpetrators, and to capture its damaging psychological toll, said Powell.
Previous findings had shown that images were used as means of abuse for a range of reasons, including control, intimidation, sexual gratification, monetary gain and social status building.
“‘Revenge porn’ does make you think of that jilted ex-lover scenario, or the public shaming aspect of the image, but it doesn’t reflect the full nature of the behaviours or their harms,” said Powell.
“Victims do report experiencing this as a form of sexual violation or sexual violence.”
Eighty per cent of victims who had been targeted by threats to distribute an image reported experiencing “high levels of psychological distress” that researchers found to be consistent with a moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety disorder.
Overall victims of any image-based abuse were almost twice as likely as non-victims to report experiencing high levels of psychological distress.
Only Victoria and South Australia have specific laws against the distribution of intimate or invasive images without consent – but the survey found overwhelming support for such a measure, with four in five respondents agreeing that it should be a crime.
A dedicated helpline, similar to the Revenge Porn Hotline established in the UK in 2015, could be established to help support victims.
Researchers also noted the responsibility of social media platforms and internet providers to take action on preventing image-based abuse and supporting victims through the creation of safe spaces online.
When my own son, then aged 12, started asking on Sunday nights, “Was that a weekend? Are you kidding?” I knew what he meant. In my family of four, weekends had become as gridlocked as weekdays. My husband and I were shuttling the kids to sports and playdates, cleaning and fixing our old, broken house, doing the washing – in short, tackling all the tasks neglected during the time-crunched week of a two-career household. And in between, we were scheduling pockets of work. What my son was mourning wasn’t the end of a great weekend, but the fact that those two days hadn’t seemed like a weekend at all; they were barely distinguishable from the five days before it.
The other culprit is the thing in your hand that you may be reading this on. Technology binds us to work, and we move through our weekends as if on call, checking email and asserting our loyalty – and importance – by engaging with work. No one wants to look less than totally available in fragile economic times.
Of course, we shop because it’s fun. Shopping has been shown to release dopamine, a hit of instant gratification. This is “passive leisure”, and if we are lucky enough to get time off at the weekend, because we are stressed and overworked, we may be inclined to veg out and binge-watch box sets or tuck into the football marathon, decompressing mindlessly. These impulses sometimes deserve indulging, but the satisfactions are often fleeting.
Many parents feel the pressure to cultivate the perfect weekend – to engineer the perfect childhood
Even though she is exhausted and a little miserable, my friend is praised for her hard work. The Protestant mindset has a firm grip in the culture: live to work, not work to live. We get competitive about our busyness (“I stayed until 9pm!” “I stayed until 10pm!”) because it makes us look wanted and worthy – supply and demand. It is hard to shake the ingrained value that time must be utilitarian and occupied, which is why taking two days off can seem suspect, or a bit like failure.
This more-faster-better mode slips into our family lives, too. Many parents feel pressured to cultivate the perfect weekend as part of an overall effort to engineer the perfect childhood. So our children spend their weekends being lugged from enriching course to high-level sport to a scheduled 90-minute visit with other toddlers while the parents limply hang about the edges of the room. Such problems are a privilege, of course, but it can be hard to resist the madness. How can we not register Charlotte for Mandarin when everyone else is doing it? The fear of falling behind is a powerful force working against leisure. But reclaiming unoccupied time at the weekend may be the most successful parenting strategy of all. In boredom and spontaneity, our kids figure out who they are. Unstructured play brings creativity and joy, while overscheduled kids become anxious young adults.
Since my son’s bemoaning of the weekend, our family has become better at declaring certain weekend days “off”. If I need to work, I try to put a clock on it – a few hours, no more – so it doesn’t drift, consuming those two precious days. We do some shopping and cleaning in the week, or – better – declare a perfect home impossible and live with mess. We try to turn off the devices, and visit the people we love.
We don’t always succeed. I still fall into a Twitter hole, or a kid’s football tournament takes over. Protecting the weekend requires vigilance. The goal is that every weekend includes at least a little unoccupied time, devoid of economic compulsion, to see what might happen. In childhood, those open weekends allowed me to stumble towards myself. Later, the kid with the tape recorder became a film critic, and a writer. My weekends revealed who I was, just as our crunched, chaotic ones tell us more about who we are than we might like to know.
I have a fondness for softly spoken cheese that is just a short step from milk
Back at home, I left the burrata in a dressing of orange zest and juice, crushed coriander seeds, wine vinegar and a few flakes of dried chilli. Once the cheese had taken up a little of the flavours from the marinade, we ate it alongside a spinach and blood orange salad. One wobbly, barely set cheese and a handful of spinach each. The young leaves, their points as sharp as a spear, appeared again in a hastily put together lunch with shoots of wild garlic, the two greens forming a soft pile into which I tucked pieces of taleggio. Once heated the cheese formed pools that spilled down on to the thick hot toast beneath. I caught it just as the cheese started to liquefy, before it had a chance to colour and become chewy.
These cheeses, along with soft, mousse-like goat’s cheeses, are light enough to fold into the eggy clouds of an omelette or to spread straight on to sweet white brioche and top with early strawberries. There is something fleeting about these cheeses, with flavours that are pure and unchallenging. There is a delicate note that makes them candidates for breaking into small pieces and tossing with young peas, fresh from the pot, in lieu of butter. Or how about folding pieces of taleggio or mozzarella into warm steamed rice, so the cheese softens rather than melts, lightly coating the grains. I rather think basil is then called for or chopped leaves of tarragon.
Taleggio melts particularly easily, but you could use fontina or any soft cheese should you wish. Wild garlic leaves have a short season, so I tend to make the most of them while they are here. I have yet to have any success with planting them in the garden.
Wash the spinach thoroughly and remove the toughest of the stalks. Without shaking the leaves dry, put them into a large saucepan over a moderate heat, covered tightly with a lid.
Grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat just before it turns gold
Let them steam for a minute or two, then turn the spinach over, and continue cooking until the leaves have wilted. Drain and refresh the leaves in iced water. Squeeze the leaves in the palm of your hand to remove as much water as possible, then separate them as best you can. If the leaves are very large, chop them roughly.
Mix together the crème fraîche and mustard in a mixing bowl. Put the spinach in the bowl then fold into the mustard crème fraîche and a little salt and black pepper. Toast the pieces of sourdough until lightly crisp and golden on both sides. Remove the stalks of the garlic leaves and cut them into small dice. Keep the leaves intact. Cook the leaves and chopped stems for a minute or two in the butter, just until the leaves wilt. Remove, drain and stir in the spinach.
Get the oven grill hot. Pile the spinach and garlic mixture on to the toasted bread. Tear the taleggio into large pieces and tuck among the spinach. Grate the parmesan and scatter over the top then grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat before it turns gold.
Buffalo mozzarella is fine here, too, but use burrata if you can get hold of it, for its texture – which is softer and more fragile.
Make the marinade by grating the zest of the blood orange into a deep container large enough to take the cheeses. Halve the orange and squeeze the juice into the zest. Add the olive oil, the dried chilli flakes and the red wine vinegar. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the coriander seeds and add to the marinade with a coarse grinding of black pepper. Open the cheeses, drain them of their packing liquid then place them in the marinade. Turn them over to coat with the marinade then cover and refrigerate for at least four hours. Turn the cheese over in the marinade every 40 minutes or so.
Make the salad. Peel the oranges taking care to remove all the white pith that lies under the skin. Save as much juice as you can and pour it into a bowl. Pour the marinade from the cheese into the bowl and return the cheeses to the fridge. Trim the asparagus then cut into long thin shavings using a vegetable peeler. Push the asparagus into the marinade. Trim the spinach leaves, toss them in olive oil, a little salt and pepper and divide between two plates.
Slice the blood oranges and place them in the spinach, lift the asparagus from the marinade and pile on to the plates. Place a cheese on each plate and slit it open. Spoon the marinade over the cheese and the salad.
It was the first time in 13 league meetings between the managers that Wenger had come out on top but the bigger picture for Mourinho concerned what he felt was the end of United’s top-four hopes. With three matches to go, United are four points behind the fourth-placed Manchester City and Mourinho said that he was pinning his hopes of reaching next season’s Champions League on winning the Europa League.
United are 1-0 up against Celta Vigo from the semi-final first leg last Thursday. The return leg is at Old Trafford this Thursday, after which United will play their final three league games – against Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton (both away) and Crystal Palace (home) – in the space of eight days.
“The top four? Impossible,” Mourinho said. “For two reasons. I don’t think the other clubs [in the race], who are playing one match a week, are going to lose. And, because we go with everything on Thursday [against Celta Vigo], we cannot go with everything at Tottenham.
“Go with everything at Tottenham and it’s difficult. Without everything, it’s more difficult. Then we play Southampton and Palace. I don’t think we have any chance of the top four. We have to chase the Champions League by trying to win the Europa League.”
Wenger denied that the win over Mourinho’s team meant anything special – he was concerned purely with keeping Arsenal’s own top-four hopes alive. They have a game in hand on City, who they trail by six points. Mourinho was rather more theatrical on the subject of his first competitive defeat against Wenger.
“Arsenal’s fans are happy and I’m happy for them,” he said. “It’s the first time I leave and they’re happy. I leave Highbury, they were crying. I leave the Emirates and they were crying – walking the streets with heads low. Today they leave with their scarves [waving in the air]. It’s a big club. You think I enjoy a big club like Arsenal not winning trophies? I don’t enjoy it. But today I tried to win.
“Arsène Wenger is not a small manager, he’s a big manager – to have that record of winning so many matches [against him] is not normal. Normal is win, lose, draw. I really don’t care about it today. No problems. We shook hands and during the game I don’t like what I never like. He puts too much pressure on the fourth official every time.”
Wenger said that he started with Danny Welbeck because the former United striker always raises his game against his old club, and he saw him score the second goal. Granit Xhaka had opened the scoring in the 54th minute with a shot that deflected heavily off Ander Herrera.
“We started a bit nervous and under pressure but slowly we became better and, in the second half we controlled well the game,” Wenger said. “The first goal was quite lucky and the second goal was a great goal. I’m happy for Danny. Hopefully it gives him confidence.
“We now have a big game on Wednesday night at Southampton and we need to be calm and focused. We still have a chance [of the top four] and we need some help from teams around us. I watched the Liverpool game [against Southampton] before we kicked off and I saw the penalty that the referee gave to them. It was a very nice decision.”
Mourinho had a different take on the match at Arsenal. “We didn’t deserve to lose,” he said. “The game was under control. They had a couple of chances in the first half but so did we and ours were the big chances. Arsenal scored and afterwards they brought the block low and defended well and coped with our attacking football.”
A search team examining a French forest for the body of the “disappeared” republican murder victim Seamus Ruddy has found human remains.
The remains were discovered in a forest near Rouen in the searches linked to the high-profile disappearance of the Newry-born teacher.
Ruddy was living in Paris in 1985 when he was abducted, tortured, shot dead and later buried in secret.
The independent commission for the location of victims’ remains, which was set up to find the “disappeared” from the Northern Ireland Troubles, has been digging in the forest since early this week. They confirmed on Saturday morning that fresh remains had been found.
The “disappeared” include more than a dozen people who were kidnapped, killed and secretly buried by the IRA during the conflict. Ruddy was the only victim of the INLA, a republican breakaway faction.
His sister Ann Morgan, who has run a long campaign to have her brother’s secret burial place located, went to the search site in the forest at Pont-de-l’Arche in northern France on Friday. It is understood she has been informed about the discovery of the remains, which are now being forensically examined.
The Irish Republican Socialist party, the INLA’s political wing to which Ruddy once belonged, said on Saturday it believed the remains were those of the missing teacher.
Ruddy was the victim of factional fighting within the INLA, a leftwing republican group which broke away from the official IRA in protest at the latter organisation’s ceasefire in 1972.
The INLA was split in the mid-1980s by the development of two rival factions, one of which controlled an arms-smuggling network that began with the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis, and was routed through communist Czechoslovakia and France before arriving in Ireland.
A rival gang within the INLA wanted to seize control of that network and sent a number of its activists to France on a mission to unearth caches of weapons that had been hidden before being shipped to Ireland.
This faction believed Ruddy was aware of the location of the arms dumps in France and kidnapped him after meeting him at a bar in the Montparnasse district of Paris in May 1985.
By this time Ruddy, who had previously been involved in procuring arms for the INLA, told the group that he had severed his links with the movement.
They did not believe him and after holding a second meeting in a Parisian apartment owned by a Derry man, abducted Ruddy, tortured him and shot him dead when he failed to give details about the arms dumps.
Ruddy was a popular figure within Irish republican circles and two years later allies exacted revenge on those they believed were responsible for his death and disappearance. They shot dead the INLA member John O’Reilly and his close friend Thomas “Ta” Power at a hotel near Drogheda. The counter-strike led to a bloody internal INLA fight which left 13 men dead and effectively tore the organisation apart.
There have since been a series of secret talks between the two former factions to try to find where Ruddy was buried. The ICLVR has carried out three previous searches in France, the most recent one in 2008.
Ruddy is one of four of the “disappeared” still missing, presumed dead. The others include Capt Robert Nairac, an SAS officer who was killed and buried by the IRA after being abducted while operating undercover inside a South Armagh pub in 1977. The other two missing men are Columba McVeigh, and the former monk and ex-IRA member Joe Lynskey.
The answer, for Jenner, was to throw herself into athletics. “I was the fastest kid in school and the reason I trained so hard for so many years had a lot to do with who I was. It made me more determined than the next guy to go out there and compete.” Athletic success, and the public acclaim that came with it, would surely “fix” her nameless unease, but it didn’t, not even winning an Olympic gold medal in the decathlon in 1976.
Marriage didn’t work, either. Jenner met her first wife, Chrystie, while they were students at Graceland University in Iowa. They were both sheltered, she writes; Chrystie the daughter of a minister, Jenner, despite her status as a jock, someone who had at that point only slept with one other woman. They married in 1972 and had two children, although by the time Casey, the second, was born, the marriage had disintegrated. “I use the term ‘distraction’,” says Jenner, “as in ‘that was my next distraction, my children’. And I get all sorts of hell from my kids for that. My kids were not a distraction in my life – they were wonderful – but it was a distraction from myself, from who I was.”
In fact, for the next two decades, Jenner was so preoccupied with her own unhappiness, she was almost entirely absent from the lives of her first four children, to the extent that her daughter, Casey, didn’t invite Jenner to her wedding in 2007 – something she suffered terrible guilt about, she writes, but now seems to have fully recovered from.
One of the critiques of Jenner is that her wealth and celebrity is so wildly unrepresentative of the average transgender experience – as she is at pains to point out, transgender Americans face staggering rates of poverty and violence, with nine trans women murdered in the US this year alone and “all of them were trans women of colour” – that her example is worse than useless. To speak of “authenticity” in the context of Jenner’s transition has almost no meaning, when that transition has been so cushioned by privilege and compromised by profit motive.
“Part of my camouflage?” she says. “Hmm. That’s interesting. Was it part of me hiding away from who I was? I think it had a lot to do with growing up in the 50s and 60s, and having a World War II father who landed on Omaha beach, believed in this country, and I loved all its freedoms. I don’t like big government. The only thing that’s going to get this country out of debt is the American people. Get the government the heck out of here!”
Does she regret voting for Trump?
That would seem to be a fundamental issue, I suggest.
“But I’m not a one-issue voter. So I would rather fight the Republicans to do a better job when it comes to all LGBT issues, than fight the Democrats to lower taxes and give us less regulations out there for business.”
When Kris Kardashian met Bruce Jenner in 1990, he – Jenner tends towards use of the male pronoun when referring to her pretransition life – was pretty washed up. His days as a TV sports commentator were over and he hadn’t had a booking for a public appearance in eight years. They met on a blind date and married within a year, whereupon Kris fired his agents, stuck his name on a line of gym equipment and thoroughly rebooted his career. They had two children, Kendall and Kylie, whom they raised alongside the four children from Kris’s previous relationship, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robert, the future stars of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
The most startling revelation of the book is that when they met, Jenner had been on hormone replacement therapy for four and a half years and had a bust size of 36B. Before meeting Kris, she had been determined to transition before turning 40 and the main controversy over the book has been Kris’s suggestion – made on her TV show – that Jenner married her on false pretences. Jenner says this isn’t so and that she told Kris from the outset she had gender issues. “Did I downplay it some? Of course I did. Because I was coming up off six years of hell, and of course I wanted to get back into the game. I’m sure I downplayed it, because I didn’t think 25 years later I would transition.”
Kris knew you had been taking hormones?
“Yeah.”
I’m surprised that wasn’t a bigger heads up to her that you were trans.
“A lot of women have that can-do attitude and think I can fix this guy. And I wanted to be fixed, to be honest with you. I wanted to get back into work. We paired up and were a great team. It was 23 years of my life. We raised wonderful children. She was an extraordinary good business person. I owe her a debt of gratitude for getting me out of this hole and getting me back working. It was a very mutual decision to split. I didn’t leave to go transition.”
“Attention in terms of what?”
Getting your own reality show –
“Oh, I don’t care about that stuff! I just don’t care about another show. It didn’t even cross my mind. My intentions were number one, to calm my soul. To deal with this issue and be myself. This woman had lived inside me for 65 years, it’s time for her to live! Let’s give her a shot and see what she could do. Bruce has done everything! Had all his children, won the Games. This woman – it’s her turn! And that platform I have: can I make a difference in the world?”
There wasn’t a tiny part of you that wanted to upstage your ex-wife?
“Upstage her? No. I just wanted to be me. Kris is a good person – we’ve had our differences, especially now – but she saved my life in so many ways, she turned my life around.”
“She made you lots of money, let’s face it,” I say and for the only time in the interview, Jenner looks annoyed.
“Yeah but I don’t care about money. I’m not a money person.”
After the marriage ended, Jenner told her business manager, “OK, I’m playing in the fourth quarter of life and for the last 25 years, I haven’t done anything for myself. I will enjoy this money.” She bought a “few little toys” – a nice “3,500 sq ft house on top of a hill in Malibu with a great view, not some mansion of a monstrosity like all my kids live in. It’s a humble little place. I bought an airplane, just a small one, because I’ve always been into aviation and Kris didn’t like that, so I’d been out of it for 15 years. I bought a couple of little race cars.” She shrugs. As she says, she’s not a money person.
Did Jenner regret not having transitioned at the age of 39, giving herself 25 more years of life as she was meant to live it?
“No. I have no regrets.”
“You wouldn’t have had the Kardashians,” I say.
“Well, that’s not part of it, your soul, and being happy,” she snaps. “This is the deal: it’s very simple. It wasn’t time. The issue wasn’t where it is today. I had just a few minor things done to make me feel better about myself, and I thought I’m going to do this before my 40s – I’m not going to be an old chick. I don’t want to be an old chick. And I got to 39 and I couldn’t do it. For six years I had isolated myself in a house, didn’t date, didn’t go out. And I’m thinking, boy, maybe I should get back into the game. I’m just sitting here in this house, rotting away. I just don’t have the guts to do it. I married Kris with great intentions.”
The Kardashian kids have been supportive of Jenner’s transition, particularly Kim, although they were upset when Jenner excluded them from her first TV interview with Diane Sawyer two years ago. Jenner thought including the Kardashians would make the whole thing look like a “big joke”, so used the adult children from her first two families instead.
Since then, there has been no stopping her. She has become assertive on the issue of women’s rights, realising that, “in so many cases, women underestimate their power. They’ve been brainwashed growing up, being the girl, they’re supposed to be in the background and all that stuff. I don’t see that. I didn’t come to womanhood that way, by sitting in the back. OK?” As a result, she says, “I like to encourage women to be more powerful and stand up for yourself.”
I suggest that Jenner’s assertiveness as a woman is partly rooted in having lived her life to the age of 65 as a beneficiary of male privilege.
“Yeah!” she says cheerfully. “I would agree with that. I know the other side. I’ve been there all my life. But I want to use that to my advantage.” This is so honest, I’m somewhat taken aback. She goes on, “Some of the criticism that my community has had is that I’m white, I’ve got money, I’m privileged and all that kind of stuff. I get that. OK? Can’t do much about being white. Kind of born that way. Privileged? Yeah. I’ve worked hard all my life. I’ve tried to be as smart as I can and yeah, I’ve been successful from that standpoint. And I’m not going to apologise for that.” She chuckles. “Not even close.”
“Um. Yes. I’ve always been with other women. I think I say in the book that if I were to go through gender confirmation, I don’t know what my future would be.” I ask if the word lesbian – which I sense is problematic for Jenner – is appropriate and she seems to think I’m asking her whether, before her transition, she was attracted to men and says, rather quickly, “sexually, I was heterosexual. Was that a high priority – in what the public perceived to be this male, Olympic stud? Not even close.”
I mention all this because for the second half of our interview, it feels to me as if I’m interacting with an ego that, to use the language Jenner herself eschews, has been thoroughly socialised as male, to the extent that – and I apologise for this – after the interview, I inadvertently refer to her with the male pronoun, having to that point, and as is correct, referred to her exclusively as “she”. This does not undermine her journey, or the journey of any other trans person. But after hanging out with Jenner, it is impossible to avoid the sense that she is still deeply vested in the spoils that came to her as a result of the outward signifiers of her pretransition life.
Anyway, she says, she is not interested in sex. “I’m more excited about fighting battles for our community than I am about going out on a date.” Poor old community. It’s impossible to tell if Jenner does more harm than good, but if we are all, at this point, permitted to be the sole determinants of our own identities, then Jenner has the right to define herself precisely as she pleases. “It was hard giving old Bruce up, in a lot of ways,” she says. “He still lives inside me. I still do a lot of the things old Bruce used to do. I still fly airplanes and go race cars once in a while. I can have the best of both worlds.” She bestows on me her most dazzling smile. “I can live my life authentically, and still do all the fun stuff!”
It is possible that the victims knew their assailant, as the condominium had tight security and there was a “message of retribution” written on a wall of the apartment, the Boston Globe reported.
Bolanos, 38, was a pediatric anesthesiologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, according to its website, and an instructor at Harvard Medical School. Field, 49, also an anesthesiologist, worked at North Shore Pain Management.
Police had gone to the building on a report of a man with a gun. Police commissioner William Evans said the suspect opened fire when officers confronted him at the door. He said police fired back and hit the man several times.
After the shootings, the suspect was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The officers were not hurt.
Authorities expect to file multiple charges against 30-year-old Bampumim Teixeira, of Chelsea. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday. The Suffolk county district attorney’s office said Teixeira has a pair of larceny convictions on his record. In June of last year, Teixeira passed a note demanding money at a Boston bank. He committed the same crime two years earlier.
The office did not know on Sunday if he had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk district attorney Daniel Conley, said he did not know what charges Teixeira would face, but Evans told local media that two murder charges were likely.
On its Facebook page, North Shore Pain Management called Field “instrumental in the creation of this practice” and that his death “leaves an inescapable void in all of us”.
Bolanos’ godfather, Michael Gibbs, told The Boston Globe that she and Field were “good, kind, gentle people”.
“Hopefully, this guy that they caught will be able to say who he is and why this was done,” Gibbs said. “That’s all we’re hoping, is to get some kind of information. Why did this happen?”
On behalf of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, chief executive John Fernandez expressed sadness over the deaths of both doctors.
“The entire Mass. Eye and Ear community is deeply saddened by the deaths of Dr. Lina Bolanos and her fiance,” he said on the practice’s website. “Dr Bolanos was an outstanding pediatric anesthesiologist and a wonderful colleague in the prime of both her career and life.”

Africa is home to 1.2 billion people, but by 2050 that number is likely to double, and may well double again by the end of the century to reach well over 4 billion. Globally, we may exceed 11 billion souls. This is of course a cause for celebration and a testament to the huge strides we’ve made in public health. We’ve all but beaten polio and yellow fever, mother and child mortality has plummeted, and we’re making headway in the fight against malaria.
Another cause for celebration is the confidence, energy and entrepreneurship in many parts of the African continent – a spirit that is unmatched anywhere in the world. It’s easy to see we’re on the cusp of enormous positive change.
The obvious flipside is the environmental disaster waiting to happen. This has been compounded by number crunchers who are leaving the future of our planet’s fragile ecosystems out of the equation as they try to come up with answers about how to fill billions of bellies. Several scenarios for cropland expansion – many of them focusing on Africa’s so-called “spare land” – have already effectively written off its elephants from having a future in the wild.
These projections have earmarked a huge swathe of land spanning from Nigeria to South Sudan for farming, or parts of west Africa for conversion to palm oil plantations. Economies are already being structured for the future, and are locking us into an unsustainable path to the tune of Feed the World – but with Africa providing the food.
But we can change this trajectory if we act now on three clear solutions – and even bring about a win-win scenario in which Africa’s future generations come out on top thanks to healthy ecosystems.
The first is better land-use planning; setting clear boundaries and limits on urban development and farming. The benefit here is that when constrained, we innovate. Land use becomes more considered and more efficient.
The second is agricultural yield – looking at food production in the sub-Saharan region and comparing it to, for example, the European Union, we can clearly see room for huge gains. With the right investment, yields could potentially double. Better choices and technology will remove the temptation simply to plough more land.
We have to see conservation not as a cost or a burden, but rather as an investment in our own survival
Third, we need conservation areas that generate tangible benefits for the people who live alongside wildlife, creating real, localised green economies that can secure local buy-in. Namibia has made great strides in providing for community-owned land outside national parks, while Kenya’s recent conservancies law creates a more robust framework for communities to protect and profit.
Most of all, we have to see conservation not as a cost or a burden, but rather as a business opportunity and an investment in our own survival. This is an argument I’ve carried with me into climate negotiations, where for years we’ve been disagreeing about who should foot the bill. At last we’re beginning to see an inclusive green economy and a shift to technologies like renewables as a bounty. These changes can be drivers of a better quality of life, better paid jobs, and a growth potential of decades.
Human wellbeing and the survival of our ecosystems are inextricably linked. The health of Africa’s elephants – a keystone species upon which countless others depend – serves as a barometer of not just the state of the environment, but also our prospects as a species. Simply put, we need to secure the space for both.

“I don’t read the newspapers. I don’t have a television at home. I barely knew who Donald Trump was,” Li said during an interview at his agent’s 14-floor studio in a high-rise called Golden Triangle.
Li’s career as a Trump impersonator is still in its infancy; following his debut in Shenzhen he travelled to the nearby city of Zhongshan to perform at the opening of a lighting store and recorded a commercial for a tea company in his home province of Hunan.
Like Trump, Li is a master of bluster and bravado although his is delivered in a thick Hunanese accent. “[I’m] no ordinary person now. I’m a great man... I’m an internet celebrity now!” he boasts.
Ren Shihe, a impressionist from Xi’an who has spent three decades playing everyone from Leonid Brezhnev to Saddam Hussein, said he charged up to 30,000 yuan (£3,400) per appearance.
Zou Danrong, Li’s BMW-driving agent, admitted his Chinese Trump was still a work in progress. In a bid to make his black-haired apprentice more convincing he was trying to teach him to be more effeminate, like the real-life Trump, and planned to buy him some blue contact lenses.
 A well-known talent agent, Zou already represents a range of world leaders including a Kim Jong-un from Hebei province; a Barack Obama from Guangdong and a Vladimir Putin from Anhui.
“In the US people are free to protest and to hold Trump’s photograph upside down. In China no one would dare to do this,” he added. “That’s politics.”

They are blaming Simon Mayo for 'normalising' drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus
Yes, obviously the DJs mentioned booze loads and repeatedly implied that it was fine and nice. As Northumbria’s associate professor of public health and wellbeing put it: “Alcohol consumption is often portrayed as the norm without negative consequences, and just 5% of references on all stations were about sensible drinking.” That’s a lot more discussion of sensible drinking than I would’ve expected.
This is a bit of a soft target, you might think. Leave the guys at Northumbria University alone. If they can get funding for counting the number of times Steve Wright mentions Lambrusco, maybe I should wish them luck. But I don’t. Because it’s another case of people scrutinising how other people talk and vetting them for inadvertent divergences from an approved value system. A mild case, perhaps – these guys aren’t no-platforming Peter Tatchell – but they are blaming Simon Mayo for “normalising” drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus. The study will probably be ignored but, in these inane times, you just can’t be completely sure.
So it might be worth saying something obvious: DJs on the radio have to talk like human beings – the specific human beings they happen to be. That’s the premise of this form of entertainment: natural chat interspersed with music. It’s not high culture but it passes the time in heavy traffic.
But it won’t work if the people at the microphone, desperately trying to keep the energy up, also have to reflect some externally imposed consensus of how life should be lived. That’s Thought for the Day, which is scripted in advance and lasts under three minutes. Any longer than that and it really would drive listeners to drink…
Losing your navigational skills or getting lost even though you are in a familiar setting may provide some of the first indications that Alzheimer’s disease could affect you in later life. This is a preliminary discovery of a remarkable long-term study being carried out by scientists who are searching to uncover how dementia first affects the brain.
The Prevent project – based at Edinburgh University, though it involves several other UK research centres – is intended to detect signs of Alzheimer’s in people while they are still relatively young. Usually, the disease does not show its symptoms until individuals are in their 60s, by which time it has already done profound damage to the brain.
“Alzheimer’s is considered to be a disease of memory but we now think from our early work that the difficulty people are really having – at least to begin with – is not to do with declining memories but to do with their declining ability to visualise the location of objects or themselves,” said Karen Ritchie, one of the researchers. “They are losing their ability to navigate.”
The project – funded by the Alzheimer’s Society – involves the study of two groups. The first consists of people aged 41 to 59 with close relatives who have developed Alzheimer’s and who are considered to be at relatively high risk. The second is made up of individuals whose lives have not been touched by the disease.
The Four Mountains test developed by Cambridge University neuroscientist Dennis Chan is a key ingredient. It involves showing people a picture of a mountain and asking them to identify it in a selection of four other landscapes. There is considerable variation in ability and it provides scientists with a powerful tool to pinpoint those suffering hippocampal degradation. “At present we use computer screens to administer the test but in future we plan to use virtual reality headsets,” said Ritchie.
Cate Latto, who volunteered to take part, feels that loss of navigational ability reflected an important symptom of Alzheimer’s. “My mother developed the disease in late life but even when she was relatively young she could never remember where she put her car keys or where she left her car. As children, we spent our lives hunting through car parks trying to find where she had left it.”
It remains to be seen how effective tests based on measuring navigational prowess will be in predicting who will develop Alzheimer’s in later life. It would also raise ethical issues. If there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer’s why pinpoint those at risk in middle age? What could be gained?
There are several answers, say scientists. Drugs that are currently ineffective may prove far more potent if given during the disease’s early stages. In addition, it is now known that regular exercise, healthy eating and giving up smoking – which improves cardiovascular health – can also help. “There are life-style changes that can help reduce the risk of the disease,” said Ritchie.
The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Hak Song had worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before he was held on Saturday.
“A relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes,” the KCNA said.
Kim Sang Duk was arrested at the Pyongyang International Airport on 22 April, the KCNA said. It said he was “intercepted for committing criminal acts” to overthrow the North’s government, but didn’t elaborate.
On Sunday, the KCNA did not say whether the two cases were connected.
In Washington, the state department said it was aware of the report of the new detention and that “the security of US citizens is one of the department’s highest priorities”.
Kim Hak Song and Kim Sang Duk are among at least four Americans being detained in North Korea, as tensions between the two countries continue.
The others are Otto Warmbier, who is serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor for alleged anti-state acts, and Kim Dong Chul, serving a 10-year term with hard labor for alleged espionage.
Washington, Seoul and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, which in recent years have involved high-profile American missions sent to secure releases.
When an American citizen is reported detained, the US works with the Swedish embassy in the North Korean capital, since the US and the North do not have diplomatic relations.
The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is the only privately funded university in North Korea and is unique for having a large number of foreign staff.
This month sees the 20th anniversary of the granting by New Labour of independence to the Bank of England.
It was not full-scale independence but “operational independence” in monetary policy: that is, the freedom to change interest rates without having to consult the chancellor. The Bank is still the Treasury’s agent in other matters, such as decisions about the nation’s currency reserves.
The Strand Group at King’s College London held a high-powered conference to mark Bank independence last week: but against the background of elections and all this Brexit nonsense, the anniversary of what was a controversial event at the time seems to have passed non-aficionados by.
I myself was against the move at the time, and while hardly anyone questions the idea now, I am still inclined to take the Zhou Enlai view. This is a reference to then Chinese premier’s reply in the 1970s when he was asked what he thought the consequences of the French Revolution had been. He famously replied: “Too early to tell.” This has gone down in fake history as a witty reference to the events of 1789, but an official who was present said Zhou was actually referring to the riots in Paris in 1968.
Even critics of Gordon Brown give him, and his economic adviser at the time, Ed Balls, credit for making the Bank independent in this area.
It is noteworthy, however, that most of the Brexiters who go on about parliamentary sovereignty seem to have no qualms about placing decisions in the hands of unelected officials.
The granting of independence was the final resort of British policymakers in the long, and losing, battle for Labour and Tories alike to control inflation. Both parties had problems with incomes policies in the 1970s. The Tories brought monetarism from 1979, but that failed – indeed, the doctrine was even subsequently disowned by Milton Friedman, its most prominent advocate. Then came Chancellor Lawson’s obsession with the success of the Germans in controlling inflation; his instrument was to be membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. When Margaret Thatcher vetoed that, Lawson directed the Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market so that the pound “shadowed” the Deutschmark.
When he was rumbled, there was hell to pay, ending with Lawson’s dramatic resignation in 1989. Ironically, after Lawson went, Thatcher was finally worn down a year later, and the pound joined the ERM in 1990.
Membership of the ERM then ended in sterling’s ignominious exit from the mechanism on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. Amazingly, the British establishment did not seem to be aware of what the Germans knew only too well: namely that the historic reunification of Germany at around the time we joined the ERM would have serious inflationary consequences, because of the massive cost of absorbing the run-down East German economy. It was exactly the wrong time to subject Britain to what was effectively German monetary policy.
John Major was prime minister, and he took the rap. Now, although some fanatics had been trying to reverse the result of the 1975 referendum (a two-to-one verdict in favour of remaining in the EEC we had joined in 1973) from the start, we can really date the onset of the cancerous growth of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party to the early 1990s. The general election of 1992 saw the end of the dominance of pro-Europeans in the parliamentary party and the rise of what the beleaguered Major termed the Eurosceptic “bastards”.
Meanwhile, after the ERM, the next supposed panacea for British inflation was central bank independence. While this period has coincided with low inflation, it has not necessarily caused it. Most industrial countries have had low inflation in recent times.
However, central bank independence is but a sideshow when it comes to the major economic crisis of our times, which is the prospect of Brexit.
Well, it is an open question whether the poison has been neutralised. Quite apart from that, we are in the lamentable position where a Tory party that used to have the national interest at heart is now sacrificing everything to its own preservation. Yes: thanks to Theresa May’s lame acceptance of the result of a referendum conducted on a false prospectus, the poison has now spread to the nation at large.
We have a government that really is, in Angela Merkel’s word, “delusional” about squaring the circle: obsessed by the immigration she failed to control at the Home Office, May wishes to leave the customs union and the single market while cherrypicking her way back into the best bits. This is impossible. As often happens, the people running this country do not seem to realise that our continental partners have their own interests, and tend to say what they mean.
It is not too late to rethink. My old friend Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, says that it is not irrevocable. It is reversible. There is still an opportunity for our leaders to see sense, and own up to the people.
I know the people have spoken. They spoke in 1945 and said one thing, and in 1951 and said another. Throughout the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, they said one thing, and then another. To coin a phrase: it is a people’s privilege to change its mind.
“I want teams to be worried that they have drawn Argentina,” he said, adding that, if his players were where he intended them to be come the World Cup, it would not matter whom they were up against, not that he will be dancing a jig if the Pumas find themselves facing the All Blacks again. As they are ninth in the rankings, they could be pooled with the holders, New Zealand, and their Rugby Championship rivals South Africa, whose annus horribilis in 2016 led to them slipping out of the top four.
Although 20 countries will take part in the World Cup, there will be only 12 names in the draw: the teams that finished in the top three of their groups in 2015. They have been split into three groups according to their position in the rankings: New Zealand, England, Australia and Ireland occupy the first tier, meaning they will avoid each other; then come Scotland, France, South Africa and Wales; and Argentina, Japan, Georgia and Italy form the third wave.
The other eight teams will be decided after qualifying matches in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Whoever draws Argentina could land Fiji, who were the other victims in England’s pool in 2015, Samoa or Tonga; or two of them.
Akira Shimazu, president of the tournament’s organising committee, has said: “Japan is preparing to welcome the world. We are committed to Rugby World Cup and we’re aiming to deliver the best yet. It will be a celebration of rugby and of Japanese culture as we will show off the best of our country and our hospitality on a global stage. The last World Cup was a great success but our task is not to emulate England but to make it a very Japanese event.”
Before the draw World Rugby will debate extending the residential qualification period for Test players. It is currently three years, but member unions are set to agree a recommendation to increase it to five. The change would not be retrospective and would not prevent the Sale wing Denny Solomona, who recently became available for England under the three-year rule, from touring Argentina with Eddie Jones’s side next month.
“This is my first season and I found a lot of situations, a lot of players. Pochettino has been working there for three years and has changed a lot of players, and is working very well. For me Tottenham are a really strong team and it’s normal to see them fighting for the title.
“But if you consider the squads, the numbers in each squad, you can see the difference: one team prepared to play the Champions League with 25 or 26 players, and another prepared to play only the league, the FA Cup and the League Cup. My expectation was a great challenge in this league against Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool. Next season for us it will be the same. But we have one year to work and then the possibility to go into the market and choose the right players on my idea of football.”
The prospect of Conte adding an entirely new spine to the side is very real. “We are building,” he added. “We started to build this season. If we are able to win, it’s a great achievement for us. When you start to build, it’s very difficult to carry on winning. This is a process. No one thought Chelsea could fight to win the title and be in the FA Cup final this season.
“For sure, we are in a moment of transition. We are losing a lot of top players who have written the story, the history, of this club. This season we lost Branislav Ivanovic, we lost Mikel John Obi and next season we’ll have lost John [Terry]: three big players. Don’t forget Oscar, who went in the transfer market when we sold him.
“But don’t forget we are building to try and create a good foundation to support not only for the next season, but for many years, and to make sure Chelsea stay always in and fight for the Champions League. To try and win the Champions League and the title.”
Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.

This film inflates Fassbender’s robot role hugely. He first appears in an eerie, interesting opening sequence which the rest of the film cannot really match: a huge white room, with a grand piano, a panorama-window showing some generic alpine landscape, a full-scale model of Michelangelo’s David, and other high-art objects. There we find Fassbender’s robot being questioned by his testy scientist-creator Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and invited to choose a name for himself, the robot hubristically says David, after the statue.
Should they chance everything by going down and taking a look? Should they, much more to the point, walk around down there without their protective helmets and spacesuits on, so that evil spores from little pod-like growths can get into their ear canals and up their noses? Have these people learned nothing at all?
Just as in Prometheus, the action is opened out from the claustrophobic confines of the spaceship to the vast prospects of a distant planet, which turns out to be a mix of Pompeii and Easter Island. There is a wonderful long shot of the explorers in the darkness of this planet, the tiny green beams of their torches darting around them.
Instead, the paper went with images of Prince Harry kissing his girlfriend and a story about insurance companies being unscrupulous.
Macron’s victory did make it onto the front of the Daily Telegraph, but the historic news was presented solely in relation to how it could impact Britain’s exit from the EU. The paper’s page one headline made no mention of the far-right candidate being beaten by centrist Macron and instead warned that his victory “puts cloud over Brexit”.
It was a sentiment echoed – albeit via far fewer column inches – by the Mirror.
Elsewhere, the Times and Financial Times played it pretty straight. The Times lauded a “landslide for Macron”, while the FT announced “Macron sweeps to victory” as French voters opted for “globalism over populism”.
With The Sun silent on the result, it was left to the Metro to inject a bit of fun and come up with what is arguably the best pun of the day.
Going through therapy yourself does not make you a therapist and while I certainly agree that challenging circumstances give you experience and sometimes wisdom to share, they don’t turn you into a miracle worker. You both had a lot to contend with early in your union and should be grateful and proud that you’ve managed to negotiate your way through such difficulties and remain together. The loss of a child is a terrible trauma, unimaginable to those who haven’t endured it, and it’s rare for the relationship of two bereaved parents to emerge completely unscathed.
Finding yourselves the victim of a misfortune that feels so personal changes the way you relate to the world and can easily trigger a sense of isolation and anger towards even those sharing in the grief. I’m not condoning your husband’s cruelty toward you, especially if it was physical or intimidating, but you don’t share details so I can’t judge beyond saying it’s good news that those days are now behind you.
I suspect your husband struggled harder in the aftermath of losing your child because he lacked the vocabulary to express the complex emotions and misery he was feeling, something your six years of therapy won’t have protected you from, but may have helped you to negotiate more successfully.
The greatest issue you face is your belief that the man your husband has become is entirely down to you
Adversity can forge stronger bonds or force you apart, and at present you’re occupying what sounds like a bearable middle ground. My sense is that the greatest issue you face is your belief that the man your husband has become is entirely down to your tender, supportive nursing and nothing to do with his own personal choice and struggle.
You appear to underestimate how difficult depression coupled with the anger of such bereavement would be to recover from, which is odd, as you yourself will have gone through many of the same complex emotions.
Imagining it’s all down to you is unhelpful for both of you. It means you undervalue his own role in his rehabilitation and create in yourself this sense of insecurity that he’s simply slipped on a new skin he could easily shed. Give him credit where it’s due for transforming himself into a man you can love and rely on, rather than one who inspires fear and insecurity.
Your early therapy will have given you an emotional grounding that perhaps made you less vulnerable to later trauma. Losing a child is an awful thing to happen at any point, but it’s certainly guaranteed to rock the foundations of a newly formed romantic liaison.
Now, 40 years down the line you have invested a lot in staying together and improving the quality of your communication, but you have to accept your husband has done some heavy lifting, too.
Instead of fretting that he may simply revert to type, and become ‘angry at the world again’ or dwelling on how he once was, how about giving him credit for his achievement in overcoming grief and depression and emerging a better man and a loving husband?
Sometimes the only way to solve a problem is to change the view. Seen from a different perspective, your husband has gone through a major metamorphosis that he must have fought hard to bring to fruition. The man he once was is not the man he has become. You have to gauge how you feel about him right now, not based on past history, and the first step would be to give him credit for his large role in the welcome transformation. Four decades together is a big investment to squander without compelling cause.
Minutes before the legally enforced ending of the campaign, Macron’s movement issued a statement warning about a “massive hacking attack”. En Marche! explained that these documents had been hacked over a period of several weeks, that some of them were genuine and without any compromising content. Other documents in the data trove, however, appeared to have been fabricated.
Macron had already become, by far, the most targeted candidate by hackers during the campaign. In February, his movement’s computer systems were attacked by hackers based in Ukraine and needed to be shut down for several hours.
The timing is evidently aimed at bringing chaos to the last hours of the French campaign, but it is doubtful that the Macron leaks will have a real impact on the final result.
First of all, they are not a real surprise. French voters have already heard and read about the similar hacking attacks in France and other countries, notably during the US elections. And the spreading of fake news has become commonplace in France too.
Secondly, at first glance, no huge or obvious scandal seems to arise from the leak: journalists and experts will need months to properly study the content.
For months French voters have been living through a campaign full of twists and turns, violence and divisions. Families, friends and colleagues are divided and will remain so for some time
This latest attack is probably too obvious to substantially alter the result on Sunday and in fact, it might have the opposite effect from what the hackers had hoped for. This clear attempt to influence the democratic process might in fact convince some voters to turn up who had originally planned to abstain.
A fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine, the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences, and the European College of Sport Science, Jones is also special adviser (endurance) to the English Institute of Sport.
“When you’re at the Monza Formula One track, you talk to the top people at Mercedes and they say the tweaks they’re making to their F1 cars will eventually filter down and become standard in their regular road cars. I think it’s the same sort of thing with running. You can only understand normal physiology if you can understand perfect physiology.”
So what is it about their physiology that has allowed African runners to dominate distance running so comprehensively in recent years? “Their body types tend to be smaller and naturally leaner,” Jones said. “Their limbs have slightly different proportions, which make them run more efficiently. They have slightly longer shanks; their lower legs tend to be relatively long compared to their thighs, they don’t tend to carry a lot of muscle on their calves and they have quite long achilles, which can be quite advantageous. Their V02 Max [maximum oxygen uptake] may not be much higher than what you’d find in a good class of distance runner in the UK, but they’re much more economical and they’re able to operate at high fractions of their max almost without fatigue.”
Those who can’t abide the idea of drinking the distinctive juice will be relieved to learn there are alternatives.
“A whole load of leafy green vegetables – rocket, lettuces and spinach – are rich in inorganic nitrate that our bodies convert into nitric oxide,” said Jones, who suggested that consuming such vegetables regularly might mean runners did not need to take nitrate supplements.
“My experience from visiting Kenya is that the runners eat a lot of stewed spinach and so maybe their dietary nitrate content is pretty high compared with what we consume. Arguably they may benefit less from nitrate as a supplement because they already have a lot of it in their daily diet.” Runners of all levels can benefit from taking another legal substance, too, Jones suggested.
But no amount of supplements can make up for poor fuelling. “The ability to run fast for long periods depends on how much carbohydrate you can use. You can only store a certain amount in your muscles and therefore getting as much on board exogenously – ie through food and drink – as you run is really important. It’s a real skill and a lot of athletes don’t practise it enough.
“If you try to do it on race day and you are not used to it you will probably have stomach problems and you may find it unpalatable. So we’ve been doing our best to really increase the amount of carbohydrate in the beverages and gels that they take and feed it to them a bit more frequently than in a conventional marathon.
“In the marathon, it’s usually only every 5k [they take on fuel] and if you need to drink 100ml or 200ml of fluid, that’s quite a lot to take on board. If you can take 50ml, 60ml or 70ml every two and a half kilometres then that’s much easier to manage. But you have to make sure the athlete has trained their digestive system, so we’ve had them concentrating hard on that in their training runs in Africa.”
Having spent time with the runners on their home turf, Jones believes he has learned as much from them as they did from him. One eye-opener was the way they approached training.
“Runners will typically do a bunch of medium runs at a steady pace and a long run, say, on a Sunday at a slightly slower speed, and then a couple of interval training sessions. That’s grown out of [Percy] Cerutty and [Arthur] Lydiard [two respected antipodean running coaches] and that’s what people do in the US and all across Europe.
“But in Africa it’s somewhat different. When they go for most of their runs they’re quite slow, but when they do their long run – 22 to 25 miles is not uncommon – they’ll run those sessions quite fast. They might start easily but it will get progressively faster and faster and it’s almost a case of the last man standing. It’s a very specific form of training that we don’t expose ourselves to.”
Rest is another clear point of demarcation between runners in Africa and the west, said Jones.
“They go to bed when the sun goes down and they get up when the sun comes up and often go out and run immediately. For the remainder of the day they chill out. They don’t seem stressed about doing chores or going on social media. They switch off, relax, chat with their friends over a cup of tea. That doesn’t mean they’re any less serious about their training but they do take their recovery very seriously.”
This is something Jones wishes he could have told his younger record-breaking self.
“I think I’d tell myself to do a bit less training. If you look at the Kenyans, they really listen to their bodies. In the western world we are very regimented about our training. We structure it really precisely and we get anxious about it too much. We’re obsessed with running our intervals in precisely the same time. What you get in Africa, and Kenya in particular, it’s much more relaxed. They listen to their bodies and they back off when they need to.”
Despite Kipchoge’s phenomenal performance, some will view , record breaking performance as nothing more than a Nike marketing gimmick. But Jones believes that running is richer for what was achieved at Monza and that the challenge, not just to achieve a “sub-2” marathon, but for everyone to run further and faster, has been thrown down.
“I hope people have been really inspired and motivated by it. It’s been about working out what are the limits of human performance. It’s only when you know what they are that you can work on strategies to overcome them.”
Out of Africa: what everyday runners can learn from the elite
In the west we are very regimented about our training. We get anxious about it. In Africa it's much more relaxed
She now has the right to live and work in the UK permanently after Brexit, irrespective of the outcome of negotiations between Brussels and London.
She swore allegiance to the Queen and completed a “life in the UK” test to prove she was assimilating into British culture, even though she is bilingual, has lived in the country for most of her adult life and is married to a British man with whom she has two British children.
Hawkins, like other EU nationals receiving British citizenship, was handed a standard letter from the home secretary congratulating her on her new status. In a sign of the struggle the Home Office is facing dealing with the volume of applications from EU citizens, the letter was signed by Theresa May, who stepped down as home secretary when she became prime minister almost a year ago.
“I am delighted to finally be British, having felt part of this wonderful and beautiful country for many years now,” said Hawkins. “The ceremony was quick, it felt odd. I have very mixed emotions about it.”
It was a bittersweet moment for the IT consultant. She no longer has to worry about her status post-Brexit but, on the downside, she has learned that she has lost several rights conferred under EU freedom of movement laws.
“Some time after submitting my application in January, I was horrified to learn from a lawyer that in fact by becoming a dual-national British citizen, I have signed away several rights that I had before,” she said.
The first thing Hawkins did following the citizenship ceremony was register to vote in the general election, something that EU citizens are not eligible to do, bar the Irish, Maltese and citizens of the Republic of Cyprus. She said she was “especially pleased” to be able to vote in an election that would affect the future of the three million EU citizens living in the UK.
She said she was concerned about other EU citizens who, after the referendum, discovered they were not entitled to be here because they were caring for a disabled child; were stay-at-home parents; or students who were not notified by the Home Office or their universities that they were required to have private health insurance to stay. “These are the people I worry about, that is what keeps me awake at night,” Hawkins said.
 She has been asked to speak at at an event organised by the Dutch MEP Sophie in ’t Veld, who set up the parliament’s task force in January to look into the rights of people and families affected by Brexit.
Last December, Hawkins described her treatment by the Home Office as being as “absurd as a Monty Python sketch”.
She had sent officials an 85-page permanent residency application along with documents such as historic employment records, council tax statements and proof of absences from the country. However, the Home Office refused her application on the grounds that she had sent in a notarised copy of her passport rather than her original, which she needed for travelling to the Netherlands to handle the paperwork generated by the death of her father.
“As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom, you should now make arrangements to leave,” the rejection letter stated.
Meanwhile, almost 30 employers, including PwC, the Metropolitan police and the London fire brigade, have signed up to a campaign aimed at helping staff with the cost of renting in London. Many are offering loans to cover the cost of deposits, which now average £1,756 in the capital, according to the Deposit Protection Service. Others are finding different ways to give staff a helping hand, ranging from a couple of weeks of free rent to preferential mortgage rates for those trying to buy.
However, it appears companies in other sectors are coming to realise that they also need to play their part in tackling the housing crisis. Employers in London and the south-east are increasingly complaining that soaring house prices and rents are making it difficult to recruit and keep hold of talented staff, with younger people in particular being priced out.
With this in mind, the Book Trade Charity recently merged with an organisation that has more than 20 flats in Whetstone in the London borough of Barnet, and earlier this year Hachette made a donation that will help fund the complete refurbishment of a block of six flats. This work is due to be finished by September, which is when the first wave of successful applicants for the company’s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) trainee programme are due to begin their 12-month paid internships. These trainees – and potentially other applicants – will be offered the chance to live in one of the furnished flats. Hachette did not wish to disclose the rent, but says it is “considerably below” market value (a one-bed flat in the N20 postcode is around £242 a week).
The company says the trainees will be offered the accommodation for six months, though adds: “I am sure we will review the arrangement in each case, and it may be that if there is room and someone wants to stay, then they can. But the point of the scheme is to get people started, and we will want to help as many as we can to find their feet … If we have more flats than we have trainees, we would offer it more widely.”
The trainees, who will be paid what is described as an “entry-level” salary, will be commuting to the company’s base in Blackfriars in central London. This shouldn’t be a problem as trains from New Southgate (a 15-minute walk away) take 25 minutes to get to Moorgate, and there are also Northern and Piccadilly line tube stations about 15 minutes’ walk away.
The point of the scheme is to get people started, and we will want to help as many as we can to find their feet
Last month Penguin Random House announced its own link-up with the Book Trade Charity, which is based near Kings Langley in Hertfordshire and operates a number of properties that mainly cater for older people who used to work in the industry. London-based Penguin offers 450 work experience placements every year, which typically run for two weeks, and says it wanted to do something to help those young people coming from outside the capital who might otherwise have difficulty finding somewhere to stay.
In return for a donation to the charity, the company is taking on one of the recently refurbished bungalows at the site for an initial six months, and will then nominate the people who will take turns renting it for two-week periods. They will pay what is described as “a very, very subsidised rent”, and trains from nearby Kings Langley to London Euston take 25 minutes. Penguin also stresses that all those on its work experience programme will receive a salary of £262.50 a week.
Spool back 100 years or more and philanthropic Victorian businessmen such as George Cadbury were busy creating “model villages” and estates for their employees that remain thriving communities today.
“Years of pay restraint and stressful working conditions are taking their toll,” said Chris Hopson, NHS Providers’ chief executive. “Pay is becoming uncompetitive. Significant numbers of trusts say lower paid staff are leaving to stack shelves in supermarkets rather than carry on with the NHS.”
“Pay restraint must end and politicians must therefore be clear about when during the lifetime of the next parliament it will happen and how.” He repeated the organisation’s demand for £25bn in extra funding to help the NHS in England get through until 2020 and warned that staff are also leaving because they are exhausted from having to work so constantly to keep up with the unprecedented demand for care.
Hopson added: “We are getting consistent reports of retention problems because of working pressures in the health service causing stress and burnout.”
“Is that enough considering the brilliant work that they do? I think many people would say they want to pay them more. I think they do an incredible job. If you want more money to go into the NHS – and this government recognises we will need to put more money into the NHS and the social care system because of the pressures we face – then the question is how you get there,” said Hunt.
Responding to Hopson’s comments on NHS pay, Ashworth added: “This is a stark warning from NHS Providers about the Conservatives’ catastrophic management of the NHS workforce. It is incredible and disgraceful that NHS staff are leaving to work in supermarkets instead because NHS pay has been squeezed so far. The country’s shortage of paramedics, nurses and consultants now threatens a raft of NHS strategies to provide better services for patients.”
NHS Providers are also warning that understaffing is so serious in mental health services that patients are now suffering delays in receiving treatment, taking longer to recover and having a bad experience of NHS care. “We are particularly worried about the pressures in the mental health workforce,” said Hopson. “These are resulting in delays in treatment, people are taking longer to recover, and as a result their care is more expensive and their experience is worse.”
She in turn called the former economy minister an arrogant, spoilt, cold-eyed, “smirking banker” who was colluding with Islamists, complacent on terrorism and intent on “butchering France” in favour of “big economic interests”.
Both accused the other of taking French people for imbeciles. At one point, after a long attack saying Le Pen was lying to the French public, Macron snapped: “I’m sorry, Madame Le Pen; France deserves better than you.”
Snap polling by Elabe for BFM television just after Le Pen had left the TV studios, accusing Macron of “lies and aggression”, found that a clear majority felt the centrist candidate had been the most convincing. Viewing figures said 16 .5 million people watched the debate.
French media on Thursday declared Macron the winner of a “dirty debate”. Le Pen was criticised for her “permanent aggression” and even normally sympathetic publications found her “unconvincing”.
Libération accused Le Pen of “multiplying attacks and provocations … and thus avoiding any serious debate” while Ruth Elkrief, political editor for BFMTV declared it “not worthy of a presidential election campaign”.
On jobs – one of the biggest concerns in a country that has struggled with decades of mass unemployment — Macron told Le Pen: “Your strategy is simply to tell a lot of lies and just to say what isn’t going right in the country.” She said he favoured “uncontrolled globalisation” and would sell off state assets to the highest bidder.
Although Le Pen was under pressure to flesh out her policy proposals, she spent more time attacking Macron and the record of the outgoing Socialist government.
Terrorism was another key issue after a series of deadly attacks killed more than 230 people in France in just over two years. Le Pen accused Macron of an “indulgent attitude” towards Islamic fundamentalism and said he was slack on fighting extremism. He replied he would be “uncompromising” on terrorism – which he called the biggest issue of the next few years in France – and said the state had to look at the social issues behind why so many terrorists who attacked France were born and raised in France. Le Pen, who this week said “globalisation and Islamism” were the main threats to France, retorted that Macron was lax on Islamism and disregarded French secularism.
Le Pen restated her plan to ban religious symbols from all public places, which would include the Muslim headscarf. Macron warned that her proposals would divide France and lead to “a civil war” and “that’s what terrorists want”. He said: “The terrorists want there to be divisions between us” and accusing his rival of “hate-filled speech”.
On the European Union, the candidates could not have been further apart. Le Pen, who wants to hold a referendum on France leaving the EU, and Macron, who wants closer cooperation, traded more insults on the subject. Le Pen said Macron as president would allow France to be crushed by its economically powerful neighbour Germany and would “lie prostrate” before the powers of Berlin.
“France will be led by a woman, either me or Mrs Merkel,” Le Pen laughed, referring to the German chancellor. He meanwhile attacked her over her muddled stance on the euro. “The euro is the currency of bankers. It’s not the people’s currency,” Le Pen snapped back. Macron responded: “The euro is important. It’s not just a policy.”
Polls this week conducted before the TV debate showed Macron leading by 60% to 40% before the final-round vote on Sunday.
The stage-managed live TV sparring-match is a staple of French election campaigns. The format, in which the candidates face each other across a table for the cameras with no studio audience, has not changed for 40 years. But this bad-tempered exchange, which saw Macron and Le Pen repeatedly exchange insults with rather than expounding on policy, represented a political first.
After France’s two main parties, who had shared power for decades, were knocked out in the first-round vote last month amid anti-establishment anger, the two candidates who faced each other across the table were relative political novices.
The very fact that Le Pen appeared in the debate was considered a major step in normalising her party. In 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the final, the right-wing Jacques Chirac refused to debate him on TV for fear of “normalising hate and intolerance”.
Le Pen has tried to gain a grassroots presence across France and soften her party’s image, attempting to shake off the old jackbooted image of anti-semitism and racism under her Holocaust-denying father, but Macron in rallies has continually described her party as the “party of hatred”.
He said she lacked any knowledge of facts and was “feeding off” French people’s unhappiness. He said she was a “parasite” on the system that she was criticising, manipulating voters’ woes. “What class!” she interjected witheringly.
Le Pen wants a France with closed borders and to prioritise French people over foreigners for jobs, housing and benefits, to send illegal immigrants home, to turn away from the European Union and to abandon free-trade deals. She hopes to solve unemployment by blocking immigration and taxing companies who hire foreigners.
Macron wants to increase European Union cooperation and says France cannot escape the globalised world. He wants to loosen strict labour regulations and reform the eurozone with a common budget.
Three Australian swimmers are facing two-year bans from all competitions for missing three drugs tests over a period of 12 months.
“Swimming Australia confirms it has recently been informed by Asada and Fina that members of the Australian Dolphins Swim team may have failed to update their whereabouts appropriately over the previous 12-month period,” the Australian team said in a statement on Sunday.
All athletes in registered drug testing pools of international federations and national anti-doping organisations are required to provide their whereabouts for one hour every day (between 5am-11pm) when they will be available for testing. Asada said that at the point of each missed test, athletes have the opportunity to put forward an explanation before a missed test declaration was made.
Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson said he would be disappointed if protocols weren’t followed by the swimmers. “Both Swimming Australia and our athletes have been very clear on our position in relation to anti-doping both here in Australia and internationally,” Anderson said in a statement. 
“The Australian Dolphins Swim Team has worked hard to develop a culture of professionalism and respect. Part of that professionalism is ensuring each athlete is accountable and responsible for accurately providing their locations so testers can access them when required. It is extremely disappointing if this has not occurred as it should.”
Ministers have, for the past decade, resolutely refused to acknowledge their obligations in dealing with a problem that is believed to be shortening the lives of thousands of people in the UK. Their change of mind, enforced by Thornton and his team of young lawyers, was a major, humiliating climbdown for our leaders and a significant victory for ClientEarth.
“We have been told that the EU has warned Poland it must stop cutting down trees in the Białowieża forest or face an appearance before the European court and a substantial fine,” says Thornton. “I don’t know what it is about rightwing governments but they do seem to like chopping down trees all the time. However, in this case, this should stop Poland in its tracks.”
“At the time, environmental organisations had only one or two lawyers, and they were used mainly to defend activists who had been arrested,” he says. The green movement, he realised, needed more legal clout in Europe – a point demonstrated in Brussels where there were thousands of corporate lobbyists but only a handful of people on the side of the green movement.
So Thornton set up Client Earth and has since amassed considerable backing from various trusts as well as support from music stars such as Brian Eno and Coldplay. Today the organisation has offices in Warsaw and Brussels and has also established strong connections with China and several African countries.
They were putting off, for a generation, a law they had helped draft and which would help save lives
“The government had agreed EU regulations to improve air quality but then said it had no intention of acting upon them until 2025,” says Thornton. “Effectively, they were putting off, for a generation, a law they had helped draft and that would help save lives.” So ClientEarth stepped in and got an injunction from the supreme court – which was, Thornton says, only the second injunction it had ever delivered. “It ordered the government to come up with a plan to comply with air quality standards by the end of 2015.
“Well, they did publish a plan in time but it was such a bad one that we had to go back to the high court and complain. The court agreed. The plan was so bad it was illegal, it said, and so the government was ordered to redo it and publish in April 2017.”
Then, last month, on the Friday before it was due to outline its revised air quality plan, the government announced – after the courts had closed – that because a general election was looming it would not now be publishing its proposals until September. Again the parties went back to court. And once again the government’s argument was dismissed.
This is an approach on which we will probably have to become increasingly reliant, adds Thornton. “In the case of air quality legislation, the government was saying, essentially, that it had no intention of complying with the law until it felt like doing so. The Treasury was saying it was too expensive to implement, even though lives were being harmed. It was a remarkable intrusion by the Treasury into public interest. The court decided to overrule that effort, however.”
The crucial point, says Thornton, is that the Treasury was saying we should not act on air pollution until it got so bad that the EU would be forced to intercede and threaten to fine us. Then, eventually, Britain would have acted. However, when Britain leaves the EU, then there will be no European enforcer looking over ministers’ shoulders. The role of organisations like ClientEarth will become ever more important.
“What happens after Brexit becomes an open question,” says Thornton. “I am worried that the government may introduce a lot of environmental, health and consumer laws – to replace EU legislation – in a way that renders them ineffective. For instance, they might do it in a way that would give ministers far greater powers to change pollution limits.
We are going to have to oblige the government to do things, not ask them
“If you have a government that does not want to comply with a law, who is going to make them comply if there is no EU? In the UK, it is going to be us.
“Some other organisations do litigation but not in the systematic way that ClientEarth does. A lot of environmental organisations are going to have to become tougher in their tactics in the next few years. We are going to have to oblige the government to do things, not ask them.”
Had he not been a lawyer, Thornton says he would have been a biologist. (he is an avid birdwatcher). “However, I decided not to study what I love and then watch it disappear but to become a lawyer to fight to save it.”
This work is now taking Thornton across the globe. ClientEarth has started work, supported by the Department for International Development, to help indigenous people living in threatened forest lands in Ghana, Gabon, the Ivory Coast, Liberia and the Republic of Congo. It is also helping China with the introduction and implementation of new environmental laws, which – among many things –will allow NGOs to sue firms that pollute. “The Chinese really want to do the right thing,” he says. “It is such a contrast to the UK, which is trying to close down the courts to stop citizens and NGOs bringing cases over issues such as air pollution. In China they are flinging open the doors. But not here. It is very depressing. There has been a real backlash against protecting the environment.”
There may well be a swing back by ministers to a more favourable view of environmental issues, of course, but in the meantime it is clear that far greater individual vigilance over green concerns will have to be practised by environment groups and citizens. The example set by ClientEarth over the past year suggests that a great deal of hard graft lies ahead. “We are facing some very challenging times over issues such as air quality, marine protection and loss of biodiversity,” says Thornton. “We should take nothing that the government does for granted.”
Cleaning up all that was straightforward: turn the machine down to 30C and use an eco detergent.
In terms of plastic fibre volume, a city the size of Berlin may be responsible for releasing the equivalent of 540,000 plastic bags’ worth of them into the ocean daily.
That sounds overwhelming, but the more natural fibres you wear (such as cotton), the better. Frequently washed items should be non-synthetic where possible.
With the rise of the clean beauty movement it can be difficult navigating the plethora of products out there that claim to be natural and organic.
Green People, celebrating 20 years in the business, is the real deal. This is the brand that defined what it means to be organic.
Back in 1999, founder Charlotte Vøhtz, was invited to be on a committee for the Soil Association (the UK body with the most stringent organic certification) to design the first standards for organic beauty.
Vøhtz’s drive to create her truly organic skincare range began when her young daughter Sandra was battling multiple skin allergies and eczema. Now her brand offers 160 sustainable skin and hair products (including two special anniversary ranges), but nothing that has been diluted or bulked out with high levels of water, drying alcohol or synthetic fillers.
He much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches
At 67, still a man mountain at 6ft 4in, face leathery as a saddle-bag and with his latest hairpiece perfectly in place, it seemed he much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches from toffs in bowler hats and pub brawls to cars leaping across Tower Bridge.
Colourfully and unrestrainedly, it was “fucking” and “goddamn” this, or “shit” and “asshole” that as Wayne, one of Hollywood’s most vocal right-wingers, laid into everything and everyone from “whining radicals who call themselves liberals” and “theatre actors who couldn’t polish a bit player’s shoes” to “bank presidents and stock manipulators running studios who know nothing about motion pictures”.
To make that day even more memorable, his often gleefully intemperate tirades were constantly punctuated by painful throat-clearing and phlegmy hawking which, within minutes, had swiftly evolved into an ear-splitting series of wracking coughs and sonorous spitting (into a hanky).
Yet, as Wayne – who had bravely gone public with his lung cancer, coining the term “The Big C”, just a decade earlier – battled his turbulent throat on this warm day in summer, he never showed any obvious signs of weakening or remotely giving in as I offered the occasional, feeble, “It must be very unpleasant” or “Would you like me to leave?”
Someone once wrote: “Film stars don’t die in Liverpool.” Well, they certainly aren’t meant to peg out in Perivale, west London, either.
In fact, the wheezier he became, the more he seemed to warm to his harangues, which also included “today’s filmmakers who’d let all illusion go out the window”.
When, I asked, would he finally call it a day? “I’m gonna finish,” he declared in that famous drawl, “when they say: ‘Oh, do we have to look at that old sonofabitch again?’”
He died in 1979 after completing just two more pictures.

What is it about Italian coaches? Certainly, Serie A offers them the comprehensive grounding. Paul Pogba, the Manchester United midfielder, who spent four seasons at Juventus, described Italy’s top division as “the university of football, especially at a tactical level”. Then, there is Coverciano, the Italian Football Federation’s acclaimed technical centre and finishing school for managers.
“There is a good school in Italy but, honestly, when you arrive in England and you face this league, you must change your mind on a lot of things,” Conte says. “You must adapt very well and very quickly to this league. It is very difficult, very strong and it’s totally different to the Italian or Spanish leagues.
“In every single game, you must fight a lot. You must put all of yourself into every game and if you think you’re playing a team at a medium level you’re actually preparing for a defeat. For this reason it’s not easy [for an English team] to reach the end of a European competition. Also, for the national team, it’s very difficult to do very well in the World Cup or the Euros because you arrive at the end of the season and the players are tired.”
That is for the summer. For now, Conte is consumed by Middlesbrough and the final title push. It stands to lead him into elite company. “For sure, I looked at the past in England and I saw many Italian managers had won the title,” he says. “It’s great for our school and it’s logical to be proud, no? Last season, I supported Claudio Ranieri a lot to win the title and in Italy we celebrated this win in a great way.”
Look at a map of the country and you can see how our old cities were built around rivers, back when people used them daily as a source of water or trade, or for sewage. Today, we rely on them less – but they still play a vital part in British life, and hide some fascinating stories. Here are just a few of the most interesting things about them.
In 1909, the Gloucester and Sharpness canal was in danger. The nearby river Severn was widening day by day and threatened to spill over into the neighbouring waterway. Something had to be done urgently, so the canal company had the idea of killing two birds with one stone. They would shore up the riverbank and decommission some old boats at the same time, by beaching them where the land was thinnest.
 In so doing, they created a unique mausoleum of British nautical history. Barges, schooners and trows – cargo boats with masts that could be taken down to go under bridges – continued to be added until the 1970s, including the Catherine Ellen, a two-masted schooner that had been involved in the Irish War of Independence, and the two barges that caused the 1960 Severn Railway Bridge disaster, when five men lost their lives.
The Avon comes from the Celtic “abona”, via the Welsh “afon”, which just means “river”. As a result, there are eight Avons in England and Scotland, and even an afon Afan in Wales. In the same way, both the Wye and the Wey, a tributary of the Thames, seem to derive from Celtic “weg”, meaning “flowing water”. Thankfully our forebears found time for a double bluff now and then. It makes sense that Cambridge should be the name of the city that straddles the river Cam, but in fact it worked the other way round. Originally called the Granta, on which the city of Grantebrycge was founded, the river changed its name after the city did.
The stretch of the Thames between Kingston and Oxford is one of the most famous sections of river anywhere in the world. This is not because many celebrities have mansions there, although many do – including George and Amal Clooney – but because this was the section travelled by Jerome K Jerome and his friends George Wingrave and Cart Hentschel in a series of short holidays, which became the basis for one of the world’s most uneven yet greatest comic novels, Three Men in a Boat (1889). Though the book may seem like a self-deprecating love letter from the English to themselves, it sold more than a million (mostly bootleg) copies in the US, was a huge hit in Germany and Russia, and has been translated into virtually every language that exists in print. Retracing the route in the story is a popular pilgrimage with fans, not least because the towns and even many of the pubs that Jerome writes about are still there.
Or a percentage of your home at any rate, through one of the country’s 200 or so hydroelectric power stations. To fill you in, hydroelectricity was one of the first forms of renewable power to be generated in Britain, or indeed anywhere. In fact its roots are ancient, since these plants are essentially just grand water wheels, which make water turn a turbine as it flows downhill. This is usually done by damming a river and controlling the flow. Britain’s hydroelectric plants, most of them in Wales and Scotland, supply 1-2% of the country’s electricity, though there is scope to build more. They are especially useful because they can be turned on and off fairly easily according to demand, unlike wind and solar.
The Canal & River Trust cares for 2,000 miles of waterways across England and Wales. It’s a fascinating network full of life, that’s free and open to all, and where there’s something for everyone – whether you are walking your dog, having a family day out or simply want a moment to yourself.
Do they kiss their mommas with those mouths? When interviewed, marchers said that Trump was an “embarrassment” and “unwelcome”. In the end, Trump completed his official engagement and veered back to his New Jersey golf course without even popping in to Trump Tower to see if he could find which cupboard Melania had frantically hidden in this time.
What’s the betting that Trump was sitting in the back of his car pulling his maddest, crossest presidential face – you know, the one that makes him resemble Mount Rushmore before the stonemasons started work?
Only recently, Trump was hinting that being the leader of the free world wasn’t all it was cracked up to be and now this happens.
The people of New York need to take a long hard look at themselves. Anyone would think that the only way that they’d want Trump to take another bite of the Big Apple would be if he instantly choked on it and they got to watch.
The go-ahead for the nation state bill by the ministerial committee for legislation means it will now move forward to a vote by the country’s parliament. The bill has to pass several stages in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for it to become law and could also be challenged in the courts.
Critics say the law is discriminatory and could undermine Israel’s balance of being both a Jewish and democratic state by harming the rights of minorities.
Hebrew and Arabic are both Israel’s national languages, but the bill states that Hebrew would be the lone national language, downgrading Arabic to “a special status in the state” whose “speakers have the right to language-accessible state services”.
The legislation is designed to be enshrined in Israel’s basic law, regarded as the closest approximation in Israel to a constitution.
The timing of the bill – after four years of deliberations – is significant, coming two weeks before a planned visit by Donald Trump in which the US president had hoped to breath life into a moribund peace process.
Although the bill has undergone some changes in the drafting process – not least removing language that would have seen Israel’s democracy subordinated in importance to its Jewish identity – it remains highly contentious.
While the way Israel’s legislative process functions has long allowed parties and individuals to put forward legislation likely to be challenged by the courts, the latest proposed law comes in the context of Israel’s most rightwing ever government.
The committee approved the bill unanimously but the measure has been condemned by opposition politicians, academics and in some parts of the Israeli media.
Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, representing Arab-Israeli parties, said the bill was a “declaration of war” on Israel’s Arab citizens. “Discrimination has received a legal stamp. The danger in this law in that it establishes two classes of citizen – Jewish and Arab,” he said.
Erel Margalit, a contender for the leadership of the centrist Zionist Union party, called the bill “reminiscent of dark periods” in history.
Zehava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, said the bill’s intention was to downgrade the rights of non-Jews in Israel. “The result of the Jewish state bill is clear. Jews will get preference over all other citizens, clearly violating human rights, democracy and the rights of the Arab minority in Israel,” she said.
The bill’s sponsor, Avi Dichter, an MP from Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, defended the proposals, as did other ministers.
 ”This is a small step for the Jewish state bill, which establishes that Israel is and will be a Jewish and democratic state, and it’s a big step towards defining our identity, not only in the eyes of the world but primarily for ourselves, Israelis – to be a free people in our land,” said Dichter after the committee’s vote.
He said the bill was necessary because “events of recent months prove that this is a battle for Israel’s image and national identity. The Palestinians no longer hide their goal of erasing the Jewish people’s nation state”.
The legislative committee’s chairman, Yariv Levin, also a Likud MP, said he had decided to put an end to foot-dragging over the bill. “We’ve been waiting to discuss and make a decision on this legislation for too long. This is a basic law, which has the simple objective of safeguarding Israel’s status as the nation state of the Jewish people. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been made into law so far,” he said.
But the joke soon became serious. Choco started producing and uploading her songs in 2013, but with new album, Sátira (Satire), released in March, as well as a forthcoming European tour, it’s now a full-time job. The album’s title alludes to the randy figure of Greek mythology, while its cover depicts Choco in a wedding dress with chocolate smeared over her throat. “The idea is to present something that generates confusion,” she says, mimicking a shocked face. “Are you a lesbian? Oh my God, is that chocolate?” Sátira comprises seven tracks – most of which have a heavy dose of reggaeton’s signature tinny percussion and synth-led melodies, over which Choco raps in torrents of staccato and sometimes squeaky Spanish.
There was, however, a backlash from women who said her explicit videos and songs, just like those of male artists, were objectifying women. “It was a sensitive subject at the time. If you saw a women in mini-shorts people were like ‘Argh! That’s machismo,’” explains Choco. “I said, it’s great we are analysing this stuff, but what we are doing is putting more taboo on sex.” She also bumped up against an element of classism – reggaeton is grounded in street culture and is often written off as vulgar. “The idea of progress for middle-class Argentinians is that that you shouldn’t be a bitch, you should be intellectual and go to university,” she says.
Despite sticking two well-placed fingers up at the reggaeton establishment, Chocolate remains a “huge fan” of the genre’s megastars such as Daddy Yankee. “He’s not the bad guy,” she says, “he is just responding to the macho culture.” Would she be his support act? “Of course! But right now I don’t think my music is interesting to his audience. I’m presenting an alternative but I’m also saying ‘fuck you’.” She imagines the concert: “I’m there shouting, ‘Your dick is not important’ … Maybe with some years of talking and with some help from psychologists, they could accept it.”
“The prime minister warmly congratulates president-elect Macron on his election success,” the statement said. “France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities.”
While Marine Le Pen was projected to take about 11m votes, double her father’s score in 2002, it was clearly satisfying to many leaders that the far right appeared unable to get above the 40% mark, which some feared would be breached.
“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité! France chose that today. The great nation was, is, and remains in the middle and at the heart of Europe,” wrote Gabriel on Twitter, using France’s national slogan.
Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!
Chinese President Xi Jinping also congratulated the victor, saying China and France shared a “responsibility toward peace and development in the world.”
“China stands ready to work with France to move the strategic Sino-French partnership to a higher level,” he said according to Xinhua news agency.
“It may be too early to conclude that today’s peak of popularism in world politics is beginning to wane,” the nationalist newspaper said.
“Years later when we look back upon this election, we may find that France made a wise choice for human civilisation in helping to keep it moving forward at such a crucial time, rather than setting it back,” it said.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau telephoned Emmanuel Macron to congratulate him.
“I look forward to working closely with President-elect Macron in the years ahead as we work together on a progressive agenda to promote international security, increase collaboration in science and technology, and create good, middle class jobs on both sides of the Atlantic,” he said in a statement earlier.
Highlighting the cooperation between French and Australian soldiers during World War I, he added: “We have been side-by-side in freedom’s cause for over a century, and we are side-by-side in freedom’s cause in the Middle East today. So we have great work to do to make the ties between France and Australia stronger still.”
Not only did the result come as a significant relief for the European commission, but it will be seen by some in Brussels as a vindication of the EU executive’s unprecedented backing for a candidate in a domestic election. The decision to not comment during the Brexit referendum in the UK, and the question of whether that had been the right way forward, had weighed heavily on officials’ minds in Brussels.
Responding to Sunday’s result, Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party, the largest group in the European parliament, of which Merkel and Juncker are members, expressed the relief felt by many at the result and its wider ramifications. “The election shows that people are ready to fight against extremism and populism,” he said. “For all those who think that France can only be strong in a strong Europe and that Europe needs France to be self-confident and sure of its assets, this result is an immense relief.”
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, and now the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “Congratulations to President @EmmanuelMacron! Everyone is looking to #France now to take the lead in a New Deal for Europe.”
Macron is said to be planning to promote democratic conventions in every member state in order to gauge the type of EU citizens are seeking.
He also made public his desire for the 73 seats currently held by UK MEPs to be transferred to a trans-national European list in a symbolic show of support for further pan-European cooperation.
Indeed while Downing Street welcomed the result, the British government may reasonably harbour some concerns about what the result will mean for the Brexit negotiations.
Jonny Bairstow has done all he can to nudge England towards a rethink of their plans before this summer’s Champions Trophy with his brutal exhibition of hitting and the golden arm of Joe Root setting up an 85-run win over Ireland at Lord’s.
Asked to bat under initial grey skies, England hustled their way to 328 for six with Root and Morgan striking 73 and 76 respectively in a stand of 140 before Bairstow turned on the afterburners at the back end of the innings with an unbeaten 72 from 44 balls.
Facing a target one greater than their famous chase of 328 against the same opposition in Bangalore six years ago, Ireland were bowled out for 243 in 46.1 overs as Root’s off-breaks returned three for 52 and Liam Plunkett took three for 23. Nevertheless, individuals stood up for the supportersin green, with 82 from the captain, William Porterfield, following a brawny 48 by the Middlesex opener Paul Stirling.
Stirling’s initial salvo, one of eight crunched fours and a mighty six over the ridiculously short boundary, was, truth be told, the only time England looked as if they might end up grateful for the late flourish to their own innings, where 61 runs were reaped from the final four overs as Bairstow put on something of a show for the 23,000-strong crowd.
The Yorkshireman is due to be a drinks-carrier when Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler return from the Indian Premier League to face South Africa this month before the summer’s main event. But as he mowed Ireland’s bowlers to all parts his inability to command a regular place seemed all the more baffling. At the very least the position of first reserve ahead of Sam Billings – who was given the gloves ahead of him in Buttler’s absence – has surely been locked down.
Putting on 88 in 7.4 overs with his county team-mate Adil Rashid, who wristily flicked a 25-ball 39 from No7 himself, Bairstow delivered his full repertoire, standing tall with his high backlift and manipulating boundaries through power and placement.
Bar one heart-in-the-mouth moment, when George Dockrell held him on the midwicket rope on 43 only to tumble over and throw the ball back into play, he positively glowed in the form that brought him 1,470 Test runs last year, cracking seven fours as well as three sixes.
After heads understandably dropped in the field on Friday, Ireland’s performance in the field was much sharper. Tim Murtagh got the new ball to nibble first up on his home ground, castling Alex Hales on 32 with one that seamed up the slope, while his fellow right-armer Barry McCarthy – until some late tap from Bairstow – was the pick with two for 61.
Porterfield rotated his attack throughout, making 23 bowling changes in a bid to prevent the home side settling. Settle they did, however, after Hales and Jason Roy fell in the space of three overs – the latter picking out extra cover to make it 60 for two in the 13th – with Morgan and Root then easing to half-centuries at around a run a ball when an England team of old might have consolidated.
Morgan, whose one wobble before eventually chipping McCarthy to extra cover came on 39 when a ball from Stirling’s off-spin trickled on to the stumps without disturbing them, carved the bowlers in typical fashion thereafter, while Root glossily stroked his way to a fifth 50-plus score in seven innings this year before picking out mid-off.
England struggled early in the reply – not least David Willey, who saw his three overs with the new ball crashed for 23 runs and did not return – but after Jake Ball removed Stirling in the 14th over, thanks to a faint snick behind picked up on review, the second innings belonged to Root, who bowled the full allocation for the first time in his one-day career.
Castling Ed Joyce with a sliding round-arm delivery for 16, and then getting Niall O’Brien and Gary Wilson held in the deep, Root’s form with the ball may be the best way for his fellow Yorkshireman, Bairstow, to be retained in a move that would mean England leaving Moeen Ali out as they have during this mini-series.
With Chris Woakes similarly coming back from the IPL, Plunkett made sure he will not be one to make way following a strong tour of the Caribbean in March by trapping Andy Balbirnie lbw with an 89mph delivery and persuading both Murtagh and McCarthy to pick out Ball on the rope in his second spell.
Rashid followed his five-wicket showing in Bristol by ending Kevin O’Brien’s brief repeat of his Bangalore six-hitting on 18. Mark Wood, who along with Willey endured some early butchery from Stirling, snuffed out Portferfield’s vigil when he was bowled trying a flick down leg, before completing the win by crashing a yorker into Dockrell’s stumps.
 Last month, a Pentagon spokesman said Hasib had probably been killed during the raid on 27 April by US and Afghan special forces in Nangarhar during which two US army Rangers were killed. But prior to Sunday’s announcement there had been no confirmation.
 The statement, following an earlier announcement by Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, said Hasib directed the 8 March attack on the main Kabul military hospital by a group of militants disguised as doctors. Dozens of medical staff and patients were killed in the attack.
 It said he also ordered fighters to behead local elders in front of their families and kidnap women and girls to force them to marry Isis fighters.
 The local affiliate of Islamic State, sometimes known as Islamic State Khorasan (Isis-K), after an old name for the region that includes Afghanistan, has been active since 2015, fighting both the Taliban as well as Afghan and US forces.
 It is believed to maintain links with the main Islamic State movement in Iraq and Syria but has considerable operational independence.
 US and Afghan special forces, backed by drone strikes and other air support, have waged a series of operations against Isis-K since March, killing dozens of their fighters, mainly in Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan.
 The US military statement said that in addition to claiming the life of Hasib, 35 Islamic State fighters and several high ranking commanders were also killed in the 27 April raid.
 Hundreds of fighters had been killed or captured this year and the offensive was continuing, with over half the districts controlled by Isis-K retaken, allowing residents in some places to return for the first time in two years.
But Berisha’s brilliance – and James Troisi’s extra-time volley that struck a post – could not prevent Sydney’s third A-League title, secured in a mostly jubilant, but uniformly breathless, arena that had witnessed fireworks – both metaphorical and literal – from start to finish. It also went some way to eliminate painful memories of the last time these two sides met in a grand final, two years ago in Melbourne, although Graham Arnold would rather have won in different circumstances.
“I’ve been through that [a grand final penalty shootout] before,” the Sydney coach said. “It’s not the greatest way to win or lose. But that’s the way it is. I thought it was a real cup final. It was a very physical game, a lot of free-kicks, a lot of fouls, a lot of passion.”
Indeed, it was far from a classic encounter between these two old rivals but what it lacked in class and guile was made up for in brawn and, by the end of the night, pure drama. From the first whistle, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque set the tone, leaving a high foot in on eventual Joe Marston medal recipient Daniel Georgievski’s thigh and what ensued during a niggly, and at times spiteful, game should have come as no surprise.
Referee Jarred Gillett had his work cut out – nearly every decision he made was vociferously contested by one side or the other, and the opening period ended with five names in his notebook. He had accrued a total of 11 by the time the shootout arrived. Meanwhile, Graham Arnold and Kevin Muscat spent much of their time stalking the touchline and berating the fourth official.
The flow of the game suffered from the regular stoppages, playacting and constant recriminations – and arguably the state of the pitch, which had been used for a Super Rugby fixture the previous night despite a last-ditch attempt to shift that fixture elsewhere. With both team’s more creative players stifled, the likes of Ninković and Rojas were unable to stamp their authority in the way they might have been expected.
With supply lines cut, scoring opportunities were few and far between. Fahid Ben Khalfallah found Rojas at the back post with pinpoint accuracy after 11 minutes, but the New Zealand international’s pull back across the face of goal was turned over the bar by a Sydney defender.
Ninković was able, fleetingly, to give a glimpse of what he is capable of when he delivered a teasing ball across the face of goal on 16 minutes, the kind that must have been in mind when the term “corridor of uncertainty” was invented. Victory survived, but it led to a brief period when Sydney began to flex their muscles for the first time.
Berisha soon put paid to that with his individual moment of brilliance. The Kosovo international took on the Sydney defence with the kind of single-minded intent that has become his trademark. The way he scythed through Sydney’s backline showed scant regard for a defence that had, to that point, conceded just 12 goals all season. He has now scored in each of the four grand finals he has appeared in.
The initial spate of bookings came soon after the deadlock had been broken and it took just over 20 minutes for Khalfallah and James Troisi to been shown yellow, along with Sydney’s Josh Brillante, Ninković and Filip Hološko. Three of those names were taken following an ugly 20-man coming together in the centre circle as tempers boiled over in a moment that typified the first half.
Any hopes that cooler heads would emerge after the break soon evaporated as Victory skipper Carl Valeri levelled the booking ledger by becoming Victory’s third man into the book, for a crude challenge that might have warranted a straight red on another day.
Football was, however, occasionally allowed to shine through amid the pervading fug. Most of it came from Sydney in the second half and it was the home side who fashioned the better chances – first Hološko ballooned over from close range when he should really have done better, and then David Carney, on for Hološko, saw an effort saved by Thomas.
Carney, who won the title 11 years ago during his first stint with Sydney, was to play a key role moments later. It was his curling shot that Lawrence Thomas tipped onto the inside of the post, leaving a desperate, prone Berisha to head feebly into the path of the onrushing Grant. The right-back tapped gleefully home.
The goal further invigorated Sydney, yet try as they might and amid much huffing and puffing they were unable to blow down Victory’s door again in regulation time. Indeed, they could have been caught on the break, as Rojas and Troisi combined well, but the latter lacked a finishing touch.
“The first half was difficult,” Arnold said. “The first half we didn’t play our way, we ended up playing a game of kick and rush and fighting for the second ball. And when you have the quality of players like Ninković and Brosque that’s not their type of game.
“I said at half-time I’d rather lose than not play our way, the way we’ve played all season, the way we’ve created history with a lot of things. I wanted us to play our way and we did.”
To extra-time and Victory pulses again quickened, momentarily, when a high ball was launched into the box before it skewed away from a posse of players and brushed the outside of the post; the flag was up, regardless.
After the changeover, and with tired limbs in evidence all over the pitch, Troisi dug deep and mustered what so nearly could have been the defining moment of the game – a truly brilliant volley that arguably deserved to be the winner, but he saw it cannon back off Vukovic’s upright.
At the other end, Carney had a chance to settle it with five minutes remaining but he sliced his shot horribly to leave the expectant home crowd frustrated – and preparing to accept that their entire season, which had been so dominant, would not only come down to a winner-takes-all match, but rather one decisive penalty shootout. This time for Sydney, they will feel justice was served.
Mrs May is not the most awesome political genius to walk the earth. Far from it. She has little in the way of solid achievement to show for her nine months at Number 10 and has spent her election campaign swaddled in opacity about what she would do with a five-year term. Mrs May only gets to look unbeatable because of the paucity of the competition provided by a Labour leadership that combines unelectable hard leftism with utter ineptness.
It was not “inevitable” that we would have this “Brexit election” at all. This is happening because of the narrow victory for Out in the referendum last year. Only a small amount of mental energy is required to envisage an alternative history that would have produced a different result. A Labour party under more credible leadership that had demonstrated some enthusiasm for the Remain cause could very well have tipped the result the other way when the country made its choice about Europe.
As Labour stares into the jaws of disaster, it is essential to grasp that there was nothing pre-ordained about this rout. The electoral evisceration of Labour wasn’t written in the stars. Defeat is not to be blamed on the whims of the gods or the tides of the moon. This calamity can’t be put down to the caprice of fate. The Tories were handed this opportunity to smash their way to a big majority because Labour made terrible choices and is under abysmal leadership.
A thumping Tory triumph now looks unstoppable. It was never inevitable.
There was no last-gasp escape for the dishevelled Lancashire club, just as there is no miracle cure for the ills that have afflicted Rovers since they were taken over by an Indian chicken-processing corporation in 2010. Blackburn were 14th in the top flight back then; now they are heading towards the third tier, a level unknown to them since their return in 1980.
The fall would be easier for the club’s fans to tolerate if they had confidence that the team have reached rock bottom. But Rovers are around £100m in debt, many of the players are due to leave this summer and the owner has given no indication that it has the will or ability to stop the slide, let alone reverse it.
Two telephone calls remain the only contact that Tony Mowbray has had with Venky’s since being appointed Blackburn manager in February. He says he is scheduled to fly to India “in the next week or two” to find out how seriously the owner intends backing a promotion attempt. Given that the club have spent £250,000 on players in the past two years, optimism at this point would seem misplaced. The table says that goal difference did for Blackburn in the end, but the main cause was ineptitude away from the pitch, along with neglect or worse.
It was fitting, in a way, that Blackburn’s relegation came after an ultimately useless victory, a denouement highlighting the potential that has been wasted at the club. The spirit shown by players on the pitch and supporters in the stands was overridden by events beyond their control.
Rovers fans rode a whirl of emotions, lurching from optimism to joy, then to fear and, finally, sorrow and rage. “We want our Rovers back,” the 1,650 demanded after the final whistle here. Who knows when, or whether, they will get their wish?
It had all started like a dream for Mowbray’s team. Charlie Mulgrew shot them into the lead in the 10th minute with an immaculate free-kick, curling the ball into the top corner from 25 yards. Rovers fans began singing and dancing because as things stood, their side were on course to survive. That prospect grew brighter when Blackburn scored again six minutes later, Danny Guthrie grabbing his first goal for the club thanks to a excellent work by Sam Gallagher, a deflection off a defender and weak goalkeeping by Daniel Bentley, who allowed the ball to trickle over the line. With so many things going in Rovers’ favour, it was no wonder there was suddenly conviction in the away fans’ chants of “We are staying up”.
But then Forest scored against Ipswich Town, and Brentford fans gleefully relayed the news with chants of “You are going down”. The travelling contingent retorted with cries of “We’re going to win 3-0”. Not the most sophisticated tit‑for‑tat, admittedly, but the soundtrack gave the atmosphere an extra fizz and tension.
And Rovers did create chances to make it 3-0. Gallagher, on loan from Southampton, was so committed to Blackburn’s cause that he collided with a goalpost as he tried to divert a cross from Elliott Bennett into the net, but his bravery was unrewarded as his shot flew over the bar. Derrick Williams also fired over from close range before Gallagher got another opportunity just before half-time, only to be denied by David Raya.
Brentford had been loose in the first half but improved in the second. So, elsewhere, did Forest. Blackburn’s hopes deteriorated further when Lasse Vibe pulled a goal back for Brentford, superbly flicking Harlee Dean’s low cross beyond the reach of David Raya in the Blackburn goal. Blackburn fans were struck dumb. Mowbray clasped his head in his hands.
Brentford continued to attack, intent on ending their own season on a high in front of a home crowd. Blackburn did not surrender even as their chances of survival grew more remote. Craig Conway rocketed a penalty into the net after being fouled by Dean, whose season ended a little earlier than everyone else’s when the referee showed him a red card.
Elsewhere, Birmingham’s match ended earlier than expected, too, as the referee blew for full-time prematurely, at least if the fourth official had been correct when indicating the amount of time that would be added on.
That was just another irritating quirk on a sorry day for Rovers, to be filed alongside the fact that Newcastle United were confirmed as champions: Rovers did the double over them this season.
So Blackburn ended with a two-goal win that took Mowbray’s haul since replacing the sacked Owen Coyle to 22 points from 15 matches. If they had gained points at that rate all season they would have finished in the top half. But Rovers got their act together too late. Their next performance will be in League One.
International support for landmine clearance has fallen below $400m for the first time in a decade
The effects of war are felt in the devastation of services; the destruction of economies; the fragmentation of families and communities; long-term injuries and illnesses; and, of course, the absence of loved ones. But you cannot restore water supplies or reopen schools or plant crops if you cannot cross the land safely. You cannot recover psychologically while living in constant fear of setting foot in the wrong place. The converse of that depressing truth is that investing in munitions destruction and clearance pays dividends. It is the first step to solving many more problems.
William talks of his “pain” and “shock”, plus “the humiliation heaped on his wife”. What he doesn’t explain, though, is why it’s necessary to revive all that pain and angst half a decade later – especially since, quite clinically, no French court is going to award him more than a (perhaps humiliating) fraction of the damages he seeks.
A future monarch needs a better legal advice team. Or maybe just have a word with the Duke of Edinburgh before he goes.
Some of it is art. But fundamentally, I entertain
Mulling this over, I get the nod that Scott is ready for me. Walking into the suite, I find him rearranging the furniture. “I can’t have those soft chairs,” he explains, his accent a bit Stockton, a bit Hollywood. “They’re no good for my back.” If, as Alan Parker suggests, you are struggling to place the face, Scott has something of the Bryan Cranston about him. His hair, once rusty red, is gradually turning metallic silver, his moustache holding out longest. He’s 5ft 7in, give or take, and is dressed today in his standard film-set attire: black fleece jacket and sensible shoes.
Why, I wonder aloud, don’t we see more of Scott? He looks perplexed by the inquiry, perhaps understandably, but answers gnomically: “I do enough.”
And, in a way, I’ve got my answer as to why Scott makes his films and then keeps his head down.
The script that Scott read had an all-male crew, but there was a change of heart at 20th Century Fox and two of the characters were switched to women, including Ellen Ripley, the last surviving member of the ship. “I cast Ripley really late,” says Scott. “Two weeks out, we still hadn’t found her. Then somebody came up, I think it was Warren Beatty, and said, ‘There’s this woman, on off-Broadway, on the theatre boards called Sigourney Weaver, you should meet with her. Interesting.’ So I called her, went to New York, she walks in, she must have been 6ft 6in, with an afro, so she’s 7ft 2in. And I was like a midget, and I had dinner with her. That was it!”
Neither Scott nor Weaver, apparently, realised it, but Ripley would become an iconic heroine. “It hadn’t dawned on me,” admits Scott. “After the event, I went, ‘Oh, OK, yeah, absolutely,’ but I never thought about that.”
Being in Berlin seems to have put Scott in a reflective mood and, without much prompting, he starts to talk about his childhood. His father Francis was a colonel in the Royal Engineers and the family spent five years in West Germany after the war as part of the Marshall plan. They lived in a house so grand it had a library and Scott went to boarding school in Wilhelmshaven, where he used to watch U-boats in the North Sea: “I loved it.” Francis was offered the prestigious position of head of port authority for the Elbe, based in Hamburg, but Scott’s mother wanted to return home to be near her relatives. Scott smiles, “I remember saying, at eight-and-a-half: ‘Take the job. You’re making the wrong decision.’ But it wasn’t to be, and we went back to Stockton-on-Tees and ended up on a council estate.
“My dad was a great guy, he did the right thing for the family, but he was not a happy man for the rest of his life,” Scott goes on. “And the interesting thing is that nobody said anything. We just looked at the house, pebble dash, move in and that’s it, dude. You’d get on with it.”
Back in the north-east, Scott went to a secondary modern school. He struggled academically; only later did he think that he might be slightly dyslexic. “After being bottom for five years, I decided that I wasn’t academically sound – for anything, truly. And I was really trying. I wasn’t lazy. I just couldn’t retain anything that I wasn’t interested in. If I’m interested, I’ve got a photographic brain. I could walk out of this room and in a year, I could draw it right down to the paintings on the wall.”
Tony Scott killed himself in 2012, jumping from a suspension bridge in Los Angeles. Ridley later revealed that Tony had cancer. “Being an elder brother, if ever there was an argument about anything, I’d back off, always,” says Scott now. “Nothing’s worth losing a relationship over. So I’d always back down, say, ‘OK, then.’” He laughs affectionately, “He was like the spoiled brat really.
Family is Scott’s one great concern outside of films – his other big passion in life was tennis, which he played very competitively, always singles, well into his 70s, until he blew his knees. He is married to the Costa Rican actor Giannina Facio, his third wife, and they move between houses in Los Angeles, London and the Luberon in Provence. He has three grown-up children – Jake, Luke and Jordan – all of whom have followed him into the business, either in films or advertising. It is little surprise then that Scott has felt the loss of his brother keenly. He often called Tony the one person in Hollywood he could trust – and he still thinks of him every time he finishes a project.
“They are quite different as people, but they are both very smart. You better do your homework. Or you better have your point of view, because if you don’t, they’re going to stomp on you. When they say, ‘Why would I do that?’ you better have a bloody good answer.”
“It all comes full circle to starting out as a painter. You walk in the room in the morning, where you spent all day yesterday by yourself. You stare at the canvas and you go: ‘Bloody hell, I hate it.’ Painting is all about what you did yesterday, how you’re going to recorrect it, improve it, or go: ‘Holy shit, I got it.’” He pauses, perhaps remembering Pauline Kael and her real or imagined slights against his beard. “It’s being your own critic, that’s it. That’s the most important thing.”
Scott is well known for his time-keeping and, today, ours is up. After the current round of press requirements, he will again disappear. Back to his films, until the next time. It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy the attention, he just doesn’t need it. “Thanks,” he says, as I get up to leave, “but you know I won’t read it, don’t you?”
Alien: Covenant is out on 12 May
The artwork emerged overnight on the Castle Amusements building near the ferry terminal, which connects the UK with mainland Europe.
The mural, which was confirmed by Banksy’s representatives to be a genuine work by the elusive artist, is his first comment on the Brexit vote last year.
This was a staggering, historic high for the anti-European, anti-immigration party that during the campaign was slammed by political opponents as racist, xenophobic, antisemitic and anti-Muslim despite Le Pen’s public relations efforts to detoxify its image in recent years.
Political scientists have warned that no one should write off the French far right after Marine Le Pen’s presidential loss. The Front National has slowly been gaining ground for the last 45 years and its steady electoral increases must be seen in the long term. The issues that the party has sought to focus on and capitalise from – the terrorist threat, the refugee crisis, immigration, mass unemployment, deindustrialisation, voters who struggle to make ends meet – are unlikely to instantly disappear.
“The Front National is not finished,” said Jean-Yves Camus, director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean-Jaurès foundation in Paris. “We have no reason to believe that the job market will change for the better in the next few years. We have no reason to believe that the negative impact of globalisation will stop during the years to come. So there might be a drop in the Front National vote, but if the situation is bad in 2022 [at the time of the next presidential election], they could rise again.”
The Front National’s immediate focus now is the French parliamentary election to be held in two rounds on 11 and 18 June. The party only has two MPs in the 577-seat French national assembly and the current voting system – which does not feature proportional representation – makes it hard for the far right to translate millions of presidential votes into constituency seats. The Front National is hoping to win at least 15 MPs, which would be enough to have its own parliamentary grouping, but much depends on how the left, right and Macron’s new centrist En Marche! movement decide to field opposing candidates.
Party strategists must now decide whether this can be translated to seats in parliament. Le Pen has not said if she will run for parliament herself.
The tipping point came when the couple went to trade the two-bedroom townhouse they had bought in Riverwood in 2006 for something more spacious. Even with hundreds of thousands of dollars of equity, they were quickly forced to compromise on quality and location.
I can't believe how difficult it is [in Sydney] to have a simple life and raise your family
Mitry remembers going to view a “suburban shack, a hole in the ground” with nearly 100 other people, lined up down the street: “I couldn’t even find a parking spot.
“There were many moments when I knew this is over, I’m not going to do this any more, but that’s the one that stands out.”
He hung on in Sydney for a further four or five years before accepting that, in order to own a family home, both he and his wife would have to work full-time and all three children would have to attend before- and after-school care.
“I was almost going to commit to not having breakfast with my kids on weekdays. That, to me, was the defining moment: did I want to watch my kids grow up, or did I want to hear about it from carers and my wife?”
Many in Australia’s largest city are finding themselves faced with the same trade-off between free time, disposable income, quality of life – and simply keeping a foot on the property ladder.
In a lose-lose situation, an obvious question arises: why stay?
“Financially, yes, it was an easy decision,” Mitry says. “But money was only a part of the spreadsheet of factors we made.”
He admits to feeling “a little bit homesick” for Sydney but has no doubts that the move was the right one. Their Riverwood townhouse sold for $650,000 and they bought their 750 sq m “forever home” in Canberra for $600,000. The mortgage is “extremely manageable” even after a family holiday to London – something that didn’t seem possible in Sydney.
“Every time I make a joke about how quiet it is down here, you’re reminded very quickly that you would be paying $1.2m for a house that required renovating every year, instead of going on holiday.”
“The kids can walk to school – that just blew my mind, the first time I let them do that. The neighbours brought round cookies. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
But its overpriced property market puts that reputation at risk. A city’s political stability, education and health services, public transport, arts and culture scene, natural beauty – all are incidental if people can’t picture a future there.
Mitry says superficial comparisons between the life he chose in Canberra and the one that was available to him in Sydney distract from the crux of the issue: “the bloody price of the houses”.
He knows couples who have moved in with their parents, children in tow, to save for a deposit. As hard as it was for him to move away from his own parents, he reasoned being better off would allow him to provide for them in future.
“I can’t believe how much Sydney has changed, how difficult it is to have a simple life and raise your family,” he says. “It’s not too much to ask for both parents to be able to work really hard and have a nice, or half-decent, house to show for it.
The kids can walk to school [in Canberra] – that just blew my mind, the first time I let them do that.
“It just seems a little bit ridiculous. People who work really hard, who are supremely qualified and good at their jobs, who are really good with money – they’re still priced out of the market.”
Among Sydney residents, home ownership is often spoken about as though mutually exclusive with a professional career, or even urban living. Shut out of the property market, people joke about moving to Wagga Wagga or Gundagai as though affordable housing would be the only reason someone would ever opt to live in a small rural town.
In such a grossly inflated market, the conventional wisdom for aspiring first-home owners – to start small in desirable suburbs, to scrimp on small pleasures – does not apply.
Mitry is sympathetic towards young people forced to make decisions and trade-offs that, at their age, he was free to put off. “I was thinking about nothing when I was 20, 25 – maybe, what pub are we going to go to on Friday?
“But I was still in a position where I could get my act together for a few years and get a bank to give me a mortgage.”
Given the sacrifices involved, it’s hardly surprising that many 20- and even 30-somethings in Sydney now do not think of home ownership as a priority, or even a possibility.
As a self-described “low-income earner” Georgia Leaker, 28, has never considered owning her own home as an option, in Sydney or elsewhere. In the past five years she has worked primarily as a copywriter, often in short-term roles. Her highest salary has been $45,000.
A month ago she was made redundant. Shortly afterwards, she called time on Sydney. “It’s got to a point where the rising costs around me have made Sydney nearly unliveable for me,” she says.
She considers herself fortunate to have found a central apartment in the inner city suburb of Darlinghurst for well below market rent, and has followed a rigorous budget to afford an overseas holiday every year. “But it’s exhausting – I want a bit more flexibility in my week instead of having to constantly say no to things.”
In a couple of weeks Leaker will move back to her hometown of Melbourne. She figures it will mean an extra $150 in her pocket a week, mostly from reduced rent. She is hopeful more disposable income in a “less cut-throat” city will ease her anxiety.
“Sydney’s been a bit of a shitfight … In the last five years, I’ve had a lot of highs but it’s still been, ‘Let’s kick you down again!’ I’m looking for a break, emotionally and financially.”
Her timeline may have been brought forward but leaving Sydney before her 30th birthday had felt inevitable, she says.
“I was a little bit sick of the rising cost of housing, and the fact that I just didn’t feel I was any further along with my career – like I’m just another one of those people in their 20s who can’t get their shit together.
“Not that there’s anything wrong with that,” she adds. “I think there are more of us than I think, say, my parents would want to admit. They’re starting to realise that it’s not just me, it’s symptomatic of a larger problem.”
It is inaccurate to frame Sydney’s housing affordability crisis as a generational issue when even people already on the property ladder are getting knocked off.
When it came time to leave his two-bedroom apartment in Artarmon to accommodate his young family, Andrew Whitehead was prepared to move further out of the city. But even on the central coast, he and his wife found the houses overpriced – and made less attractive by a 90-minute one-way commute to work.
“It just seemed silly to us to do that, so we decided to get out of Sydney.”
It was more important for us to have somewhere to settle that’s close to work and we can afford to pay off
Moving to a new city had the added appeal of being “a bit outside the box”, too. “Choosing to stay in Sydney but go out to the suburbs felt so much like what my parents did as well, and you could tell they weren’t ever happy,” Whitehead says. “They were just grinding away and paying the mortgage.”
The decision of destination was made for them when Whitehead was offered a job in Wellington with the same salary as in Sydney. In January, he and his wife crossed the Tasman with their children, now aged two and a half and nine months.
As well as retaining the apartment in Artamon as an investment, they rent a house in Tawa, a 17-minute train ride from Whitehead’s workplace. While it’s a significantly smaller city, the quality of life in Wellington is similar to that in Sydney, he says – they just have more time and money with which to enjoy it.
“Sydney has got a good cultural scene … great weather, nice beaches, that kind of thing. But when you’ve got a family, we didn’t go into the city any more. I hadn’t been to the beach in nine months.
“It was more important for us to have somewhere to settle that’s close to work and we can afford to pay off.”
Whitehead admits to being in the “honeymoon period” with his new home, and the past few months have passed quickly thanks to a steady stream of visitors from Australia.
He had not wanted to leave Sydney, he says. But the cost of living there proved more than a matter of money.
“Realistically, it just doesn’t make sense,” he says, sounding defeated. “I can’t justify staying in the city, increasing my mortgage, and then travelling an extra hour every day to do it, and never seeing my family.
“All those things are so silly. We could just go somewhere else and it be relaxed and nice.”
But it wasn’t as obvious a decision as it sounds. With some self-awareness, Whitehead describes a spreadsheet he made, weighing the different factors for each possible destination according to how important to him they were: an attempt at a “really rational decision-making process”, he says.
“Sydney came out on top.”
Within minutes of arriving to collect my professionally bound thesis, I found myself on the receiving end of an unsolicited and impenetrable rant about female genital mutilation.
“What’s your paper on?” the shop owner inquired.
“It’s on Muslim women and … ,” I began, but before I could finish my sentence, he had launched into the subject.
The fact that I hadn’t even mentioned the words “female genital mutilation” was irrelevant; merely saying “Muslim women” was a wide enough rabbit hole for him to dart down. My presence as a Muslim woman and my half-delivered topic were the only encouragement he needed.
It’s uncanny how often people try to demonstrate their concern about the alleged oppression of Muslim women by humiliating them. Even finding out the details of my research findings doesn’t seem to deter them from baldly sharing opinions.
I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about 'Islam’s treatment of women' countless times
When I was neck-deep in my doctoral research, I attended a black-tie journalism-industry dinner on a windy Sydney night. Some of Australia’s most intelligent and perceptive thinkers were in the well-dressed crowd. I had grown accustomed to answering questions about my subject. I had also grown quite used to the standard responses I received to my thesis, and habitually gave ambiguous answers to avoid them.
A well-known and popular journalist approached me and asked what I did for living. His reaction, despite belonging to a group of people usually known for their cognitive skills, was so representative that I scribbled it down on a dinner napkin as soon as he left so I would not forget a word:
Journalist: So what do you do?
Me: I’m completing my PhD.
Journalist: On?
Me: (purposefully vague) Sociology and politics.
Journalist: But what is your exact research question?
Me: (inward sigh at what was inevitably to follow, but valiantly indifferent exterior) I’m investigating the way Muslim women fight sexism within Muslim communities.
Journalist: (with widened, alarmed eyes) That’s dangerous waters!
Me: (through gritted teeth) Not really. It’s been going on for many hundreds of years, and I’ve been spoiled for choice with the number of women who have been willing to be participants in my research.
Journalist: Did they want it known what they were doing? Or did they need it kept secret?
Me: (icy frustration descends into Arctic winter) Oh, many of them were happy to be identified in my research. In fact, some were angry when I suggested giving them a pseudonym, insisting they wanted to be known for this work.
Journalist: (now completely flabbergasted) But … but, did their husbands know of their apostasy?!
Me: (choosing to ignore use of “apostasy” as eyes take on glacial sheen) Actually, many of the women listed their husbands, or another Muslim man – like their father or imam – as their greatest supporters.
Journalist: (now quite literally speechless) …
I’ve had similar exchanges — too many to count — with non-Muslims over the course of my research. Commonplace is the firm conviction that sexism against Muslim women is rife, most often coupled with the utter disbelief that women who challenge sexism could exist, let alone that there are many of them, that they are not a new phenomenon, and that Muslim men often support them in their efforts. I often wonder how people can be so comfortable presenting these attitudes directly to me, a clearly identifiable Muslim woman in a hijab. They do not appear at all uneasy in making it apparent just how bad they think life is for any and all Muslim women, and how unengaged they believe Muslim women to be in confronting the sexism they invariably face.
I have received similar, but different, reactions within some sections of various Muslim communities when they found out the focus of my research. Often I would be purposefully vague when discussing my topic with them, too. I would restrict myself to saying that I was researching “Muslim women”, and avoid highlighting the “fighting sexism” part, as there is a complicated, often suspicious attitude towards anything that may be perceived as “feminism” within Muslim communities. Or I would rush to reassure them that I was not framing this in an anti-religious perspective.
Their scepticism is perhaps an understandable reaction from a minority community that frequently feels under siege, particularly when it comes to women’s rights. I hoped the fact that my research was being carried out from within a common faith, and that it drew explicitly and deeply on the theological resources afforded by this, reassured them that I, unlike many others, was not engaging in an attack on the faith and communities they held dear.
But still certain people within the Muslim community were scornful, rolling their eyes and calling me a feminist — not as a compliment, but a warning. They saw feminism and Islam as inherently at odds.
This is the terrain in which my research into Muslim women occurred. The subject is fraught on multiple fronts; the topic of “Muslim women and sexism” is a minefield of unflappable certainty and indignation from all corners. Yet for something about which so many people are adamantly sure, I feel there is very little information from the women actually involved. It seems to me that, in the argument in which Muslim women are the battlefield, the war rages on and the angry accusations zing past their heads from all sides. The main casualty is, ironically, women’s self-determination.
Islam is arguably the most discussed religion in the west today, in both media and society, and, after terrorism, the plight of Muslim women is probably the most controversial topic of debate. I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about “Islam’s treatment of women” countless times in person and online. Nonetheless, there is only a small amount of published work available on the topic of Muslim women fighting sexism within Muslim communities, and much of that focuses on women who see Islam as inherently part of the problem — if not the whole problem — that Muslim women face.
The assumption is that Muslim women need to be extricated from the religion entirely before anything close to liberation or equality can be achieved.
There are limited sociological accounts of Muslim women who fight sexism from a faith-positive perspective, and only a handful of studies that investigate the theological works of some Muslim feminists. The responses to, and motivations of, these women are dealt with coincidentally, as opposed to primarily. This small pool of available resources clashes with what I know anecdotally to be happening in many Muslim communities, as well as the historical accounts of Muslim women who, from the earliest days of Islam, have been challenging the sexism they have experienced by using religious arguments.
For years now I have been speaking about issues relating to Islam, Muslims and gender to the media, both Australian and overseas. In one sense I choose this, but in another it has been chosen for me, moulded by the way others attempt to define and restrict me, more or less obliging me to respond.
It’s a common story. Jasmin Zine, a Canadian scholar, once observed that not just our actions but also our very identities are constantly being shaped by dual, competing discourses that surround us. There’s the fundamentalist, patriarchal narrative, persistently trying to confine the social and public lives of Muslim women in line with the kind of narrow, gendered parameters that are by now so familiar. But there are also some western feminist discourses that seek to define our identities in ways that are quite neocolonial: backward, oppressed, with no hope of liberation other than to emulate whatever western notions of womanhood are on offer. This wedging chimes with my experience, and it’s a problem because, as Zine argues, both arms deny Muslim women the ability — indeed the right — to define our identities for ourselves, and especially to do so within the vast possibilities of Islam.
It is as though male Muslim scholars and non-Muslim western feminists have handed down predetermined scripts for us to live by. And it is left to those people thought not to exist — Muslim women who fight sexism — to rewrite those scenarios and reclaim our identities.
“The accident happened when the bus was descending on a steep hill in rainy conditions,” regional commander Charles Mkumbo said. “We are still investigating the incident to determine if it was caused by a mechanical defect or human error on the part of the driver.”
The pupils killed in the accident, which occurred at about 9.30am in Karatu district, were aged 12 to 13, and from the Lucky Vincent primary school on their way to visit another school, Mkumbo said.
Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, described the accident as a national tragedy in a statement.
While no one is immune, pollution particularly affects children, whose lungs are still developing. Key culprits are diesel vehicles, followed by gas combustion from boilers and cookers.
Air pollution shares none of the intractable characteristics of problems such as climate change and microbial resistance. Unlike the latter, air pollution, on the whole, respects international borders and does not require the international treaties and agreements that can take years to hammer out.
Cleaning up our air is eminently achievable with the right package of measures. We need a mix of clean air zones that include charging owners of diesel vehicles to drive into densely populated urban areas, a scrappage scheme for diesel cars, a tax system that discourages owners from buying diesel and much tougher European testing.
The government is clearly concerned about proposing any measures that would hit diesel drivers a few weeks before the general election. Yet Thursday’s local election results show it has nothing to fear: barring an electoral earthquake, it is on course for a decisive victory. Votes before lives: that’s Theresa May’s telling choice.
Indonesian authorities have said about 200 inmates remain at large two days after a mass escape from an overcrowded prison on Sumatra island.
The breakout at Sialang Bungkuk prison in Pekanbaru on Friday occurred when prisoners were let out of their cells to perform prayers. They broke through a prison door, overwhelming the few guards on duty.
Police said 242 men had been recaptured by Sunday morning, leaving about 200 still at large.
Authorities were initially uncertain how many prisoners had escaped, estimating the numbers at between 100 and 300.
Police said some of the men surrendered or were returned by their families and others were captured by local residents, police and soldiers.
Various officials have said the prisoners were angry about poor conditions and treatment. The prison has a capacity of about 360 but was holding more than 1,870 men, according to a local police spokesman, Guntur Aryo Tejo.
Tejo said four of the escaped inmates were apprehended by police late on Friday about 60 miles from the prison, on a bus heading for West Sumatra province.
Hundreds of police and soldiers have been deployed in the hunt for the prisoners.
Friday’s escape was the biggest since July 2013 when about 240 prisoners, including several convicted terrorists, escaped after a deadly riot at a prison in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province.
Bzzz. Bzzz. I can still remember the sound and the feeling of having my head shaved for the first time. It was a warm evening in July, I had some kind of throat infection and we were about to go on holiday. I had been dyeing my hair various colours of the rainbow since I was 12. The only options I had left were green or … shaved. I was about to start a new job and felt, for a few reasons, that I was starting again. Shaved it would be. As my hair dropped to the floor, and we went shorter and shorter with the clippers, I felt lighter, liberated, ecstatic. It sounds ridiculous, but the effect was so powerful that my tonsils, or whatever it was, stopped hurting.
I had recently stopped drinking and I wanted to cut off the past and its boozy repetitions, to shed a side of me that was dangerous and destructive. I wanted to raze myself to ground zero and build myself back up again. Shaving my head felt like the most elemental and easy way to do it. Perhaps it was also a reaction against a conception of life as a sober person. It felt like an emboldening, a taking control of my identity, something anarchic and subversive in the face of a lifetime of Diet Coke, tea and early-to-bed. It also felt a bit brave, as if by doing it I could front away the fear of life without my crutch. In those early months, I felt raw, as if my skin had been removed, and having a shaved head somehow made me feel stronger.
When you find yourself drunk all the time, or hungover, your self-esteem can take a kicking. It took time to build mine back, but having a shaved head gave me a starting point. It also affirmed in me the simple concept of growth as intrinsic to life (well, for a while), that things change and move forward. Hair grows. Patterns can be broken. Neurons adapt.
The reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Friends seemed to like it, but elderly relatives? Not so much. My mother cried the first time she saw it, because she thought I looked ill. A friend’s mother told me it looked awful and scary. My grandmother was upset because it reminded her of images of people in Nazi concentration camps. I was a lot more comfortable at a festival or in a city rather than the rural corners of Scotland or the news desk of the newspaper where I was working at the time.
It is true that, historically, a shaved head is associated with some pretty bad stuff. Deposed emperors in Byzantium would have their heads shaved, along with castration and disfigurement. The Merovingians shaved the heads of dethroned kings or failed successors. French women who slept with German soldiers in the second world war had their heads shaved and were then paraded through the streets. It has been used as a tool to shame, dehumanise and mark in different cultures. It’s not all bad, though: Grace Jones said that shaving her head led directly to her first orgasm.
I kept my head shaved for a couple of years, enjoying the ease of my husband getting his clippers out, not costing a penny, wash and go. I loved the way my scalp felt like a velvety vole. But in a way, it was high maintenance. It required makeup and a proper outfit. And growing it out was a bore.
The finer details of the cash offer still needed to be ironed out and approved by the local council, Galliano wrote on his Facebook page. But if all goes ahead, from next year anyone who transfers their residence to Bormida and either rents or buys a property there will be gifted €2,000.
“We’re still working out the plan, but anyone is welcome to come and live here,” said a local councillor, who asked not to be named. “We’re a small community but very welcoming. We’re high up in a mountain area but also not far from the sea – it’s a healthy lifestyle, the air is very clean.”
But what is life like in Bormida? The manager of Oddone Giuseppe, one of the town’s four restaurants, said: “There is nothing much to do here. But life is so simple and natural, we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food. Life would definitely be free of stress.”
A report last year by Legambiente, an Italian environmental association, found that 2,500 villages across the country risked being abandoned owing to depopulation.
In January the culture ministry named 2017 the “year of the village” as part of an attempt to promote tourism in places at risk of becoming deserted.
Designer and artist James Jacob dreams of a quiet revolution; he sees the considerate design of everyday objects as a medium to change the world. “I’m most inspired by a poetic, purposeful form of design,” he says. Since graduating from Kingston University, where he studied product and furniture design, Jacob has worked on individual concept art and collaborative furniture-making briefs. He is also involved in the Baum Studio project, a new initiative to create affordable oak tables “made to last 100 years”.
In the toilet area, Geberit’s Monolith + AquaClean Sela is well suited to his overall design: “The toilet is allowed to hold its own, relaxed space. A toilet is an ordinary object, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be beautiful.”
 Some great design double acts are just meant to happen. Such was the case for Issy Spence and Oliver Jack, who met while working together on the University of Bath’s flagship Basil Spence project, a final-year challenge exploring students’ knowledge of civil engineering and architecture.
Geberit’s AquaClean Mera is positioned between the sink and shower. “The design of the toilet lends itself really well to that space,” says Jack. “Sitting next to the white subway tiles, it becomes an elegant, integrated part of that wall.”
A recent graduate of Kingston University, Harry Grundy studied on a conceptually-led graphic design course – a programme that very much suited his philosophy. “My approach puts the idea at the centre of the work,” he says.
Bluff graduated in classical civilisation, and her appreciation for archaeology has been a solid foundation for an interior design career. “My first job was in Kelly Hoppen’s studio,” she says. “I was inspired by her high-end, minimal products. In 2015, I started Topology, a blog and affordable interior design service. A few months later, it won a small business prize and was shortlisted for an interior design blog award.”
Contributing to Geberit’s 21st-century bathroom project, Bluff captured unique and innovative trends from across the interiors industry. “One idea was bringing the outside in,” she says. “I live in London, where exterior living walls are really popular; this inspired me to include a vibrant living wall behind the shower.”
With a nod to designer Abigail Ahern, Bluff also included dark grey walls to create a cosy feel: “The dark palette is balanced by a skylight, allowing natural light to flood in. Metallic touches add a hint of elegance to the overall look.”
Bluff says Geberit’s AquaClean Mera was perfect for her contemporary space: “Its sleek, cutting-edge design ensures everything in the room is super modern.”
 With a background in fashion, Sarah Al-Taib turned to interiors as a mature student. After graduating, she moved to Brighton, where she works as a freelance commercial interior designer on projects including hotel redesign.
Inspired by mid-century principles, Al-Taib’s retro design for the Geberit 21st-century bathroom brief captures the vintage spirit of colour and decadence, balanced with a peaceful ethos.
“I allowed the geometric pattern of the wallpaper to influence the whole look,” she says. “Geberit’s look is very modern, so I used a retro print to add character, but kept the overall design fresh and modern. I wanted it to have touches of retro luxury and the peace-driven 60s/70s ideology.”
Placing a freestanding bath on a raised area in front of a wide window, and complementing Geberit’s AquaClean Tuma with a floating sink unit, gives Al-Taib’s space depth. Light and air is allowed to move around and underneath the fixtures.
Picking up on the same theme, Farage tweeted: “A giant deceit has been voted for today. Macron will be Juncker’s puppet.”
As well as praising Le Pen in recent weeks, Farage declared in a TV interview on Sunday morning that the 48-year-old had “lost weight” and was “looking pretty fit”.
Katie Hopkins tweeted a picture of the pair and the caption: “Macron’s wife has promised him a special new toy from the shops tomorrow for being such a clever little boy.”
Echoing a line used by Le Pen in a televised debate with Macron on Thursday, Simon Richards, the CEO of the libertarian group the Freedom Association, said: “Macron evidently likes older women, so he’ll make an excellent lapdog for Angela Merkel.”
Politics is hardly at its best right now, and that is perhaps the greatest challenge facing us. The weakness of politics undermines democracy – the faith behind politics. But democracy is crucial because climate change is also about justice: how to distribute the costs of decarbonisation and the transition to renewable energy fairly among rich and poor, developed and developing, large and small, north and south.
The best-case scenario for what is likely to be done through nation-based environmental programmes hardly dents the worst-case scenario for the catastrophic consequences of all that is not being done.
However, there is an ample menu of sustainable options available to cities wishing to address climate change aggressively – and they can amplify their impact by coordinating their policies. The list includes divestment of public funds from carbon energy companies; investment to encourage renewable energy and green infrastructure; municipal carbon taxes; fracking and drilling bans; new waste incineration technologies; regulation of the use of plastic bottles and bags; policies to improve public transport and reduce car use; and recycling.
Such approaches can be undertaken to great effect one city at a time, but they are also mutually reinforcing: networks of collaborating cities can amplify their global impact. They can also make it more difficult for courts or governments to oppose environmental initiatives, standing firm on common approaches to sustainability and decarbonisation.
There are two formidable obstacles blocking a larger role for cities: a paucity of resources and the absence of autonomy and jurisdiction. The European Union favours regions over cities, and works more on agricultural subsidies than affordable urban housing. In the United States, the structure of congressional representation means a suburban and rural minority rules over the urban majority.
Because urban citizens are the planet’s majority, their natural rights are endowed with democratic urgency. They carry the noble name of “citizen”, associated with the word “city”. But the aim is not to set urban against rural: it is to restore a more judicious balance between them. Today it is cities that look forward, speaking to global common goods, while fearful nations look back.
The world is getting too hot. Science makes it clear that sustainability is both necessary and possible. Politics shows it is achievable. Cities are poised to make it happen.
A 40-33 victory for Umaga’s Blues over the NSW Waratahs in Sydney and the Chiefs’ 46-17 thrashing of the Queensland Reds in New Plymouth extended New Zealand’s collective winning streak over Australian teams in the competition to 23 matches – and 17 this season.
Only a massive upset in any of the eight remaining trans-Tasman home-and-away fixtures can deny the Kiwi dominators a 25-0 clean sweep of their Australian counterparts in 2017.
Umaga suspects the ongoing uncertainty around which Australian team will be cut from the competition in 2018 is taking its toll.
“We all know that there’s been some tough things going on over here and not just on the field, obviously off the field, so that’s unsettling,” he said after his Blues consigned the Waratahs to a fourth straight loss at Allianz Stadium for the first time since 1999.
“It’s pretty tough to keep everyone on an even keel when you’re always looking over your shoulder wondering what if and what could happen, and so that’s tough.
“There’s some quality players and staff involved in these groups and they’ll get it back on track, but I suppose what everyone’s looking for is a decision to be made so everyone can know what’s happening. That’s just how it is and we’re taking advantage of that, obviously.”
Asked how the under-performing – but safe – Waratahs and Reds could blame the Sanzaar situation for their on-field woes, Umaga said: “I’m sure they wouldn’t see that as an excuse. It’s just the lay of the land. It’s reality.
“If you talk about players and staff, and the uncertainty of it, it’s like anything; if you’re in employment and you don’t know what’s going to happen from year to year, you can’t say that it’s not unsettling.”
Australia’s struggles aren’t restricted to New Zealand rivals.
The Melbourne Rebels’ 47-10 home loss to the Lions and the Sharks’ 37-12 defeat of the Western Force in Durban leaves Australian franchises with just three wins from 31 matches against all overseas opposition this campaign.
The Kiwis also continue to rule South Africa, with the unbeaten Crusaders’ 62-24 rout of the Bulls in Pretoria completing another weekend sweep for the powerful New Zealand conference.
The Hurricanes came from behind late to see off the Stormers 41-22 in Wellington, but the titleholders’ comeback paled into comparison to the Highlanders’ against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein.
The 2015 champions trailed by 17 points before piling on three tries in the last five minutes to snatch a 45-41 victory. In the final match of round 11, the Jaguares edged the Sunwolves 46-39 in a high-scoring thriller in Buenos Aires.
I’m a sucker for the American west as seen from a bus and I loved the wild, magical, almost mystical portrayal of the landscape in this coming-of-age road movie by Andrea Arnold. I also loved the tender relationship between the main character, who has run away to join a circus-like group of teenage sales people in the US, and the animals she keeps trying to save. Her familiar longing to save these little creatures from an unpredictable world is almost godlike and echoes the viewer’s desire to see her and her young friends safely delivered to a better future.
Sorry to choose a reissue for the music choice. I have to admit that at some point, I think my late 30s, I decided I had enough music to last me a lifetime and stopped being hungry for new stuff. Music still feels like a lifeline to me but like most other middle aged people, I’d rather listen to music I’m already familiar with. When I left London, I gave away or sold my record collection, most of which was covered in candle wax and jam. I still find it thrilling and the greatest possible luxury to be carrying around all my music in my pocket and be able to find whatever I’m looking for within moments. But I digress. I chose this album because it’s just been rereleased and so counts as something sort-of new. I completely missed Elliott Smith the first time round, I’m not sure how, and was introduced to this album by my husband. It’s now one of my all-time favourites – it’s start-to-finish absolute perfection. I don’t have much tolerance for sad music, but this is gentle and smart and somehow weirdly comforting, and it’s not depressing at all.
I’m so ashamed that I bought the lie that Bernie had no chance of being elected if he won the Democratic nomination. Looking back, I think that was totally wrong. I’ve been ignoring American politics since I’ve lived here, partly because the system seems so messed up and partly because I believed Obama was genuinely a good guy and if he couldn’t do it, it couldn’t be done. Reading this book was a huge eye-opener. I’ve also woken up to the fact that I need to start paying attention and doing what I can. I was just in South Carolina with a friend, helping to register voters for the special election there in June. I hope the extremity of what is happening in the US now gives birth to a truly progressive revolution. The Women’s March was incredible and it’s been heartening to see how many grassroots campaigns are springing up.
Ram Dass was a big-shot Harvard psychology professor in the 60s [under the name Richard Alpert], until he found himself in the office next door to Timothy Leary, which led to drinking the Kool Aid and getting himself very publicly dismissed. In an effort to find a more sustainable high, and to seek the origin of the truth he had glimpsed while taking psychedelics, he traveled to India and found his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. He came back to the US and became one of the archetypal 60s spiritual teachers who spread the teachings of the east to the west. He’s funny and wise and I love him. This book is a recently compiled collection of his writings. Ram Dass is in his eighties now and has lost the ability to speak fluently after suffering a stroke, so this book is read by his pal Rameshwar Das, who does a great job.
The gap was down to two lengths at the line, Rhododendron having powered past the third-placed Daban, but the winner had kept on too gamely, having had a trouble-free run up the centre of the track. Moore said “yes” when asked if he had been unlucky in running but stopped short of claiming he ought to have won.
Asked what would have happened if he’d had a clear run, the jockey replied: “I don’t know. She travelled beautifully and just when I needed to be making my run, I ran out of room at an important stage. She obviously ran a very good race and the winner’s a very good horse as well. I think they’re two good fillies.”
Moore’s weekend may have ended in frustration but he can still look forward to riding both Guineas winners in their future races. O’Brien, meanwhile, was completing a double in the Newmarket Classics for the third time in his career. He ran horses in five Group races here over the weekend, winning four and coming up just a neck short in the other.
For this 27th success in a British Classic, he has to be grateful for the retirement last year of David Wachman, who trained Winter as a juvenile.
Wachman, who won this race with Legatissimo two years ago, may now have some regrets about bowing out, though Michael Tabor, part-owner of Winter, doubted that.
“I think he’d be pleased as punch, knowing David,” Tabor said. “He’s a team player and if he wanted to train this year, he would be training her. But he’s got other ambitions, which I understand, and good luck to him.”
Another consequence of Wachman’s departure is that his jockey, Wayne Lordan, now works full time for O’Brien and achieved his first Classic success aboard Winter. Previously best known in Britain for winning top-class sprints on Sole Power and Slade Power, the 35-year-old adds significant depth to the roster of jockeys at Ballydoyle.
O’Brien’s mind must already be switching gears for the task of producing a credible Derby contender, with Epsom less than four weeks away. He surely cannot look to any of his three colts which took part in the Leopardstown trial on Sunday and were separated by just a neck at the line. “I don’t know if the Derby winner’s there,” Tabor said.
Tabor seems interested in the possibility of sending Churchill to Epsom but that would run counter to the established Ballydoyle modus operandi. There is a lot of stallion potential in a star miler and why ruin that by stretching him out to the Derby distance? O’Brien didn’t do that with Gleneagles two years ago and seems unlikely to do it this time, especially if he can win one of the trials over the next fortnight. Cliffs Of Moher looks a candidate if he lands Chester’s Dee Stakes on Friday.
Richard Hannon said here that his 2,000 Guineas runner-up, Barney Roy, is unlikely to be aimed at the Derby, despite appearing third in betting lists. The final decision will be made by Godolphin but the trainer expects to aim the colt at the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.
ITV Racing appear to have had a good weekend. Their 2,000 Guineas programme on Saturday achieved a peak viewing figure of 800,000, the broadcaster reported, compared to 610,000 on Channel 4 last year, when the race was a week earlier. This year’s average of 578,000 was up from 355,000 last year.

Britain has more billionaires than ever in what equality campaigners said was a clear sign the UK economy is only working for the few at the top.
“While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain’s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the rich list.
Today, the Hinduja Group employs more than 70,000 people and has global investments in a range of sectors including oil and gas, property, media and banking. Current projects include the transformation of the Old War Office in Westminster into a luxury hotel.
The Equality Trust said the £83bn increase in wealth among the richest 1,000 people over the past year could pay the energy bills of all UK households for two and a half years and would be enough for the grocery bills for all food bank users for 56 years.
Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust, said that an elite was sitting on mountains of wealth in the fifth largest economy of the world. “The super-rich continue to streak away from the rest of us, while the poorest see their wealth shrink. This is an economy working for the few, not the many,” she said.
“Record numbers of people visited food banks last year, millions are locked out of a decent home and two-thirds of children in poverty are in working households.
“We know that inequality damages our economy and society, and makes it harder for ordinary people and their children to get on. With the general election fast approaching, our politicians need to decide the sort of country they want to build. One where we can all prosper or one where we’re picking crumbs from the super-rich’s table.”
At least 28 of the top 100 individuals or families in the rich list have donated to the Conservative party or individual Tory politicians, according to the Electoral Commission’s records. Among them are David and Simon Reuben, third on the list, who donated to Boris Johnson.
Others in the top 10 who donated to the party include Guy, George and Galen Weston and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, who donated to the West Suffolk Conservatives.
The combined wealth of all the Conservative donors on the list is £102bn, according to the analysis by Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. “The fact that nearly a third of UK’s 100 richest people have given money to the Tories tells you all you need to know about where Theresa May’s priorities lie,” Watson said. “She claims to speak for working people but she’s beholden to the billionaires that bankroll her party.”
Watts said there was more diversity in this years’ rich list. “More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with private equity barons and hedge fund managers.”
Enlightenment values – tolerance, respect for the importance of fair debate, checked and balanced government, objectivity and impartiality, recognition of international interdependencies – are being trashed. Matters could get very ugly, very fast. It is not just Europe we are leaving, but an idea of Britain.
The chill can only increase as the scale of the gulf between Britain and Europe becomes clearer. If Britain does crash out of the EU, possibly with sanctions being imposed by our former partners because we refuse to pay what they consider are our proper financial obligations, there could be a further run on sterling, a collapse in overblown property values, a second banking crisis and a deep recession. Worse, the enmity towards Europe thus provoked will poison British popular attitudes, as we suffer a lost decade or more, as our weak economy struggles to compensate for lost markets in Europe. Any deal is better than no deal.
We need our principal opposition party to force potential responses into the national conversation – federalising the constitution to avoid the risk of national break-up, rebuilding our relationship with Europe, repurposing our economy and reaffirming a new social contract. These would address the challenges in a way that inspires hope. The shrunken Labour party and its leadership’s preoccupation with yesterday’s failed leftism will be incapable of holding May to account. Or, because of the weakness of its electoral support, it has not the heft to threaten political consequences if she backs off from confronting her party’s right and its media allies.
It is a perfect storm. Corbyn must be persuaded to promise that, in the event of the likely crushing defeat, he will stand down after the election, offering Labour MPs some chance of saving themselves and their party. It is improbable. Maybe Labour will be so broken that a new party, with roots in the best of the British working class and committed to Enlightenment values that unite the best of our political traditions, will have to be started with a clean slate. It’s going to be a long hard road ahead.
The three-time Olympian, three-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champion was 37.
“The only reason why the USA is in any conversation in the sport of bobsled is because of Steve Holcomb,” said US bobsled pilot Nick Cunningham, who roomed next to Holcomb in Lake Placid. “He was the face of our team. He was the face of our sport. We all emulated him. Every driver in the world watched him, because he was that good at what he did. It’s a huge loss, huge loss, not just for our team but for the entire bobsled community.”
No cause of death was immediately announced, but officials said there were no indications of foul play after the preliminary parts of an ongoing investigation were completed. USA Bobsled and Skeleton said it was believed Holcomb died in his sleep.
An autopsy was scheduled for Sunday. Funeral arrangements are expected to be finalized in the coming days.
“USA Bobsled and Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend,” federation CEO Darrin Steele said.
Holcomb was a native of Park City, Utah, and his signature moment came at the 2010 Vancouver games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold medal drought for the US in bobsled’s signature race.
“The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb,” US Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said. “Steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, and his perseverance and achievements were an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve’s family and the entire bobsledding community.”
Holcomb was still one of the world’s elite drivers, finishing second on the World Cup circuit in two-man points and third in four-man points this past season.
The final victory of his career was last December in Lake Placid. He won 60 World Cup medals in his career, 10 more at the world championships and three in the Olympics, making him one of the most decorated pilots in the world.
“You will be loved, missed and remembered forever,” US women’s pilot Jamie Greubel Poser wrote on Twitter.
Holcomb was an Eagle Scout and served as both a member of the Utah Army National Guard and the Army World Class Athlete Program. He was cherubic, almost always happy in public, someone whose sense of humor was well-known throughout the close-knit bobsled world. Teammates even spent a season chronicling his “Holcy Dance,” a little less-than-rhythmic shuffle that he would do at each stop on the World Cup circuit to make fellow sliders laugh.
But there was also a troubled side, including battles with depression and alcohol, plus a failed hotel-room suicide attempt involving sleeping pills in 2007 which he wrote about in his autobiography, But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold.
“After going through all that and still being here, I realized what my purpose was,” Holcomb said in a 2014 interview.
Winning gold with push athletes Steve Mesler, Curt Tomasevicz and Justin Olsen at the Vancouver Olympics turned Holcomb into a full-fledged star. In the months that followed, Holcomb met President Barack Obama, played golf with Charles Barkley, hung out with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Cleveland Indians game and went to the Indianapolis 500.
In the bobsled world, he was larger than life. “We’re all still in shock,” Cunningham said. “I don’t know if mourning will happen for a long time, because the shock part will take a while.”
And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (£78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn’t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (£356m).
One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: “Why did you do it?” At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: “I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.”
Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.
He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors’s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.
Why did I do it? I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer
Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?
“There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,” he says.
Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors’s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year’s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (£10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel “sick”.
“I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,” he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.
But it didn’t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. “I didn’t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,” he says. “It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You’re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don’t get to go outside and say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’”
Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn’t really see anyone who wasn’t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn’t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.
And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company’s liking. He did as he was told.
“Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?” he writes. “Should any such line be drawn at all?” I’m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?
“I think it’s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that’s what I wish I had done much earlier,” he says. “But it’s very easy for me to say: ‘Follow your own morals and it will be fine.’ But it won’t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you’ll begin to run into trouble.” He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it’s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.
I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. “I don’t want to say,” he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned “a seven-figure sum”. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.
“You get these bonus cheques, but there’s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I’ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.” At £1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.
But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn’t perform well, and he felt short-changed.
I didn’t think about the system as a whole. You never say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’
“Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It’s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn’t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It’s more like you’ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.”
Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.
I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says – he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. “The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.”
But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He’s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? “I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,” he says, “but I don’t think so.” He says he couldn’t do it without becoming obsessed again.
Does he miss the money? “Of course, it’s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn’t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.”
A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: “Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn’t spend much time thinking about it – at least not until it was too late.”
“That was the only thing that I really liked,” he says now. “Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.”
I think he should stick to lecturing.
Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time – but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.
During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo Häyhä. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when Häyhä was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: “I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.” Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed “snipers”. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees – no matter what their job description is.
I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.
I wouldn’t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I would become
“Don’t worry,” I was told. “We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.” I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee’s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.
Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.
What a difference a week makes. Xhaka felt the same injury here and he was removed from the fray in the 76th minute. This time Arsenal were 2-0 up and coasting towards victory in a game they had to win.
Xhaka departed to a rousing ovation. He had made the difference, turning the afternoon in his team’s favour with a deflected pot-shot, and no one could say the break was not overdue for Xhaka, who has endured a difficult first season in England after his big-money move from Borussia Mönchengladbach, or his club.
Arsenal were up and running, their early nerves a distant memory, and when the former United striker Danny Welbeck rose to head home Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain’s cross, after Anthony Martial had been robbed by Rob Holding, the die was cast. United had offered little in an attacking sense and, when they were asked to respond, it was no surprise they could not.
At the 16th time of asking Arsène Wenger could celebrate victory in a competitive match against a José Mourinho team. Arsenal will need a favour from elsewhere if they are to finish a difficult season in a Champions League position but at least they are still fighting.
As for United, this was the limpest of defeats and Mourinho’s post-match press conference, when he wrote off his team’s top-four chances and had a pop at Wenger for pressuring the fourth official, was much more entertaining than what his players served up on the pitch.
Yes, they had two clear first-half chances, which Martial and Wayne Rooney could not take; Rooney’s opportunity was presented to him by an errant Holding back-pass rather than any creativity on United’s part. Petr Cech stood tall on both occasions. But Mourinho’s post‑match performance should not be allowed to obscure his team’s failings.
Opportunity had knocked loudly for them after Liverpool’s home draw against Southampton earlier in the day. Once again United had control of their destiny in terms of the fight for a Champions League finish via the league. They surrendered it and a single statistic continues to damn them. They have not scored a single goal away from home against a top-six club this season – and that includes the 1-0 FA Cup defeat against Chelsea.
They do retain a shot at next season’s Champions League via the Europa League, where they are 1-0 up against Celta Vigo after the first leg of the semi‑final. Win that competition, return to the Champions League and, with the EFL Cup in the bag, the season is a success. Yet it is plain Mourinho has much work to do and what was remarkable about this defeat which ended United’s 25-match unbeaten run in the league was how meek the manager was about it.
United have been described as injury-ravaged but Mourinho was without only five players because of various ailments – Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. A sixth, Marouane Fellaini, was suspended.
Mourinho’s starting lineup was strong despite the eight changes he made from the first leg in Vigo last Thursday, although he was worried about how Phil Jones and Juan Mata would cope with their first football since late March. The same went for Chris Smalling, who had returned from a similar lay-off as a late substitute against Vigo.
Mourinho, though, would labour the point about how fatigued his squad are, having played three times each week since the beginning of April and certainly there was precious little spark about them.
Arsenal pressed on to the front foot, with United happy to attempt to counter-attack, and the home team had their chances in the first half. Aaron Ramsey drew a fine save out of De Gea from Alexis Sánchez’s through-ball; Welbeck was denied by a desperate Jones block following a corner; and Oxlade-Chamberlain tested De Gea with a deflected blast.
Mourinho had clashed with Wenger midway through the first half after the Arsenal manager complained to the fourth official about a tackle from Rooney on Oxlade-Chamberlain. The home crowd stirred but they truly crackled to life on the one-two punch from Xhaka and Welbeck. Rooney had a couple of efforts towards the end but United could have played on and on and not scored.
It was all very well for Minaj to help out fans from around the world with plane tickets, CJ thought, but what about those struggling in the US, who couldn’t even afford to go to school? “Well you wanna pay for my tuition,” she tweeted back at the star.
Six minutes later, Minaj replied. Sure, she said – as long as your grades are good enough:
Over the next few hours, a flood of other hard-pressed students joined CJ in putting out distress messages to Minaj. And the star duly replied, offering support to more than 30 of them in the form of tuition or help in paying off college loans.
“Got u,” Minaj replied.
Shortly after 1am, Minaj felt she had forked out enough promises of thousands of dollars and decided to call it a night.
Ok u guys. It's been fun. Let me make those payments tmrw then see if I have any money left😂. I'll do some more in a month or 2. 😘😘😘💋💋💋💕💕🎀🎀🎀
When we say “addict”, we rarely think of people aged over 65. You might think this is uncommon. It isn’t. People expect to live longer, so they’re not slowing down just because they’re in their 60s. It shouldn’t be a surprise that we are seeing substance misuse, dependence and addiction in older people: think how many old fashioneds Don Draper got through in each episode.
We are woefully unprepared to meet the needs of older people struggling with substance misuse. So what will happen in 2030, when members of Generation X – the twentysomethings who popped pills at warehouse raves in the 1990s – start to turn 65? Addiction in older age is not a problem that’s going to go away. By 2030, nearly a quarter of the population in England will be over 65. That’s around 12 million people. We’re sitting on a ticking time bomb, waiting for the inevitable fallout of each generation overindulging in its substance of choice.
Lifetime use of cannabis and cocaine in 65- to 74-year-olds increased seven-fold and five-fold respectively between 2000 and 2014. In the last 10 years, the number of people in that age group admitted to hospital for drug-related mental health problems, such as psychosis, rose from 181 to 1,345. Use of prescription drugs for pleasure is also on the rise in older people, with opiates and medication for insomnia often used for non-medical reasons. As addiction services are being dismantled, more baby boomers with illicit drug misuse are entering old-age psychiatry services. Snorting cocaine, smoking cannabis or experimenting with psychoactive substances shouldn’t raise the eyebrows of psychiatrists providing care in older people’s mental health services, but even I initially failed my MRCPsych exams for lacking the necessary expertise on substance misuse. I didn’t realise how central it was to old-age psychiatry.
We wrongly assume that substance misuse is a younger person’s problem and there are huge challenges in increasing access to services for older people because of this.
When they do, they need care that not only addresses misuse, but takes into account chronic physical health problems and mental health conditions such as dementia. Treatment also has to manage the normal physical pain of ageing and the unfortunate truth of social isolation and bereavement.
Sadly, I see a future in which poly-substance misuse in older people is common. We have a lot of catching up to do to provide services for substance abuse beyond alcohol and tobacco. Baby boomers are the generation that laughed off inebriation, saw alcohol advertised daily on television and thought relaxation was more about smoking a joint than mindfulness.
But at what age do we assume people “grow out” of the pub night three times a week or smoking cannabis? The “you’re only young once” approach can easily go from a relaxed attitude in middle age to dependence and addiction in older life.
Substance misuse in the over-65s may seem strange because we characterise older people as fusty, but it’s not surprising that the attitudes of youth carry into later life. If we continue to ignore substance misuse in people over 65, we are closing the door on ensuring their quality of life as 70, 80 or 90-year-olds. In 2017, that door is still barely ajar.

General manager Sandy Alderson announced the suspension in a brief statement before the game, saying that Harvey had been sent home but declining further comment. The team said the suspension was effective Saturday.
“We are going to keep it in house, the way it’s supposed to be,” manager Terry Collins said. “We hope to put it behind us and move forward.”
Left-hander Adam Wilk was called up from Triple-A Las Vegas to start in Harvey’s place. The three-day suspension removes Harvey from the 25-man roster. The Mets transferred Noah Syndergaard to the 60-day disabled list to open a spot on the 40-man roster for Wilk.
Collins indicated that he was aware that a suspension could be on the horizon for Harvey.
“There were some moves made last night because we felt this might occur,” he said.
In his first season after having a rib removed to treat thoracic outlet syndrome, the 28-year-old Harvey has struggled to a 2-2 record with a 5.14 ERA over 35 innings. Harvey is coming off two of the worst starts of his career, allowing 12 runs over 9 2/3 innings with eight walks in a pair of losses to Atlanta.
He missed the 2014 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Harvey’s best season was in 2015, when he went 13-8 with a 2.71 ERA. But that year, in his first postseason, he missed a mandatory workout the day before the NL East champion Mets traveled to Los Angeles for their playoff opener against the Dodgers. He apologized for his late arrival, for which he was fined. Harvey offered no public explanation for his tardiness, saying he simply “screwed up.”
Harvey’s suspension is the latest blow for the Mets, who have been plagued with injuries this season. New York is missing ace right-hander Syndergaard (latissimus dorsi), outfielder Yoenis Cespedes (hamstring), first baseman Lucas Duda (elbow), catcher Travis d’Arnaud (wrist), left-hander Steven Matz (elbow), right-hander Seth Lugo (elbow), third baseman David Wright (recovery from neck surgery) and outfielder Brandon Nimmo (hamstring). Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera left Saturday’s game with an injured left thumb.
The team already has dealt with several public relations issues this season. Syndergaard initially missed a start with what the Mets said was biceps and shoulder discomfort and then made his next start against Washington after refusing to undergo an MRI. He was removed with the lat injury after only 11 batters. Syndergaard issued an apology Saturday to Mets public relations director Jay Horowitz and to members of the media for an outburst on April 27.
Backup catcher Kevin Plawecki was at the center of a controversy Friday when a sex toy could be viewed in his locker in a photo the Mets tweeted of T.J. Rivera wearing the star-of-the-game crown after New York’s come-from-behind victory.
Collins had a closed-door meeting with the team to address the situation, which Plawecki described as a prank.
Similarly, what does the supreme leader mean by “community”? It appears more than 80 times in his message, so it must be important. Close reading suggests that Zuckerberg hasn’t the faintest idea of what a real community is: a social group comprising people who don’t agree on everything (think of an English village) but who have devised ways of getting along and doing what needs to be collectively done.
“The reason the idea – that community-building on a planetary scale is practicable, necessary and altogether good – did not seem ‘controversial’ in the beginning was,” observes Carr, “that Zuckerberg, like Silicon Valley in general, operated in a technological bubble, outside of politics, outside of history. Now that history has broken through the bubble and upset the algorithms, history must be put back in its place. Technological determinism must again be made synonymous with historical determinism.”
Carr is right. The best reason for reading the Zuckerberg epistle in full is that it provides the best illustration we have of the degree to which Silicon Valley has become detached from reality. En passant, it also shows how someone can be both staggeringly clever and also astonishingly naive. Facebook’s supreme leader is not an evil person. He just knows little about the world that actual human beings inhabit.
There is also, I am sorry to say, a less charitable explanation. It is that he has concluded that what is wrong with the world – all the fanaticism, cruelty, warfare, myopia and xenophobia – is because some parts of the world are not yet on Facebook. If only they were all part of that mythical “global community” then everything would be OK.
In June 2013, a young American postgraduate called Sophie was passing through London when she called up the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.
“That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.”
Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”
Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”
On that day in June 2013, Sophie met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she suggested he meet this firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.”
Who’s her father?
“Eric Schmidt.”
Eric Schmidt – the chairman of Google?
“Yes. And she suggested Alexander should meet this company called Palantir.”
I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of eBay and PayPal, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump.
In some ways, Eric Schmidt’s daughter showing up to make an introduction to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.
It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.
There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.
Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign.
What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.
It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”.
How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.”
AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished.
There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.
Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.”
He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said.
Who’s Chris Wylie?
“He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.”
There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.”
I did find Chris Wylie. He refused to comment.
Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”.
I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.
What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.
SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.
This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”
Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.
And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.
Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.
The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.”
Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.
But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?
“It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.”
Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.
“We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.”
A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform.
David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.”
These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”.
In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?
It makes me think again about the story involving Sophie Schmidt, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.
Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.
A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.
“On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.”
In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.
The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.
Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.
The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”.
On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook.
Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”.
And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.”
The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.
But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”.
And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer.
This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.”
Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.”
Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.
“He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.”
On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.
I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.
“I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.”
It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.
And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.
For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.
Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America.
Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.”
This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn’t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics. It’s about the first step into a brave, new, increasingly undemocratic world.

“I know nobody wants to hear it but I am brave enough to say it. The pitch was really dry today. We gave it all the water we had but after 15 minutes it was really dry again with the wind. It was difficult. You could see it … a lot passes you thought ‘why are they playing this?’ But it was difficult. In a possession game you need to have the best circumstances, if possible, in a home game especially, but today we couldn’t have this. That is nobody’s fault; it is only a description.
“It is not nice to drop points at home but now we play away and then we have another home game. We really still enjoy playing at home. It is only a mental issue if you think it is one. We don’t see this. The boys like it here, they like playing in front of their crowd. That is all. Today the atmosphere was really good. People were really in the game. Everybody tried everything and it didn’t work out finally.”
“It’s very frustrating,” Milner said. “Obviously the penalty is my fault and the fact we didn’t get three points is definitely my fault. I have to live with that. Fraser is a top keeper. You have to take those chances. I’ve been around long enough to make sure that doesn’t worry me. I can’t do any more than hold my hands up. Southampton are a tough team to break down.
“We didn’t play as well as we would have liked. The penalty was a big chance and we didn’t take it. We have to win our remaining two games [to be sure now of a top-four finish].”
But these new ambulances, equipped with sirens and a doctor on board, will exclusively serve injured cows, in the latest of a series of high-profile schemes to improve the wellbeing of the animals, which are revered by most Hindus.
He said the ambulance service had received about 200 calls and was able to attend to about 25 cows a day.
For the past 20 years the trust has been running a similar low-cost ambulance service for rickshaw pullers and rural labourers, and it added cow welfare to its agenda in the past two years.
Sanjay Rai,chief trustee, said he had been interested in helping to protect cows for nearly a decade but had lacked financial resources to establish an ambulance service. “And there was no support from the government side,” he said.
The new state administration of Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu revivalist, has been more encouraging and had allocated the ambulance service a toll-free number, he said. “On a verbal basis they support us, but for financial support they have not started anything yet,” Rai said.
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, won office in 2014 campaigning for a national ban on cow slaughter, and under his tenure there has been a surge in projects to improve the animal’s welfare.
The other side of the growing zeal to protect cows is increasing violence against those perceived to be harming them. In Rajasthan last month a dairy farmer, Pehlu Khan, was attacked by a mob and died from his injuries after being caught transporting cattle.
Movements to protect the cow first became prominent in India in the late 19th century, accompanying a growing political consciousness among Hindus. The issue has frequently been a trigger for tension with India’s sizeable Muslim minority, and has become increasingly charged since Modi’s election in 2014.
Most Hindus eschew beef, but the meat is consumed by some in the country’s south, by many of India’s religious minorities, and by traditionally poorer castes who regard the animal as a cheap source of protein.
Critics of Modi and the broader Hindu nationalist movement argue the threat to cows is overblown and that the animal’s welfare is being used to whip up anti-Islamic sentiment among the Hindu majority.
Macron, 39, a former economy minister who ran as a “neither left nor right” independent promising to shake up the French political system, took 65.1% to Le Pen’s 34.9%, according to initial projections from early counts.
His victory was hailed by his supporters as holding back a tide of populism after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s victory in the US election.
He promised to unite a divided and fractured France, saying: “I will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.”
Speaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago, he said: “Everyone said it was impossible. But they didn’t know France!”
Turnout was the lowest in more than 40 years. Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen, with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers.
Macron, who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago, is France’s youngest president. Next Sunday, he will take over a country under a state of emergency, still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment. France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war.
François Bayrou, an ex-minister and Macron’s centrist ally, said: “He is the youngest head of state on the planet [which] sends an incredible message of hope. Macron is giving hope to people who had no hope. Hope that maybe we can do something, go beyond the [left-right] divide that no longer makes sense.”
The outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, who was once Macron’s mentor and had appointed him economy minister, said: “His large victory confirms that a very great majority of our citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union and show France is open to the world.”
Macron’s victory came not only because voters supported his policy platform for free market, pro-business reform, and his promises to energise the EU, coupled with a leftwing approach to social issues. Some of his voters came from other parties across the political spectrum and turned out not in complete support of his programme but to stop the Front National.
In a political landscape with a strong hard left and far right, Macron faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! (On the Move!) in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises.
In Brussels and Berlin, there was relief that Le Pen’s anti-EU, anti-globalisation programme was defeated.
A spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said it was a “victory for a strong and united Europe” while the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said French voters had chosen a “European future”.
The office of the British prime minister, Theresa May, said she “warmly congratulates” Macron on his victory and “we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities”.
Macron, a former investment banker and senior civil servant who grew up in a bourgeois family in Amiens, served as deputy chief of staff to Hollande but was not part of the Socialist party.
 The rightwing candidate, François Fillon, once seen as favourite, was badly damaged by a judicial investigation into a string of corruption allegations, including that he paid his wife and children generous salaries from public funds for fake parliamentary assistant jobs.
The ruling Socialist party, under its candidate Benoît Hamon, saw its score plunge to 6%, while the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon finished fourth.
The final round marks a redrawing of the political landscape, away from the old left-right divide towards a contest between a liberal, pro-globalisation stance and “close the borders” nationalism. Le Pen has styled the election as being between her party’s “patriots” and the “globalists” whom she says Macron represents.
It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened
But it’s Monday morning, he’s just woken up, and he’s in no mood to enter that headspace. When I remark that the album has more darkness and meditations on mortality, he yawns and says, “Maybe, I dunno. Maybe I was just being a jackass.” Has he picked up any adult life skills recently? “Uh I don’t think I have very many… fuck. Ummm. I learned how to wipe my own ass last week,” he guffaws (the joke is later reprised several times). His preferred way of starting an answer is “I dunno”.
Two sides coexist in the DeMarco universe: one laid-back and sunny, one more introspective. A casual listen to the album doesn’t immediately reveal the ruminations within: the music sounds upbeat and melodic, there are odes to love (inspired by his long-term girlfriend), guitars twang serenely. Yet, DeMarco’s father looms large throughout. In opener My Old Man, DeMarco sings about becoming more like his father – “Uh-oh, looks like I’m seeing more of my old man in me” – a relatable-enough sentiment, made more touching by the knowledge that his father is an alcoholic and an addict whom he hardly knows.
Nevertheless, he warns against taking this too literally. “Anytime I see myself becoming something that I don’t necessarily agree with, that’s kind of what I’m talking about there, I guess,” he says. “But that can be taken in several different ways. Take it like a trope or whatever. It doesn’t matter – it’s a pop song.”
The album was written months ago, when his father had become very ill: the last song goes: “The thought of him no longer being around / Well sure it would be sad but not really different / And even though we barely know each other / It still hurts watching him fade away.” Although his father’s health has now improved, the two are still not in touch. Did exploring these issues on the album change the way he views his father? “Um, no. I mean, I was trying to understand it. But I don’t know, I really don’t. It just solidified [the fact] that I don’t understand.”
A much happier relationship is with his girlfriend, Kiera McNally. They met aged 14, got together five years later, and are still together seven years on (“almost eight”, she chirps in the background). The album’s love songs are varied – some are about past fights (“I never meant to make her cry”), some about fluctuations of affection (“sometimes my heart may seem awful cold”), one harks back to the feeling of “seeing her for the first time”, others are inspired by emotions from the distant past.
Considering that a lot of music is about break-ups or falling in love, is it harder to find inspiration in a contented, settled relationship? “It still comes,” he says. “I think that just being in love – being out of love, being in love, being confused by love, wanting love, not wanting love, being scared of love – it doesn’t matter which. There are so many things better than feeling nothing at all. Long-term relationships are like a fucking mountainscape, you know? Things go up, things go down. That’s the fun of it.” What’s his top relationship advice? “Be kind. Be respectful. And be real.”
DeMarco has always railed against the “cool guy fantasy” of rock stars being separate from fans: “the idea of that sexy guy in the band, dark and tall and handsome, looking at his shoes like, ‘Don’t talk to me’ – that has been so unappealing to me for ever.” Most of the fans he encounters are excitable young kids, with the occasional surprise. “It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened a couple times.”
But he also likes to throw curveballs about his life into the mix: he told one interviewer that Kiera has sadly passed away; he informed an audience they had broken up. Recently he said in an interview that he had become a father, prompting family members to get in touch to congratulate him; his mother said it almost gave her a heart attack. “The whole thing with the internet,” he says with a groan, “it’s the wild west. People read into things too much – it’s all horseshit and I like to treat it that way and have fun with it.”
I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth – it’s so twisted
He’s unlikely to repeat the experiment in his new place. He has just bought his first house, which made him feel “kind of weird and old”, after moving from New York to Los Angeles last August (“No real reason why – it just seemed a happening place, so it was like, ‘let’s go give it a shot’”). Now that he’s in LA, has he started to see the appeal of yoga and juice cleanses? “Nah, I don’t think so. I don’t like a juice, I like a smoothie, I like the chunkiness – a smoothie is halfway to a milkshake, and I’d have milkshakes every day if I could.”
It isn’t easy to get a strong opinion out of DeMarco, prime purveyor of contemporary slacker rock (in terms of sound rather than work ethic). What makes him angry? “I don’t get genuinely angry very easily. I don’t know. A whole number of different things. It’s hard to pinpoint what.” I try to stir him up a little. What does he think of life under Trump? “A lot of people are really put out, sad, disappointed… but I dunno. It’s not that it’s not my place to talk about American politics, but it’s a little complicated.” How worried is he about nuclear war? “If we got nuked I’d probably be fried before I even noticed it, which would suck, but would I know? Hopefully nuclear war doesn’t happen, that would really blow ass.”
How does he feel about social media? “It’s bizarre, but I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth. Kids have been led to believe that the number of likes you get on a post or something is equal to your popularity or how cool you are – it’s so twisted and evil. It’s really fucked up and scary, and it’s getting scarier.” He does have Twitter and Instagram accounts but rarely touches them; one of his most recent tweets, from last October, simply reads “#jarjarbinks”.
Social media has also meant that footage of his wilder live shows – nudity, drinking, a notorious incident involving a drumstick – live on online. “When those kinds of things happen it’s usually because I’ve had an off show,” he says. “What I try to focus on is try and play as well as I can and make sure everybody’s happy.”
Until then, does he have any pearls of wisdom to impart? “Nah, I’m good,” he says. “Just tell everybody to brush their teeth twice a day – keep it fresh.”
Mac DeMarco’s album This Old Dog is out now on Captured Tracks. He plays two sold-out nights at the O2 Academy Brixton, London SW9, on 30 and 31 May
But his victory is more a cause for relief than celebration. The new president has been audacious in his centrist campaign based on a new movement, En Marche!. He has also been incredibly lucky in his rivals. Until this second round, he spoke for a quarter of his compatriots at best. At various stages, François Hollande, Manuel Valls, Nicolas Sarkozy, Alain Juppé, François Bayrou, Benoît Hamon, François Fillon, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Ms Le Pen all threatened. Yet, one by one, the contenders knocked themselves out. He has a huge task of consolidation, particularly given that more than a third of French voters supported a far-right, anti-European, anti-immigrant and racist party leader, right up to the end. There is nothing to salute there.
Pizzas, like Chrises, Lesleys or Sams, mostly come in two types. The first type – let’s call it Category A – is the sort you can make very easily from scratch in a regular oven, buy frozen, or order from a standard high-street takeaway. The really important thing about Category A pizzas is the cheese. Provided the cheese has melted and there’s plenty of it, you can hide all manner of sins.
What we feared most of all on our side of the counter was people asking for refunds because the food had been “cooked wrong”. The difficult truth was that no cooking of any kind could have improved the food we sold. The best bet in the whole park was the pizza parlour, which gloried under a comically racist name like Greasy Silvio’s or Flirty Paulo’s Pizza Place. Not because the pizza was any better than anything else, you understand, but because if you slather enough cheese even on the cheapest, most overpriced topping, most people will eat it.
That’s Category A. Then there’s Category B, which you can make at home provided you have a pizza oven and a great deal of patience. The art of a good Category B pizza is mainly in the base – a thin disc of dough, and proper tomato.
What both categories have in common is that, provided you get the essential element right, people will forgive an awful lot. Your Category As can survive the grittiest of pepperoni, the lousiest olives, or pineapple of any kind or quantity, provided they’re laden with melted cheese. Your Category Bs can weather the most pretentious of artichokes, the most obscure mushrooms, the faddiest truffles, as long as the base is crisp and the tomatoes fresh.
And just as there is no greater horror that realising that Chris, Lesley and Sam are all men, there is nothing quite as disappointing as getting a Category A pizza when you want a Category B, or vice-versa for that matter.
Because although a lot of food writing presents Category A pizzas as something you graduate from when you discover Category B and better things – a bit like going to school, but with more grease and less trauma – the truth is that both types of pizza have a time and a place.
Category A pizzas aren’t just the stuff that high-margin, low-quality chains make their money with. They’re also the food that provides plenty of social grease along with the actual grease: at cinemas, while playing cards, Fifa, Cluedo, watching boxsets or Eurovision. There’s an awful lot of emotion in the average bite of a Category A pizza. There’s not a lot of emotional resonance in a trendy sourdough pizza. Unless you are Italian, or loaded, a thin crust and fresh tomatoes will not remind you of your teenage years. A soggy middle, coagulated cheese and dubiously sourced ham will.
According to the Washington Post, its reporter’s phone was grabbed by event organisers who blocked attempts to interview investors and ordered reporters to leave. “This is not the story we want,” a PR representative was quoted as saying.
Similar events at five-star hotels were scheduled to follow in at least three other Chinese cities: Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
On Sunday afternoon investors were due to gather at the Four Seasons hotel in Shanghai’s glamorous former French concession, according to one Shanghai-based consultant for Qiaowai. “Invitation is free of charge,” the consultant told the Guardian. “If you offer to invest in the project, then you would sign a contract and have certain fees to pay.”
It is not clear whether Kushner’s sister will also speak at those sessions but Qiaowai’s website said a number of “VIP guests” would be present including Ben Curtiss, the vice-president of Kushner Companies. Investors would have “opportunities to speak with these distinguished guests”, Qiaowai’s website promised.
The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”
The suspicions that Canelo Álvarez’s pay-per-view showdown with Julio César Chávez Jr was a sideshow not worthy of your time, say nothing of the hefty $70 price tag, proved founded early in Saturday’s one-sided beatdown on the Las Vegas Strip. This one was more of an event than a fight: a celebration of Cinco de Mayo featuring two of Mexico’s most popular boxers masquerading as authentic sports experience for fans.
Álvarez won every minute of every round against an opponent who is his rival in narrative only. Not once during the 12-round mismatch, which took place at a contracted catchweight of 164½lbs, did the popular red-headed puncher from Guadalajara sit on his stool between rounds. One could imagine Canelo suffered sparring sessions in training camp more taxing than Saturday’s light workout before a sold-out crowd at the T-Mobile Arena. When it was over, all three ringside judges turned in identical scores of 120-108, as did the Guardian. A total whitewash and, candidly, a bit of an embarrassment.
“GGG, you are next my friend,” the 26-year-old Álvarez, a former champion at junior middleweight and middleweight and the presumptive face of the sport in boxing’s post-Mayweather age, said through a translator. “The fight is done. I’ve never feared anyone, since I was 16 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone. I never got my share of fear. I’m very happy, and the rivalry is going to show my skills even more. I’ve had difficult fights, and that will no doubt be a tough fight. But, I always say, Canelo Álvarez is the best because I fight the best.”
The shrewdly timed announcement, an inspired piece of stagecraft which speaks volumes about what Canelo’s handlers thought of Chávez’s chances, was a convenient way to make people forget about what they had just watched.
Chávez (50-3-1, 32 KOs), a former middleweight beltholder who lost his strap to the great Sergio Martínez five years ago, was so drained at Friday’s weigh-in that he looked ready to pass out, prompting fears he might come out even slower due to the weight cut. Those fears, it turned out, had merit. The son of the greatest fighter in Mexico’s rich fistic history labored to produce anything resembling an offense and Canelo, who dictated the distance, standing mid-range unmolested in what felt like acres of space, got off first time and again. By the end of the third round, a trickle of blood ran from the bigger man’s nose.
By the sixth, Canelo was simply walking Chávez down, setting up his punches beautifully, unconcerned with single-shot return fire, landing as many per round as his opponent was throwing. Even when Chávez had openings to uncork, he couldn’t pull the trigger. Thus he appeared content to lay back in an effort to extend the fight, perhaps endowed with the grim self-knowledge that any resistance would only hasten his demise.
By the ninth, Chávez’s left eye was nearly fully closed and a feeling of discomfort seemed to prevail among the well-lubricated capacity crowd of 20,516, who had started the night bellowing singalongs in the stands to Mexican standards Tragos Amargos and La Ley Del Monte but had now descended into cascades of boos. For what exactly? Certainly not the surgical work of Álvarez, who gave no quarter in the so-called championship rounds in his effort to close the show. The bloodletting was on and it was hard to understand how anyone could feel particularly good about bearing witness to the punishment, which truly should have been stopped by referee Kenny Bayless or any sane party. For years Chávez’s commitment has been called into question, and correctly, but no one can doubt his chin: even from a smaller man these were devastatingly hard shots.
The 31-year-old Chávez, who earned a guaranteed $3m for his trouble (compared to $5m for Álvarez), managed to finish the bout upright but nothing else. Few at ringside could remember the last time a fight put forth as a top-flight contest had ended with all three ringside judges failing to find even one round to give the loser.
“Tonight I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things,” said Álvarez, who landed 228 of 604 punches (37.7%), compared to 71 of 302 for Chávez (23.5%). “I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn’t do it. I’ve shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings. I’ve shown I can showcase myself.
“I wanted to try something new. I never sit down in sparring and I didn’t want to sit here.”
Said Chavez, also through a translator: “I wanted to box but he went to the ropes and I just needed to throw more punches. I would’ve attacked more I would’ve been countered by his punches. [Trainer Nacho Beristain] told me to do that but the strategy didn’t work.”
Now the eyes of the boxing world turn to the hotly anticipated meeting between Canelo and Golovkin, who watched from ringside on Saturday night.
“The fight is signed, sealed and delivered,” said Oscar De La Hoya, who promotes Álvarez. “I’ve already had several calls from people interested in staging this fight. I have a missed called from Dubai. I have a missed call from the UK where Anthony Joshua and (Wladimir) Klitschko just sold out 90,000 people. There’s interest from all over the world. There’s interest from everywhere.”
De La Hoya said the fight was “not tough at all” to make, adding that negotiations began several months ago but were halted out of respect for the Chavez fight. The Golden Boy Promotions founder said they restarted negotiations a few weeks ago and the contract was signed this week.
That set the stage for Saturday’s dramatic rollout. As Canelo conducted an in-ring interview with HBO’s Max Kellerman after the fight, the lights went down immediately when he announced Golovkin would be his next opponent. A video teaser played on the big screen as the Kazakh emerged from the tunnel to the ominous seven-note guitar lick of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army, his traditional ringwalk song.
“I feel very excited, right now is a different story,” Golovkin said. “In September, it will be a different style. A big drama show. I’m ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100% the is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September.”
Golovkin, 35, is coming off a points win over Daniel Jacobs at Madison Square Garden two months ago, his 18th straight middleweight title defense. It marked the first time in 24 fights he’d been extended the full distance, snapping a near-decade-long knockout streak that extended back to when he was fighting eight-rounders during the George W Bush administration. In that span he’s absorbed three of the four major world title belts at middleweight, while Canelo is lineal champion by virtue of his career-best win over Miguel Cotto in November 2015 (though, notably, that bout took place at a catchweight of 155lbs, five below the division limit).
“Everyone understands this is a tough fight for both of us,” Golovkin (37-0, 33 KOs) said afterward. “This is amazing fight for everyone. Of course, I respect his team. Everybody wanted this fight.”
Opening the region to international trading routes would significantly empower northern Syria, circumventing the existing blockade on Rojava caused by the closed border with Turkey and tensions with Iraq.
The SDF’s liberation of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor along the Euphrates would extend territory controlled by the autonomous federation of north Syria to almost a third of the country, compared with the 16% that was governed by the federation of Rojava.
Yousef said that the population of Raqqa would be given a referendum asking if it wanted the SDF, which contains Arab and Assyrian Christian militia, to form a government following the defeat of Isis.
A spokesman for the US State Department said that Syria’s future should be made by the Syrians themselves, reiterating Washington’s position as not recognising “any unilaterally declared self-rule semi-autonomous zone”.
In a letter to Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the House armed services and intelligence committees, a defense official, James MacStravic, said the apartment is “privately owned and … lease negotiations have been with the owner’s representatives only”.
MacStravic, who wrote that he was “temporarily performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics”, said any acquisition of leased space with “an annual rental in excess of $1m must first be approved by my office”.
He “approved this action” after consulting with the White House Military Office and other officials, he said.
Officials declined to reveal the cost of the lease or identify the owners of the apartment.
MacStravic’s letter, dated 3 March, added: “We are not aware of any means through which the president would personally benefit from a government lease of this space.”
The letter explained that the White House Military Office, a Pentagon unit, “requested approval to lease space in the Trump Tower for personnel assigned to support the President when at his private residence”.
The letter said such arrangements were “typical of support provided” by the Military Office to previous US presidents and vice-presidents at their private residences. It is not clear, however, whether the office has ever paid to rent space to house the classified equipment presidents need when they are staying at homes they own outside Washington.
A White House spokeswoman had no information on the leasing issue. The Trump Organization did not reply to an email requesting comment.
When the Pentagon first acknowledged that it was seeking to lease space in Trump Tower, some Democrats questioned whether such a move would produce a financial windfall for Trump.
“I am concerned by the appearance that the president of the United States will financially benefit from this deal at the expense of the Department of Defense – and ultimately, taxpayers,” Speier wrote to the defense secretary, James Mattis, shortly after the Trump Tower issue became public in February.
By negotiating only with representatives of the owners of a private apartment, the Pentagon said it was seeking to avoid such concerns.
Under Ireland’s Defamation Act 2009 a person who publishes or utters blasphemous material “shall be guilty of an offence”. A conviction can lead to a fine of up to €25,000.
While being interviewed on The Meaning of Life TV programme, Fry was asked what he would say to God if he had a chance.
“I’d say ‘Bone cancer in children, what’s that about?’ How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault,” Fry replied. “It’s not right. It’s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?”
Fry said if he met the Greek gods he would accept them quicker because, “they didn’t present themselves as being all seeing, all wise, all beneficent”.
“Because the god who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish. We have to spend our lives on our knees thanking him. What kind of god would do that?”
“I told the garda I wanted to report Fry for uttering blasphemy and RTÉ for publishing/broadcasting it and that I believed these were criminal offences under the Defamation Act 2009.
“The garda then took a formal written statement from me in which I quoted Fry’s comments in detail. This written statement mentioned both Fry and RTÉ specifically.”
He said he was asked by the garda if he had been personally offended by the programme and if he wished to include this in the written statement.
“I told the garda that I did not want to include this as I had not personally been offended by Fry’s comments – I added that I simply believed that the comments made by Fry on RTÉ were criminal blasphemy and that I was doing my civic duty by reporting a crime.”
After hearing nothing for 18 months, the complainant wrote to the head of the Irish police, Commissioner Noirín O’Sullivan, “asking if the crime I reported was being followed up. A few weeks later I got a standard ‘we have received your letter’ from her secretary.”
But recently the man was contacted by a detective from Donnybrook garda station in Dublin (the same suburb where RTÉ is headquartered) to say they were looking into the blasphemy claim. “He said he might have to meet me to take a new more detailed statement.”
“I was merely saying things that many finer heads than mine have said for hundreds of years, as far back as the Greeks ... I never wished to offend anybody who is individually devout or pious, and indeed many Christians have been in touch with me to say that they are very glad that things should be talked about.”
The host of the The Meaning Of Life programme, Gay Byrne, said “Of course [Fry] hadn’t wished to cause offence. But that’s what the internet is for, controversy, debate and people’s opinions.”
Tuvalu – population 11,000 – and Kiribati – 107,000 – are low-lying archipelago nations in the Pacific acutely vulnerable to climate change, in particular to rising sea levels that have already begun inundating land and homes across the islands.
The World Bank paper argues a structured migration program instituted now would prevent a more harried, forced migration in future generations.
“The worsening impacts of climate change have provided a new moral imperative for providing open access,” the report says.
It forecasts, with open migration, about 1,300 i-Kiribati and Tuvaluans would migrate to Australia and New Zealand annually, about 0.6% of those countries’ combined annual permanent migration programs.
“The two governments would prefer a slow outward flow resulting from voluntary migration and do not wish their peoples to be treated as ‘refugees’ fleeing a hopeless economic and environmental situation.”
Seventeen people from the Pacific – including 11 from Tuvalu and five from Kiribati – have already made refugee claims in New Zealand, citing climate change as part of their basis of claim. None have been successful (four have yet to be determined and 13 have been rejected) because the refugees convention does not recognise climate change as grounds for protection.
Report author Prof Stephen Howes, from the Australian National University, said unrestricted access across national borders was unusual but it did occur, with some Pacific nations, such as the the Federated States of Micronesia, granted open access to the US, effectively borderless travel between Australia and New Zealand, and free movement within the EU.
“But there has to be something very special, very important to allow that free movement. It seems to us that climate change might provide such unusual circumstances as to give rise to open access.”
He stressed that the migration to Australia and New Zealand was not “about emptying out those countries” but with making them sustainable, economically and environmentally.
Howes said it was important to have a pathway to permanent migration for Pacific Islanders coming to Australia and New Zealand, so that they could form diasporas that could assist later generations of migrants.
“If you don’t have that avenue for permanent migration, you won’t establish a diaspora, and the most successful migrant communities we’ve seen, for instance, the Indian community in Australia, thrive because of the personal and community links an established diaspora provides.”
Open access migration for all Pacific Islanders has been proposed by a number of Australian thinktanks, as a more effective mechanism than aid for lifting struggling Pacific states out of poverty.
Based on conservative assumptions, an uncapped migration model could increase the income of some Pacific Island countries – for the entire population, not just emigrants – by 300 to 400% over the next 25 years.
“We are conscious that this focus is a different way of thinking about development but conventional thinking is clearly not working in the Pacific.”
“The time is now ripe for Australia to reconsider how it engages with the Pacific workforce,” the Menzies report says. “Forecasts for labour demands suggest that the domestic labour supply will not be sufficient to meet demand in sectors like aged and community care, agriculture and tourism and hospitality. They are sectors with jobs that workers from the Pacific are potentially well-suited to fill.”
Launching the Menzies Research Centre report, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia had a substantial aid program in the region, focused on infrastructure, health, education, security and defence.
“But foreign aid alone will not deliver economically sustainable and independent nations,” she said. “That’s why we’re focusing on seeking to build the economies of our Pacific Island neighbours.
“Australia has some of our labour force shortages met but those from the Pacific gain skills, gain an opportunity, gain access to Australian qualifications, see Australian business practices and of course send home remittances.”
Australia’s relations with the region are expected to be a key element of the government’s forthcoming migration white paper. Australia has run a seasonal workers program since 2012 – which has attracted some criticism over worker exploitation – and, since last year, a Pacific microstates-northern Australia worker pilot, which provides multi-year visas for up to 250 workers from Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru.
Bishop’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said climate change migration was not a priority.
“Australia believes that the best response to climate change impacts, where feasible, is effective adaptation and well-supported internal relocation rather than resettlement.”
Jason Woodward, the New Zealand‑born full-back who joined Bristol from the Hurricanes last autumn, has been included in an England training squad that will gather on Tuesday for a strength and conditioning camp.
Woodward, who spent two years with the Rebels in Melbourne but left before he qualified to play for the Wallabies on residency to have a tilt at the All Blacks, is one of nine players in the 20 who will gather in Teddington but are not in the squad for the summer tour to Argentina.
Woodward has a year on his contract left with Bristol but it is believed to contain a release clause and he has been linked with a move to Gloucester. A year in the Championship would hinder his England ambitions, with Jones saying this year that he is looking for competition for Mike Brown at full-back.
Jones ruled out Woodward before the start of the Six Nations Championship, saying that he was looking for a player with explosive pace and citing two three‑quarters, Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly, as potential alternatives, but the 26-year-old stood out for Bristol in a season that ended with relegation and he has played in the centre and on the wing.
Care’s rival in the England squad, Ben Youngs, has pulled out of the British & Irish Lions squad for the tour to New Zealand because the wife of his brother Tom has a terminal illness. The Lions gather in London on Monday to be kitted out and the Scotland captain, Greig Laidlaw, will be present having been called up to replace Youngs.
Fears that another scrum-half, Ireland’s Conor Murray, would be forced to withdraw from the Lions squad because of a shoulder injury he sustained during the Six Nations lifted on Saturday when he came off the Munster bench during the 50-14 victory over Connacht that took them to the top of the Pro 12.
“Rock music is a belief system, in a way, and Brian Epstein dedicated everything to the Beatles and to their success. His main concern was their well-being,” said Deller. “In terms of its characters and stories, the way we feel about rock’n’roll music since the Beatles is like religion, or at least an alternative belief system.”
“I am taking a straightforward visual approach to marking the album,” said Deller, who last summer collaborated with the National Theatre’s artistic director Rufus Norris to arrange for hundreds of volunteers to appear across the country dressed as first world war soldiers. “Epstein is someone I have been thinking about for a long time. Without his contribution and sacrifice, the Beatles would not exist as we know them and a lot that we take for granted in our culture would not exist either.”
“Epstein was the band’s friend and helped them more than a little bit,” said Deller. “He was one of a handful of people they could trust.”
The introduction to the book began: “Brian Epstein’s contribution to popular culture is so immense that it is almost too large to comprehend. This might explain why he has been largley written out of the narrative of British popular culture.”
Deller concedes that Epstein is now remembered in the name of a Liverpool theatre, but argues that the Beatles’ manager has not been recognised for the sort of “ultimate sacrifice” that was, at least metaphorically, equivalent to martyrdom.
Epstein came across the band at the Cavern Club in November 1961 and shepherded their early careers. A gay man, he was forced by the laws of the time to keep his private life secret. He was found dead in his bedroom on 27 August 1967, having overdosed on sleeping pills. Homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales a month after his death.
The surviving Beatles, McCartney and Starr, are also to release an anniversary edition package on 26 May, including a new mix of the album by Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin, and Sam Okell that will feature 34 previously unreleased recordings.
This system is deemed to be democratic because people elect governments and can always vote them out; it’s capitalist because corporations are constrained by the logic of competition, which prizes efficiency, innovation and infinite expansion. That logic, with its penchant for creative destruction of all things stale and permanent, can produce toxic results – which is precisely why government action is needed. Such, at any rate, is the social democratic consensus accepted by both centre-left and centre-right parties.
The questions of war and security – and the existential imperatives that they impose on the most democratic of societies – have always posed unresolved challenges to this framework, as can be glimpsed from occasional warnings about the military-industrial complex expressed by many a political insider nearing retirement. Thus, standard democratic procedures are regularly suspended as governments demand tighter control over the flow of information, classify more of their internal communications and expand surveillance without any requisite checks and balances.
The standard critique of such practices attacks the undemocratic-because-unaccountable activities of the so-called “deep state”. Rooted in campaigns to defend privacy, opponents aim to make the deep state shallower – ideally by means of legal interventions aimed at restoring transparency and accountability. The real problem, they argue, is with the malfunctioning of democracy – we could easily ignore the capitalist part of “democratic capitalism”: we just need more and better legal instruments to tame the intelligence agencies.
Governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies – they are engaging in toxic activities of their own
Alas, the world in 2017 is not so easy to pigeonhole into the neat compartments of this scheme. Consider just one example: cyber-security. Plenty of rogue states are, indeed, busy hacking the servers of their adversaries in western Europe or North America. Likewise, there’s no denying that non-state hackers, operating for commercial or patriotic motives, have damaged their targets.
They do this for motives that some might view as noble: to identify early signs of terrorist activity, to track down criminals, to disable devices that might be part of sophisticated plots to wreak havoc on our cities. Whatever the motives, we should not lose sight of the larger political effects produced by such actions.
First, the expansion (and even the maintenance) of the surveillance capabilities of democratic governments presupposes a permanent structural insecurity of our communication networks. That insecurity, in turn, gets exploited not just by democratic governments but by anyone else, including all those rogue states and non-state hackers. However, once insecurity is structural, the right response is not more security, but more insurance. This explains why cyber-insurance has become one of the most promising segments of the insurance market, with even sectors like manufacturing (itself increasingly wired up and interconnected) needing to spend more and more to insure against disruptive cyber-attacks.
In essence, cyber-insurance – like any other form of insurance – is a domain of rentiers who are keen to extract a regular premium payment from those needing their services. The truly innovative element here is that the risk that creates this new class of rentiers exists partly – and, one could even say, mostly – because of government activity.
Here, the logic of democratic capitalism is no more: governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies; rather, they engage in toxic activities of their own, which companies mitigate with activities that are either more or less toxic – depending on one’s views about the parasitic nature of economic activities pursued by rentiers. The second political effect of the ever-expanding surveillance apparatus is the disadvantage it creates for small companies and non-profits, not to mention individuals. Remember the early utopian vision of a digital world, where we would all be running our own mail servers and, with time, might even master our own version of the connected home?
Well, today we demand more autonomy at our own risk: given the sophistication of cyber-attacks – which both aim to steal data and overwhelm sites with fake traffic – it’s obvious that the only actors capable of defending ordinary users, be they individuals or corporations, are big tech firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This, too, violates the basic premise of democratic capitalism: citizens are encouraged to seek protection from companies, not governments.
When both spam and security threats are assessed using the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, one can forget about any other, smaller player being able to compete with such firms that use the structural insecurity created by governments to further consolidate their near-monopoly status.
Democratic capitalism is thus always democratic monopoly capitalism – and even more so in its digital version. The idea that the normal imperatives of capitalist competition would exert extra pressure on digital giants seems quaint. There’s no garage big enough to house a startup that can unseat Google, not with its trove of customer data and artificial intelligence.
The third effect of this new post-democratic compromise is that, in presenting cyber-insecurity as a natural rather than human-made problem, it delegitimises the role of law – and politics in general – in mitigating conflicts between citizens and corporations. Consider how we deal with other types of disasters. It would be imprudent to rely on the power of law and politics to ward off floods and earthquakes; insurance, under these conditions, is not an unreasonable option. But none of this prevents us from requiring stricter building standards so as to minimise the damage when the disaster does strike.
The world of cyber-security does not follow this logic. Imagine if the government regularly dispatched a group of well-paid and well-educated saboteurs to weaken the anti-flood or anti-earthquake defences of our houses, leaving us no option but to turn to the private sector for security, either in the form of better defences or better insurance. This is the situation we are in right now; the only difference is that cyber-security disasters are almost entirely human-made and thus avoidable.
Rhetorically, the governments might even agree that, in the face of all these dangers, we all need to strengthen our privacy laws. In reality, though, we all know that it would only result in them sending even more saboteurs – with even more powerful tools – to weaken our defences. Who, under these conditions, would retain any faith in law and politics, rather than accept protections promised by the market, however flawed and expensive?
Cyber-security, alas, is just one of the many examples where the legitimacy of democratic capitalism – as well as of the social democratic parties that have traditionally defended it – has expired, even if its talking points are still in circulation. No wonder that social democratic parties are collapsing, as elections in the Netherlands and France have shown: they claim to be defending a system that no longer walks the talk.
The author also said Donald Trump “sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m”.
“Trump was strutting up and down, talking to his new members about how they were part of the greatest club in North Carolina,” Dodson said. “And when I first met him, I asked him … you know, this is the journalist in me … I said, ‘What are you using to pay for these courses?’ And he just sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m.”
Eric Trump, the president’s younger son who is now executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, was also present.
Dodson continued: “So when I got in the cart with Eric, as we were setting off [to play], I said, ‘Eric, who’s funding? I know no banks – because of the recession, the great recession – have touched a golf course. You know, no one’s funding any kind of golf construction. It’s dead in the water the last four or five years.’
He said, ‘Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia'
“Now that was three years ago, so it was pretty interesting.”
He also said: “And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”
Dodson, meanwhile, recounted a meal of cheeseburgers and being enveloped in a “bro hug” by Trump, and said: “You know, I liked the guy. I liked him. I mean, he was somebody you’d like to play golf with.”
“And I told Arnold that the next night at dinner and he laughed and said, ‘Really, Shakespeare? It’s more like this.’ And he crossed his hands and put them at his own throat.”
Three Australian swimmers are facing two-year bans from all competitions for missing three drugs tests over a period of 12 months.
“Swimming Australia confirms it has recently been informed by Asada and Fina that members of the Australian Dolphins Swim team may have failed to update their whereabouts appropriately over the previous 12-month period,” the Australian team said in a statement on Sunday.
All athletes in registered drug testing pools of international federations and national anti-doping organisations are required to provide their whereabouts for one hour every day (between 5am-11pm) when they will be available for testing. Asada said that at the point of each missed test, athletes have the opportunity to put forward an explanation before a missed test declaration was made.
Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson said he would be disappointed if protocols weren’t followed by the swimmers. “Both Swimming Australia and our athletes have been very clear on our position in relation to anti-doping both here in Australia and internationally,” Anderson said in a statement. 
“The Australian Dolphins Swim Team has worked hard to develop a culture of professionalism and respect. Part of that professionalism is ensuring each athlete is accountable and responsible for accurately providing their locations so testers can access them when required. It is extremely disappointing if this has not occurred as it should.”
Similarly, what does the supreme leader mean by “community”? It appears more than 80 times in his message, so it must be important. Close reading suggests that Zuckerberg hasn’t the faintest idea of what a real community is: a social group comprising people who don’t agree on everything (think of an English village) but who have devised ways of getting along and doing what needs to be collectively done.
“The reason the idea – that community-building on a planetary scale is practicable, necessary and altogether good – did not seem ‘controversial’ in the beginning was,” observes Carr, “that Zuckerberg, like Silicon Valley in general, operated in a technological bubble, outside of politics, outside of history. Now that history has broken through the bubble and upset the algorithms, history must be put back in its place. Technological determinism must again be made synonymous with historical determinism.”
Carr is right. The best reason for reading the Zuckerberg epistle in full is that it provides the best illustration we have of the degree to which Silicon Valley has become detached from reality. En passant, it also shows how someone can be both staggeringly clever and also astonishingly naive. Facebook’s supreme leader is not an evil person. He just knows little about the world that actual human beings inhabit.
There is also, I am sorry to say, a less charitable explanation. It is that he has concluded that what is wrong with the world – all the fanaticism, cruelty, warfare, myopia and xenophobia – is because some parts of the world are not yet on Facebook. If only they were all part of that mythical “global community” then everything would be OK.
Instead, the paper went with images of Prince Harry kissing his girlfriend and a story about insurance companies being unscrupulous.
Macron’s victory did make it onto the front of the Daily Telegraph, but the historic news was presented solely in relation to how it could impact Britain’s exit from the EU. The paper’s page one headline made no mention of the far-right candidate being beaten by centrist Macron and instead warned that his victory “puts cloud over Brexit”.
It was a sentiment echoed – albeit via far fewer column inches – by the Mirror.
Elsewhere, the Times and Financial Times played it pretty straight. The Times lauded a “landslide for Macron”, while the FT announced “Macron sweeps to victory” as French voters opted for “globalism over populism”.
With The Sun silent on the result, it was left to the Metro to inject a bit of fun and come up with what is arguably the best pun of the day.
In a letter to Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the House armed services and intelligence committees, a defense official, James MacStravic, said the apartment is “privately owned and … lease negotiations have been with the owner’s representatives only”.
MacStravic, who wrote that he was “temporarily performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics”, said any acquisition of leased space with “an annual rental in excess of $1m must first be approved by my office”.
He “approved this action” after consulting with the White House Military Office and other officials, he said.
Officials declined to reveal the cost of the lease or identify the owners of the apartment.
MacStravic’s letter, dated 3 March, added: “We are not aware of any means through which the president would personally benefit from a government lease of this space.”
The letter explained that the White House Military Office, a Pentagon unit, “requested approval to lease space in the Trump Tower for personnel assigned to support the President when at his private residence”.
The letter said such arrangements were “typical of support provided” by the Military Office to previous US presidents and vice-presidents at their private residences. It is not clear, however, whether the office has ever paid to rent space to house the classified equipment presidents need when they are staying at homes they own outside Washington.
A White House spokeswoman had no information on the leasing issue. The Trump Organization did not reply to an email requesting comment.
When the Pentagon first acknowledged that it was seeking to lease space in Trump Tower, some Democrats questioned whether such a move would produce a financial windfall for Trump.
“I am concerned by the appearance that the president of the United States will financially benefit from this deal at the expense of the Department of Defense – and ultimately, taxpayers,” Speier wrote to the defense secretary, James Mattis, shortly after the Trump Tower issue became public in February.
By negotiating only with representatives of the owners of a private apartment, the Pentagon said it was seeking to avoid such concerns.
Muttonbird, sea plants and eel spines: these native New Zealand ingredients may no longer be components of many diets, but one woman and her cafe are trying to change that.
Jade Temepara, who is of Maori descent, set up Kākano just over a year ago in Christchurch. “Maori people are the unhealthiest, most unfit and most likely to have heart disease – and it’s because of our lifestyle,” says Jade. “Our cause is to bring our traditional food back, and to involve Maori people in the preparation.”
Part cafe, part social enterprise, Kākano was built with the help of the local homeless community on the site of the city’s old convention centre, which was destroyed by the 2011 earthquake. If you walked past it, you’d be forgiven for not noticing the low-rise Portakabin-style building, hidden behind rows of raised garden beds, which are planted with local herbs and vegetables. But it’s more spacious than it appears from the outside, seating 25 (there are an additional 40 seats out on the deck), and though decoration is minimal, the monochrome colour scheme, black and white photos and select few New Zealand handicrafts on display elevate the space.
The whole setup has a distinctly temporary feel, and that’s not by accident: it’s all designed to be “lift and shift”, and in June will be transported from this provisional site to a permanent location just around the corner.
Over the past year, Kākano has built up a strong following among locals, both Maori and non-, and also attracts tourists who, Jade says, “love our story”. Community classes held here – which teach adults and children how to grow and prepare their own food, from fermenting cabbage to gutting fish – always sell out.
But the joke soon became serious. Choco started producing and uploading her songs in 2013, but with new album, Sátira (Satire), released in March, as well as a forthcoming European tour, it’s now a full-time job. The album’s title alludes to the randy figure of Greek mythology, while its cover depicts Choco in a wedding dress with chocolate smeared over her throat. “The idea is to present something that generates confusion,” she says, mimicking a shocked face. “Are you a lesbian? Oh my God, is that chocolate?” Sátira comprises seven tracks – most of which have a heavy dose of reggaeton’s signature tinny percussion and synth-led melodies, over which Choco raps in torrents of staccato and sometimes squeaky Spanish.
There was, however, a backlash from women who said her explicit videos and songs, just like those of male artists, were objectifying women. “It was a sensitive subject at the time. If you saw a women in mini-shorts people were like ‘Argh! That’s machismo,’” explains Choco. “I said, it’s great we are analysing this stuff, but what we are doing is putting more taboo on sex.” She also bumped up against an element of classism – reggaeton is grounded in street culture and is often written off as vulgar. “The idea of progress for middle-class Argentinians is that that you shouldn’t be a bitch, you should be intellectual and go to university,” she says.
Despite sticking two well-placed fingers up at the reggaeton establishment, Chocolate remains a “huge fan” of the genre’s megastars such as Daddy Yankee. “He’s not the bad guy,” she says, “he is just responding to the macho culture.” Would she be his support act? “Of course! But right now I don’t think my music is interesting to his audience. I’m presenting an alternative but I’m also saying ‘fuck you’.” She imagines the concert: “I’m there shouting, ‘Your dick is not important’ … Maybe with some years of talking and with some help from psychologists, they could accept it.”
The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”
Opening the region to international trading routes would significantly empower northern Syria, circumventing the existing blockade on Rojava caused by the closed border with Turkey and tensions with Iraq.
The SDF’s liberation of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor along the Euphrates would extend territory controlled by the autonomous federation of north Syria to almost a third of the country, compared with the 16% that was governed by the federation of Rojava.
Yousef said that the population of Raqqa would be given a referendum asking if it wanted the SDF, which contains Arab and Assyrian Christian militia, to form a government following the defeat of Isis.
A spokesman for the US State Department said that Syria’s future should be made by the Syrians themselves, reiterating Washington’s position as not recognising “any unilaterally declared self-rule semi-autonomous zone”.
Picking up on the same theme, Farage tweeted: “A giant deceit has been voted for today. Macron will be Juncker’s puppet.”
As well as praising Le Pen in recent weeks, Farage declared in a TV interview on Sunday morning that the 48-year-old had “lost weight” and was “looking pretty fit”.
Katie Hopkins tweeted a picture of the pair and the caption: “Macron’s wife has promised him a special new toy from the shops tomorrow for being such a clever little boy.”
Echoing a line used by Le Pen in a televised debate with Macron on Thursday, Simon Richards, the CEO of the libertarian group the Freedom Association, said: “Macron evidently likes older women, so he’ll make an excellent lapdog for Angela Merkel.”
Britain has more billionaires than ever in what equality campaigners said was a clear sign the UK economy is only working for the few at the top.
“While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain’s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the rich list.
Today, the Hinduja Group employs more than 70,000 people and has global investments in a range of sectors including oil and gas, property, media and banking. Current projects include the transformation of the Old War Office in Westminster into a luxury hotel.
The Equality Trust said the £83bn increase in wealth among the richest 1,000 people over the past year could pay the energy bills of all UK households for two and a half years and would be enough for the grocery bills for all food bank users for 56 years.
Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust, said that an elite was sitting on mountains of wealth in the fifth largest economy of the world. “The super-rich continue to streak away from the rest of us, while the poorest see their wealth shrink. This is an economy working for the few, not the many,” she said.
“Record numbers of people visited food banks last year, millions are locked out of a decent home and two-thirds of children in poverty are in working households.
“We know that inequality damages our economy and society, and makes it harder for ordinary people and their children to get on. With the general election fast approaching, our politicians need to decide the sort of country they want to build. One where we can all prosper or one where we’re picking crumbs from the super-rich’s table.”
At least 28 of the top 100 individuals or families in the rich list have donated to the Conservative party or individual Tory politicians, according to the Electoral Commission’s records. Among them are David and Simon Reuben, third on the list, who donated to Boris Johnson.
Others in the top 10 who donated to the party include Guy, George and Galen Weston and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, who donated to the West Suffolk Conservatives.
The combined wealth of all the Conservative donors on the list is £102bn, according to the analysis by Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. “The fact that nearly a third of UK’s 100 richest people have given money to the Tories tells you all you need to know about where Theresa May’s priorities lie,” Watson said. “She claims to speak for working people but she’s beholden to the billionaires that bankroll her party.”
Watts said there was more diversity in this years’ rich list. “More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with private equity barons and hedge fund managers.”
Indonesian authorities have said about 200 inmates remain at large two days after a mass escape from an overcrowded prison on Sumatra island.
The breakout at Sialang Bungkuk prison in Pekanbaru on Friday occurred when prisoners were let out of their cells to perform prayers. They broke through a prison door, overwhelming the few guards on duty.
Police said 242 men had been recaptured by Sunday morning, leaving about 200 still at large.
Authorities were initially uncertain how many prisoners had escaped, estimating the numbers at between 100 and 300.
Police said some of the men surrendered or were returned by their families and others were captured by local residents, police and soldiers.
Various officials have said the prisoners were angry about poor conditions and treatment. The prison has a capacity of about 360 but was holding more than 1,870 men, according to a local police spokesman, Guntur Aryo Tejo.
Tejo said four of the escaped inmates were apprehended by police late on Friday about 60 miles from the prison, on a bus heading for West Sumatra province.
Hundreds of police and soldiers have been deployed in the hunt for the prisoners.
Friday’s escape was the biggest since July 2013 when about 240 prisoners, including several convicted terrorists, escaped after a deadly riot at a prison in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province.
The answer, for Jenner, was to throw herself into athletics. “I was the fastest kid in school and the reason I trained so hard for so many years had a lot to do with who I was. It made me more determined than the next guy to go out there and compete.” Athletic success, and the public acclaim that came with it, would surely “fix” her nameless unease, but it didn’t, not even winning an Olympic gold medal in the decathlon in 1976.
Marriage didn’t work, either. Jenner met her first wife, Chrystie, while they were students at Graceland University in Iowa. They were both sheltered, she writes; Chrystie the daughter of a minister, Jenner, despite her status as a jock, someone who had at that point only slept with one other woman. They married in 1972 and had two children, although by the time Casey, the second, was born, the marriage had disintegrated. “I use the term ‘distraction’,” says Jenner, “as in ‘that was my next distraction, my children’. And I get all sorts of hell from my kids for that. My kids were not a distraction in my life – they were wonderful – but it was a distraction from myself, from who I was.”
In fact, for the next two decades, Jenner was so preoccupied with her own unhappiness, she was almost entirely absent from the lives of her first four children, to the extent that her daughter, Casey, didn’t invite Jenner to her wedding in 2007 – something she suffered terrible guilt about, she writes, but now seems to have fully recovered from.
One of the critiques of Jenner is that her wealth and celebrity is so wildly unrepresentative of the average transgender experience – as she is at pains to point out, transgender Americans face staggering rates of poverty and violence, with nine trans women murdered in the US this year alone and “all of them were trans women of colour” – that her example is worse than useless. To speak of “authenticity” in the context of Jenner’s transition has almost no meaning, when that transition has been so cushioned by privilege and compromised by profit motive.
“Part of my camouflage?” she says. “Hmm. That’s interesting. Was it part of me hiding away from who I was? I think it had a lot to do with growing up in the 50s and 60s, and having a World War II father who landed on Omaha beach, believed in this country, and I loved all its freedoms. I don’t like big government. The only thing that’s going to get this country out of debt is the American people. Get the government the heck out of here!”
Does she regret voting for Trump?
That would seem to be a fundamental issue, I suggest.
“But I’m not a one-issue voter. So I would rather fight the Republicans to do a better job when it comes to all LGBT issues, than fight the Democrats to lower taxes and give us less regulations out there for business.”
When Kris Kardashian met Bruce Jenner in 1990, he – Jenner tends towards use of the male pronoun when referring to her pretransition life – was pretty washed up. His days as a TV sports commentator were over and he hadn’t had a booking for a public appearance in eight years. They met on a blind date and married within a year, whereupon Kris fired his agents, stuck his name on a line of gym equipment and thoroughly rebooted his career. They had two children, Kendall and Kylie, whom they raised alongside the four children from Kris’s previous relationship, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robert, the future stars of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
The most startling revelation of the book is that when they met, Jenner had been on hormone replacement therapy for four and a half years and had a bust size of 36B. Before meeting Kris, she had been determined to transition before turning 40 and the main controversy over the book has been Kris’s suggestion – made on her TV show – that Jenner married her on false pretences. Jenner says this isn’t so and that she told Kris from the outset she had gender issues. “Did I downplay it some? Of course I did. Because I was coming up off six years of hell, and of course I wanted to get back into the game. I’m sure I downplayed it, because I didn’t think 25 years later I would transition.”
Kris knew you had been taking hormones?
“Yeah.”
I’m surprised that wasn’t a bigger heads up to her that you were trans.
“A lot of women have that can-do attitude and think I can fix this guy. And I wanted to be fixed, to be honest with you. I wanted to get back into work. We paired up and were a great team. It was 23 years of my life. We raised wonderful children. She was an extraordinary good business person. I owe her a debt of gratitude for getting me out of this hole and getting me back working. It was a very mutual decision to split. I didn’t leave to go transition.”
“Attention in terms of what?”
Getting your own reality show –
“Oh, I don’t care about that stuff! I just don’t care about another show. It didn’t even cross my mind. My intentions were number one, to calm my soul. To deal with this issue and be myself. This woman had lived inside me for 65 years, it’s time for her to live! Let’s give her a shot and see what she could do. Bruce has done everything! Had all his children, won the Games. This woman – it’s her turn! And that platform I have: can I make a difference in the world?”
There wasn’t a tiny part of you that wanted to upstage your ex-wife?
“Upstage her? No. I just wanted to be me. Kris is a good person – we’ve had our differences, especially now – but she saved my life in so many ways, she turned my life around.”
“She made you lots of money, let’s face it,” I say and for the only time in the interview, Jenner looks annoyed.
“Yeah but I don’t care about money. I’m not a money person.”
After the marriage ended, Jenner told her business manager, “OK, I’m playing in the fourth quarter of life and for the last 25 years, I haven’t done anything for myself. I will enjoy this money.” She bought a “few little toys” – a nice “3,500 sq ft house on top of a hill in Malibu with a great view, not some mansion of a monstrosity like all my kids live in. It’s a humble little place. I bought an airplane, just a small one, because I’ve always been into aviation and Kris didn’t like that, so I’d been out of it for 15 years. I bought a couple of little race cars.” She shrugs. As she says, she’s not a money person.
Did Jenner regret not having transitioned at the age of 39, giving herself 25 more years of life as she was meant to live it?
“No. I have no regrets.”
“You wouldn’t have had the Kardashians,” I say.
“Well, that’s not part of it, your soul, and being happy,” she snaps. “This is the deal: it’s very simple. It wasn’t time. The issue wasn’t where it is today. I had just a few minor things done to make me feel better about myself, and I thought I’m going to do this before my 40s – I’m not going to be an old chick. I don’t want to be an old chick. And I got to 39 and I couldn’t do it. For six years I had isolated myself in a house, didn’t date, didn’t go out. And I’m thinking, boy, maybe I should get back into the game. I’m just sitting here in this house, rotting away. I just don’t have the guts to do it. I married Kris with great intentions.”
The Kardashian kids have been supportive of Jenner’s transition, particularly Kim, although they were upset when Jenner excluded them from her first TV interview with Diane Sawyer two years ago. Jenner thought including the Kardashians would make the whole thing look like a “big joke”, so used the adult children from her first two families instead.
Since then, there has been no stopping her. She has become assertive on the issue of women’s rights, realising that, “in so many cases, women underestimate their power. They’ve been brainwashed growing up, being the girl, they’re supposed to be in the background and all that stuff. I don’t see that. I didn’t come to womanhood that way, by sitting in the back. OK?” As a result, she says, “I like to encourage women to be more powerful and stand up for yourself.”
I suggest that Jenner’s assertiveness as a woman is partly rooted in having lived her life to the age of 65 as a beneficiary of male privilege.
“Yeah!” she says cheerfully. “I would agree with that. I know the other side. I’ve been there all my life. But I want to use that to my advantage.” This is so honest, I’m somewhat taken aback. She goes on, “Some of the criticism that my community has had is that I’m white, I’ve got money, I’m privileged and all that kind of stuff. I get that. OK? Can’t do much about being white. Kind of born that way. Privileged? Yeah. I’ve worked hard all my life. I’ve tried to be as smart as I can and yeah, I’ve been successful from that standpoint. And I’m not going to apologise for that.” She chuckles. “Not even close.”
“Um. Yes. I’ve always been with other women. I think I say in the book that if I were to go through gender confirmation, I don’t know what my future would be.” I ask if the word lesbian – which I sense is problematic for Jenner – is appropriate and she seems to think I’m asking her whether, before her transition, she was attracted to men and says, rather quickly, “sexually, I was heterosexual. Was that a high priority – in what the public perceived to be this male, Olympic stud? Not even close.”
I mention all this because for the second half of our interview, it feels to me as if I’m interacting with an ego that, to use the language Jenner herself eschews, has been thoroughly socialised as male, to the extent that – and I apologise for this – after the interview, I inadvertently refer to her with the male pronoun, having to that point, and as is correct, referred to her exclusively as “she”. This does not undermine her journey, or the journey of any other trans person. But after hanging out with Jenner, it is impossible to avoid the sense that she is still deeply vested in the spoils that came to her as a result of the outward signifiers of her pretransition life.
Anyway, she says, she is not interested in sex. “I’m more excited about fighting battles for our community than I am about going out on a date.” Poor old community. It’s impossible to tell if Jenner does more harm than good, but if we are all, at this point, permitted to be the sole determinants of our own identities, then Jenner has the right to define herself precisely as she pleases. “It was hard giving old Bruce up, in a lot of ways,” she says. “He still lives inside me. I still do a lot of the things old Bruce used to do. I still fly airplanes and go race cars once in a while. I can have the best of both worlds.” She bestows on me her most dazzling smile. “I can live my life authentically, and still do all the fun stuff!”
“The vow is we must never, ever allow Forest to be in this situation again,” the relieved manager, Mark Warburton, said after the game. “Can’t happen. The last five or six weeks, the relegation dogfight, it’s not what we’re about. We told the players: ‘Remember the feeling at kick‑off’, and that must never happen again.”
Before the game at the City Ground Mick McCarthy promised that he wanted to give the Ipswich fans “something to smile about” despite having nothing to play for, but one imagines not many of the travelling support came away with grins on their faces. This was not so much a bad performance as a non-performance, unable to take advantage of the inevitable nerves from a relegation-threatened side.
Forest started with some purpose, going close through a curling Jamie Ward shot in the third minute, but the nerves showed when Jordan Smith fumbled a routine cross, like a child handed a valuable vase and sternly told to absolutely, 100%, under no circumstances break it. Shortly afterwards, though, Smith made a save that Warburton described as “world-class”, tipping the ball on to the bar while changing direction after a close‑range Grant Ward shot took a deflection. Given the nerves that showed in leaden legs and confused decision-making early on, that save probably kept Forest up.
Forest still looked jittery after the break, sitting deep and with little composure to their play. But after 57 minutes they doubled the lead: David Vaughan squared to the captain, Cohen, around 25 yards out and his shot took a flick off a defender on its way to the top corner. There could not have been a more appropriate and popular scorer than the club captain, making his 300th appearance after last season returning from his third cruciate ligament injury.
Ten minutes later Forest had the chance to remove all doubt, when professional irritant Ward won another penalty, this time barged to the ground by substitute Josh Emmanuel. Assombalonga stepped up and side-footed to Bialkowski’s left but the goalkeeper produced a wonderful save to tip the ball over the bar.
No matter, though. Five minutes later Assombalonga jinked down the side of the area, was shown on to his left foot by a backtracking Luke Chambers and, accepting the invitation, launched the ball into the roof of the net with that very foot. A few moments later Vaughan, as so often Forest’s most composed character in midfield, crunched into a (fair) tackle and, for the first time in a while at the City Ground, there was a sense that everything was going to be OK.
Warburton’s thoughts have already turned to the summer and next season, with a clear idea of how he wants to shape the squad with the help of Frank McParland, the director of football he called “the best in the business”. Warburton said: “We’re not proud of being in a relegation fight. It’s a muted celebration in that respect but the job’s been done and now we can build.”
At St James’ Park, goals from Ayoze Pérez, Chancel Mbemba and the substitute Dwight Gayle secured a deserved 3-0 victory against Barnsley in front of the owner, Mike Ashley, and a crowd of 52,276 at St James’ Park, and Jack Grealish’s last-gasp equaliser for Aston Villa denied Brighton victory to allow the Magpies to leap-frog them into top spot.
Rafael Benítez, the Newcastle manager, has insisted for weeks that promotion was the only objective, but as he prepares for the talks with Ashley which will determine whether or not he remains on Tyneside he will do so with a bonus piece of silverware sitting in the trophy cabinet.
Shorn of the services of Jamaal Lascelles and the winger Matt Ritchie through suspension and injury respectively, Benítez was forced to play the midfielder Isaac Hayden in central defence, although his problems grew when the former Arsenal man had to leave the field with a head injury. As a result, the Magpies were disjointed as they set about their task with Barnsley enjoying the better of the opening 15 minutes.
However, as the midfielder Christian Atsu roused them from their slumbers, they slipped into gear and took the lead with 23 minutes gone. Jonjo Shelvey expertly clipped Aleksandar Mitrovic’s lay-off into the path of Atsu, who cut inside the full-back Callum Elder before back-heeling the ball to DeAndre Yedlin to cross for Pérez to cleverly flick home.
The Barnsley goalkeeper, Adam Davies, did well to turn Atsu’s fierce shot over the bar after the winger had tricked his way past Elder with the visitors under intense pressure, and he excelled himself a minute before the break to deny the same man as he fired hard and low towards the far post.
The substitute Massadio Haïdara blazed over from 12 yards just before the break and Pérez tested Davies seconds after it as Newcastle dominated but struggled to kill off the game. That changed when Davies dived to save Pérez’s stinging 59th-minute effort, only for Mbemba to follow up from close range and make it 2-0.
Davies was called up once again 10 minutes later to tip over Mitrovic’s header and Shelvey struck the foot of the post two minutes later, but opposite number Rob Eliot had to make late saves from substitutes Marley Watkins and Elliot Lee to preserve his clean sheet. Gayle added a third at the death and news of Villa’s equaliser sent the home fans into raptures.
The Seagulls were already promoted, ending a 34-year exile from the top flight, and victory would have seen them go up as champions but they lacked urgency and rhythm for long spells.
Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said: “Today is a negative day, it’s difficult, but there are far more pluses. What these lads have achieved this season has been magnificent. David has been excellent for us all season and he had made two very good saves from free-kicks before. There’s never any portion of blame. We have to accept it as a team.
“For us the season is finished and we have achieved our goal. We’re playing in a division where there are some very big teams, who have spent big money, and we have managed to come in the top two.”
Brighton rode their luck in the first half and Henri Lansbury wasted a glorious Villa chance as the home side finished a disappointing season 13th with the manager, Steve Bruce, needing to revamp his squad in the summer.
Villa, relegated last year, had long hoped there would be a promotion party in Birmingham but it was the visitors who were celebrating going up – even if they struggled to get going. Lansbury’s low effort was shovelled wide by Stockdale during a low key start. It was competitive enough but there was little action until Lansbury somehow managed to head wide from five yards after Sébastien Pocognoli chested the ball into his path.
Brighton seemed too relaxed over their title chase and needed Stockdale to bail them out after another Pocognoli error after 33 minutes. The on-loan West Bromwich Albion defender played a blind backpass to slip in Scott Hogan but Stockdale deflected his shot wide and the goalkeeper was then needed again to save Conor Hourihane’s free kick.
There was little on offer from Brighton and they survived a huge penalty scare five minutes after the restart when Lewis Dunk tackled Keinan Davis but the referee, Darren Bond, waved away Villa’s protests. But the visitors suddenly woke up as Murray headed wide and then Baldock forced Sam Johnstone into a smart save just before the hour. And the title swung Brighton’s way when they went ahead after 64 minutes. Murray slipped in Baldock and he managed to scuff an effort at Johnstone, only for the referee to rule Baker had fouled him before he got his shot away. The defender was sent off and Murray scored from the spot, his 23rd goal of the season.
Four minutes later Brighton should have doubled their lead when James Chester blocked Baldock’s effort following Tommy Elphick’s short backpass. But while it remained 1-0 there was always a chance the Seagulls could lose the title and Stockdale had to produce a fine stop from Hourihane’s free kick with five minutes left. However, the 31-year-old then cost his side the league title when he allowed Grealish’s low 25-yard effort to sneak in with a minute left.

William talks of his “pain” and “shock”, plus “the humiliation heaped on his wife”. What he doesn’t explain, though, is why it’s necessary to revive all that pain and angst half a decade later – especially since, quite clinically, no French court is going to award him more than a (perhaps humiliating) fraction of the damages he seeks.
A future monarch needs a better legal advice team. Or maybe just have a word with the Duke of Edinburgh before he goes.

They had two children, Kendall and Kylie, whom they raised alongside the four children from Kris’s previous relationship, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robert, the future stars of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
The most startling revelation of the book is that when they met, Jenner had been on hormone replacement therapy for four and a half years and had a bust size of 36B. Before meeting Kris, she had been determined to transition before turning 40 and the main controversy over the book has been Kris’s suggestion – made on her TV show – that Jenner married her on false pretences. Jenner says this isn’t so and that she told Kris from the outset she had gender issues. “Did I downplay it some? Of course I did. Because I was coming up off six years of hell, and of course I wanted to get back into the game. I’m sure I downplayed it, because I didn’t think 25 years later I would transition.”
Kris knew you had been taking hormones?
“Yeah.”
I’m surprised that wasn’t a bigger heads up to her that you were trans.
“A lot of women have that can-do attitude and think I can fix this guy. And I wanted to be fixed, to be honest with you. I wanted to get back into work. We paired up and were a great team. It was 23 years of my life. We raised wonderful children. She was an extraordinary good business person. I owe her a debt of gratitude for getting me out of this hole and getting me back working. It was a very mutual decision to split. I didn’t leave to go transition.”
“Attention in terms of what?”
Getting your own reality show –
“Oh, I don’t care about that stuff! I just don’t care about another show. It didn’t even cross my mind. My intentions were number one, to calm my soul. To deal with this issue and be myself. This woman had lived inside me for 65 years, it’s time for her to live! Let’s give her a shot and see what she could do. Bruce has done everything! Had all his children, won the Games. This woman – it’s her turn! And that platform I have: can I make a difference in the world?”
There wasn’t a tiny part of you that wanted to upstage your ex-wife?
“Upstage her? No. I just wanted to be me. Kris is a good person – we’ve had our differences, especially now – but she saved my life in so many ways, she turned my life around.”
“She made you lots of money, let’s face it,” I say and for the only time in the interview, Jenner looks annoyed.
“Yeah but I don’t care about money. I’m not a money person.”
After the marriage ended, Jenner told her business manager, “OK, I’m playing in the fourth quarter of life and for the last 25 years, I haven’t done anything for myself. I will enjoy this money.” She bought a “few little toys” – a nice “3,500 sq ft house on top of a hill in Malibu with a great view, not some mansion of a monstrosity like all my kids live in. It’s a humble little place. I bought an airplane, just a small one, because I’ve always been into aviation and Kris didn’t like that, so I’d been out of it for 15 years. I bought a couple of little race cars.” She shrugs. As she says, she’s not a money person.
Did Jenner regret not having transitioned at the age of 39, giving herself 25 more years of life as she was meant to live it?
“No. I have no regrets.”
“You wouldn’t have had the Kardashians,” I say.
“Well, that’s not part of it, your soul, and being happy,” she snaps. “This is the deal: it’s very simple. It wasn’t time. The issue wasn’t where it is today. I had just a few minor things done to make me feel better about myself, and I thought I’m going to do this before my 40s – I’m not going to be an old chick. I don’t want to be an old chick. And I got to 39 and I couldn’t do it. For six years I had isolated myself in a house, didn’t date, didn’t go out. And I’m thinking, boy, maybe I should get back into the game. I’m just sitting here in this house, rotting away. I just don’t have the guts to do it. I married Kris with great intentions.”
The Kardashian kids have been supportive of Jenner’s transition, particularly Kim, although they were upset when Jenner excluded them from her first TV interview with Diane Sawyer two years ago. Jenner thought including the Kardashians would make the whole thing look like a “big joke”, so used the adult children from her first two families instead.
Since then, there has been no stopping her. She has become assertive on the issue of women’s rights, realising that, “in so many cases, women underestimate their power. They’ve been brainwashed growing up, being the girl, they’re supposed to be in the background and all that stuff. I don’t see that. I didn’t come to womanhood that way, by sitting in the back. OK?” As a result, she says, “I like to encourage women to be more powerful and stand up for yourself.”
I suggest that Jenner’s assertiveness as a woman is partly rooted in having lived her life to the age of 65 as a beneficiary of male privilege.
“Yeah!” she says cheerfully. “I would agree with that. I know the other side. I’ve been there all my life. But I want to use that to my advantage.” This is so honest, I’m somewhat taken aback. She goes on, “Some of the criticism that my community has had is that I’m white, I’ve got money, I’m privileged and all that kind of stuff. I get that. OK? Can’t do much about being white. Kind of born that way. Privileged? Yeah. I’ve worked hard all my life. I’ve tried to be as smart as I can and yeah, I’ve been successful from that standpoint. And I’m not going to apologise for that.” She chuckles. “Not even close.”
“Um. Yes. I’ve always been with other women. I think I say in the book that if I were to go through gender confirmation, I don’t know what my future would be.” I ask if the word lesbian – which I sense is problematic for Jenner – is appropriate and she seems to think I’m asking her whether, before her transition, she was attracted to men and says, rather quickly, “sexually, I was heterosexual. Was that a high priority – in what the public perceived to be this male, Olympic stud? Not even close.”
I mention all this because for the second half of our interview, it feels to me as if I’m interacting with an ego that, to use the language Jenner herself eschews, has been thoroughly socialised as male, to the extent that – and I apologise for this – after the interview, I inadvertently refer to her with the male pronoun, having to that point, and as is correct, referred to her exclusively as “she”. This does not undermine her journey, or the journey of any other trans person. But after hanging out with Jenner, it is impossible to avoid the sense that she is still deeply vested in the spoils that came to her as a result of the outward signifiers of her pretransition life.
Anyway, she says, she is not interested in sex. “I’m more excited about fighting battles for our community than I am about going out on a date.” Poor old community. It’s impossible to tell if Jenner does more harm than good, but if we are all, at this point, permitted to be the sole determinants of our own identities, then Jenner has the right to define herself precisely as she pleases. “It was hard giving old Bruce up, in a lot of ways,” she says. “He still lives inside me. I still do a lot of the things old Bruce used to do. I still fly airplanes and go race cars once in a while. I can have the best of both worlds.” She bestows on me her most dazzling smile. “I can live my life authentically, and still do all the fun stuff!”
The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Hak Song had worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before he was held on Saturday.
“A relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes,” the KCNA said.
Kim Sang Duk was arrested at the Pyongyang International Airport on 22 April, the KCNA said. It said he was “intercepted for committing criminal acts” to overthrow the North’s government, but didn’t elaborate.
On Sunday, the KCNA did not say whether the two cases were connected.
In Washington, the state department said it was aware of the report of the new detention and that “the security of US citizens is one of the department’s highest priorities”.
Kim Hak Song and Kim Sang Duk are among at least four Americans being detained in North Korea, as tensions between the two countries continue.
The others are Otto Warmbier, who is serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor for alleged anti-state acts, and Kim Dong Chul, serving a 10-year term with hard labor for alleged espionage.
Washington, Seoul and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, which in recent years have involved high-profile American missions sent to secure releases.
When an American citizen is reported detained, the US works with the Swedish embassy in the North Korean capital, since the US and the North do not have diplomatic relations.
The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is the only privately funded university in North Korea and is unique for having a large number of foreign staff.
But these new ambulances, equipped with sirens and a doctor on board, will exclusively serve injured cows, in the latest of a series of high-profile schemes to improve the wellbeing of the animals, which are revered by most Hindus.
He said the ambulance service had received about 200 calls and was able to attend to about 25 cows a day.
For the past 20 years the trust has been running a similar low-cost ambulance service for rickshaw pullers and rural labourers, and it added cow welfare to its agenda in the past two years.
Sanjay Rai,chief trustee, said he had been interested in helping to protect cows for nearly a decade but had lacked financial resources to establish an ambulance service. “And there was no support from the government side,” he said.
The new state administration of Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu revivalist, has been more encouraging and had allocated the ambulance service a toll-free number, he said. “On a verbal basis they support us, but for financial support they have not started anything yet,” Rai said.
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, won office in 2014 campaigning for a national ban on cow slaughter, and under his tenure there has been a surge in projects to improve the animal’s welfare.
The other side of the growing zeal to protect cows is increasing violence against those perceived to be harming them. In Rajasthan last month a dairy farmer, Pehlu Khan, was attacked by a mob and died from his injuries after being caught transporting cattle.
Movements to protect the cow first became prominent in India in the late 19th century, accompanying a growing political consciousness among Hindus. The issue has frequently been a trigger for tension with India’s sizeable Muslim minority, and has become increasingly charged since Modi’s election in 2014.
Most Hindus eschew beef, but the meat is consumed by some in the country’s south, by many of India’s religious minorities, and by traditionally poorer castes who regard the animal as a cheap source of protein.
Critics of Modi and the broader Hindu nationalist movement argue the threat to cows is overblown and that the animal’s welfare is being used to whip up anti-Islamic sentiment among the Hindu majority.
The finer details of the cash offer still needed to be ironed out and approved by the local council, Galliano wrote on his Facebook page. But if all goes ahead, from next year anyone who transfers their residence to Bormida and either rents or buys a property there will be gifted €2,000.
“We’re still working out the plan, but anyone is welcome to come and live here,” said a local councillor, who asked not to be named. “We’re a small community but very welcoming. We’re high up in a mountain area but also not far from the sea – it’s a healthy lifestyle, the air is very clean.”
But what is life like in Bormida? The manager of Oddone Giuseppe, one of the town’s four restaurants, said: “There is nothing much to do here. But life is so simple and natural, we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food. Life would definitely be free of stress.”
A report last year by Legambiente, an Italian environmental association, found that 2,500 villages across the country risked being abandoned owing to depopulation.
In January the culture ministry named 2017 the “year of the village” as part of an attempt to promote tourism in places at risk of becoming deserted.
But Berisha’s brilliance – and James Troisi’s extra-time volley that struck a post – could not prevent Sydney’s third A-League title, secured in a mostly jubilant, but uniformly breathless, arena that had witnessed fireworks – both metaphorical and literal – from start to finish. It also went some way to eliminate painful memories of the last time these two sides met in a grand final, two years ago in Melbourne, although Graham Arnold would rather have won in different circumstances.
“I’ve been through that [a grand final penalty shootout] before,” the Sydney coach said. “It’s not the greatest way to win or lose. But that’s the way it is. I thought it was a real cup final. It was a very physical game, a lot of free-kicks, a lot of fouls, a lot of passion.”
Indeed, it was far from a classic encounter between these two old rivals but what it lacked in class and guile was made up for in brawn and, by the end of the night, pure drama. From the first whistle, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque set the tone, leaving a high foot in on eventual Joe Marston medal recipient Daniel Georgievski’s thigh and what ensued during a niggly, and at times spiteful, game should have come as no surprise.
Referee Jarred Gillett had his work cut out – nearly every decision he made was vociferously contested by one side or the other, and the opening period ended with five names in his notebook. He had accrued a total of 11 by the time the shootout arrived. Meanwhile, Graham Arnold and Kevin Muscat spent much of their time stalking the touchline and berating the fourth official.
The flow of the game suffered from the regular stoppages, playacting and constant recriminations – and arguably the state of the pitch, which had been used for a Super Rugby fixture the previous night despite a last-ditch attempt to shift that fixture elsewhere. With both team’s more creative players stifled, the likes of Ninković and Rojas were unable to stamp their authority in the way they might have been expected.
With supply lines cut, scoring opportunities were few and far between. Fahid Ben Khalfallah found Rojas at the back post with pinpoint accuracy after 11 minutes, but the New Zealand international’s pull back across the face of goal was turned over the bar by a Sydney defender.
Ninković was able, fleetingly, to give a glimpse of what he is capable of when he delivered a teasing ball across the face of goal on 16 minutes, the kind that must have been in mind when the term “corridor of uncertainty” was invented. Victory survived, but it led to a brief period when Sydney began to flex their muscles for the first time.
Berisha soon put paid to that with his individual moment of brilliance. The Kosovo international took on the Sydney defence with the kind of single-minded intent that has become his trademark. The way he scythed through Sydney’s backline showed scant regard for a defence that had, to that point, conceded just 12 goals all season. He has now scored in each of the four grand finals he has appeared in.
The initial spate of bookings came soon after the deadlock had been broken and it took just over 20 minutes for Khalfallah and James Troisi to been shown yellow, along with Sydney’s Josh Brillante, Ninković and Filip Hološko. Three of those names were taken following an ugly 20-man coming together in the centre circle as tempers boiled over in a moment that typified the first half.
Any hopes that cooler heads would emerge after the break soon evaporated as Victory skipper Carl Valeri levelled the booking ledger by becoming Victory’s third man into the book, for a crude challenge that might have warranted a straight red on another day.
Football was, however, occasionally allowed to shine through amid the pervading fug. Most of it came from Sydney in the second half and it was the home side who fashioned the better chances – first Hološko ballooned over from close range when he should really have done better, and then David Carney, on for Hološko, saw an effort saved by Thomas.
Carney, who won the title 11 years ago during his first stint with Sydney, was to play a key role moments later. It was his curling shot that Lawrence Thomas tipped onto the inside of the post, leaving a desperate, prone Berisha to head feebly into the path of the onrushing Grant. The right-back tapped gleefully home.
The goal further invigorated Sydney, yet try as they might and amid much huffing and puffing they were unable to blow down Victory’s door again in regulation time. Indeed, they could have been caught on the break, as Rojas and Troisi combined well, but the latter lacked a finishing touch.
“The first half was difficult,” Arnold said. “The first half we didn’t play our way, we ended up playing a game of kick and rush and fighting for the second ball. And when you have the quality of players like Ninković and Brosque that’s not their type of game.
“I said at half-time I’d rather lose than not play our way, the way we’ve played all season, the way we’ve created history with a lot of things. I wanted us to play our way and we did.”
To extra-time and Victory pulses again quickened, momentarily, when a high ball was launched into the box before it skewed away from a posse of players and brushed the outside of the post; the flag was up, regardless.
After the changeover, and with tired limbs in evidence all over the pitch, Troisi dug deep and mustered what so nearly could have been the defining moment of the game – a truly brilliant volley that arguably deserved to be the winner, but he saw it cannon back off Vukovic’s upright.
At the other end, Carney had a chance to settle it with five minutes remaining but he sliced his shot horribly to leave the expectant home crowd frustrated – and preparing to accept that their entire season, which had been so dominant, would not only come down to a winner-takes-all match, but rather one decisive penalty shootout. This time for Sydney, they will feel justice was served.
Cleaning up all that was straightforward: turn the machine down to 30C and use an eco detergent.
In terms of plastic fibre volume, a city the size of Berlin may be responsible for releasing the equivalent of 540,000 plastic bags’ worth of them into the ocean daily.
That sounds overwhelming, but the more natural fibres you wear (such as cotton), the better. Frequently washed items should be non-synthetic where possible.
With the rise of the clean beauty movement it can be difficult navigating the plethora of products out there that claim to be natural and organic.
Green People, celebrating 20 years in the business, is the real deal. This is the brand that defined what it means to be organic.
Back in 1999, founder Charlotte Vøhtz, was invited to be on a committee for the Soil Association (the UK body with the most stringent organic certification) to design the first standards for organic beauty.
Vøhtz’s drive to create her truly organic skincare range began when her young daughter Sandra was battling multiple skin allergies and eczema. Now her brand offers 160 sustainable skin and hair products (including two special anniversary ranges), but nothing that has been diluted or bulked out with high levels of water, drying alcohol or synthetic fillers.
Cook said that there had been a “pause in purchases” due to “earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones”.
Apple reported iPhone sales of 50.8m in the first three months of 2017, down by 1% year-on-year. Its revenues grew 5% to $52.9bn, which was just below analysts’ forecasts of $53.1bn.
The company’s financial performance is heavily reliant on the iPhone. While it generated more than $33bn of sales in the quarter, a category it defines as “other products”, which includes the iPod, Apple TV and the Apple Watch, generated just $2.9bn.
While the Apple Watch may be popular with those who use it, it has certainly not created a new platform of customers for the company to meaningfully develop – not yet, anyway.
Reports in the technology industry suggest that the next iPhone will be a significant step forward. According to rumours, it could include wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. But even so, an upgrade to an existing product is unlikely to be a game-changer in the same way that the original iPhone was a decade ago, or the iPod and the iPad were.
It would be foolhardy to call this the peak for Apple, because you can never be sure what mystery products are lurking in its research and development buildings. However, it is clearly becoming more difficult for Apple, Samsung and others to expand the smartphone sector. The devices are now effectively a commodity, particularly in the western world. The market is for customers looking to upgrade every couple of years rather than those looking to buy their first handset.
But a slowdown in its biggest market makes the $250bn cash mountain that Apple is still sitting on even more intriguing.
Analysts at Citigroup, the investment bank, have drawn up a list of seven companies that Apple could buy with the cash. Their candidates are Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla, streaming service Hulu, and video game makers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive.
Some of these deals, such as Disney or the videogame makers, would basically be bolt-ons that would allow Apple to share the success these businesses already enjoy.
Buying Tesla, however, could be transformative and help Apple down the path towards transferring its technology to driverless and electric vehicles. Rumours suggest that Apple may already be working on an electric vehicle anyway.
Even if Apple does not do a deal, it seems its next move will be about bringing its technology closer to our everyday lives, whether through a car or turning its headphones into health monitors, another rumoured plan.
As smartphone sales slow, we are closer than ever to finding out what Apple’s next move will be.
It is true that the last of the five profits warnings in the past four years arrived a few weeks after the end of Pearson’s financial year, but it was a humdinger of a warning. It signalled a cut in the dividend this year, thereby removing the sole source of solace for investors during Fallon’s ill-starred reign. The share price, even after the bounce that accompanied the unveiling of yet another restructuring plan, has halved in little more than two years.
Fallon is correct that the remuneration committee sets his pay. Thus Elizabeth Corley, chair of that committee, and Sidney Taurel, group chairman, must take direct blame for a fiasco that saw almost two-thirds of voting shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Almost a third also opposed Pearson’s forward-looking pay policy. That level of opposition is extremely rare at FTSE 100 companies.
Corley also received a 27% vote against her re-election. She is the former chief executive of giant investment manager Allianz Global Investors, so this was a case of shareholding fund managers voting against one of their own. She should take the hint and go. Pearson’s commitment to “continuing dialogue with our shareholders” on pay will look thin if the same individual is sent out to bat again.
“We’re the world’s learning company,” says the corporate blurb, but Pearson has shown zero understanding of the public anger over undeserved corporate pay. The lesson isn’t hard: when you’ve reported record losses, don’t give the boss a bonus.
Oil industry hopes that the price of Brent crude would stabilise at around $60 (£46) a barrel were dashed last week.
But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week.
For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.
Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.

“The accident happened when the bus was descending on a steep hill in rainy conditions,” regional commander Charles Mkumbo said. “We are still investigating the incident to determine if it was caused by a mechanical defect or human error on the part of the driver.”
The pupils killed in the accident, which occurred at about 9.30am in Karatu district, were aged 12 to 13, and from the Lucky Vincent primary school on their way to visit another school, Mkumbo said.
Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, described the accident as a national tragedy in a statement.
Mrs May is not the most awesome political genius to walk the earth. Far from it. She has little in the way of solid achievement to show for her nine months at Number 10 and has spent her election campaign swaddled in opacity about what she would do with a five-year term. Mrs May only gets to look unbeatable because of the paucity of the competition provided by a Labour leadership that combines unelectable hard leftism with utter ineptness.
It was not “inevitable” that we would have this “Brexit election” at all. This is happening because of the narrow victory for Out in the referendum last year. Only a small amount of mental energy is required to envisage an alternative history that would have produced a different result. A Labour party under more credible leadership that had demonstrated some enthusiasm for the Remain cause could very well have tipped the result the other way when the country made its choice about Europe.
As Labour stares into the jaws of disaster, it is essential to grasp that there was nothing pre-ordained about this rout. The electoral evisceration of Labour wasn’t written in the stars. Defeat is not to be blamed on the whims of the gods or the tides of the moon. This calamity can’t be put down to the caprice of fate. The Tories were handed this opportunity to smash their way to a big majority because Labour made terrible choices and is under abysmal leadership.
A thumping Tory triumph now looks unstoppable. It was never inevitable.
Pizzas, like Chrises, Lesleys or Sams, mostly come in two types. The first type – let’s call it Category A – is the sort you can make very easily from scratch in a regular oven, buy frozen, or order from a standard high-street takeaway. The really important thing about Category A pizzas is the cheese. Provided the cheese has melted and there’s plenty of it, you can hide all manner of sins.
What we feared most of all on our side of the counter was people asking for refunds because the food had been “cooked wrong”. The difficult truth was that no cooking of any kind could have improved the food we sold. The best bet in the whole park was the pizza parlour, which gloried under a comically racist name like Greasy Silvio’s or Flirty Paulo’s Pizza Place. Not because the pizza was any better than anything else, you understand, but because if you slather enough cheese even on the cheapest, most overpriced topping, most people will eat it.
That’s Category A. Then there’s Category B, which you can make at home provided you have a pizza oven and a great deal of patience. The art of a good Category B pizza is mainly in the base – a thin disc of dough, and proper tomato.
What both categories have in common is that, provided you get the essential element right, people will forgive an awful lot. Your Category As can survive the grittiest of pepperoni, the lousiest olives, or pineapple of any kind or quantity, provided they’re laden with melted cheese. Your Category Bs can weather the most pretentious of artichokes, the most obscure mushrooms, the faddiest truffles, as long as the base is crisp and the tomatoes fresh.
And just as there is no greater horror that realising that Chris, Lesley and Sam are all men, there is nothing quite as disappointing as getting a Category A pizza when you want a Category B, or vice-versa for that matter.
Because although a lot of food writing presents Category A pizzas as something you graduate from when you discover Category B and better things – a bit like going to school, but with more grease and less trauma – the truth is that both types of pizza have a time and a place.
Category A pizzas aren’t just the stuff that high-margin, low-quality chains make their money with. They’re also the food that provides plenty of social grease along with the actual grease: at cinemas, while playing cards, Fifa, Cluedo, watching boxsets or Eurovision. There’s an awful lot of emotion in the average bite of a Category A pizza. There’s not a lot of emotional resonance in a trendy sourdough pizza. Unless you are Italian, or loaded, a thin crust and fresh tomatoes will not remind you of your teenage years. A soggy middle, coagulated cheese and dubiously sourced ham will.
Do they kiss their mommas with those mouths? When interviewed, marchers said that Trump was an “embarrassment” and “unwelcome”. In the end, Trump completed his official engagement and veered back to his New Jersey golf course without even popping in to Trump Tower to see if he could find which cupboard Melania had frantically hidden in this time.
What’s the betting that Trump was sitting in the back of his car pulling his maddest, crossest presidential face – you know, the one that makes him resemble Mount Rushmore before the stonemasons started work?
Only recently, Trump was hinting that being the leader of the free world wasn’t all it was cracked up to be and now this happens.
The people of New York need to take a long hard look at themselves. Anyone would think that the only way that they’d want Trump to take another bite of the Big Apple would be if he instantly choked on it and they got to watch.
This month sees the 20th anniversary of the granting by New Labour of independence to the Bank of England.
It was not full-scale independence but “operational independence” in monetary policy: that is, the freedom to change interest rates without having to consult the chancellor. The Bank is still the Treasury’s agent in other matters, such as decisions about the nation’s currency reserves.
The Strand Group at King’s College London held a high-powered conference to mark Bank independence last week: but against the background of elections and all this Brexit nonsense, the anniversary of what was a controversial event at the time seems to have passed non-aficionados by.
I myself was against the move at the time, and while hardly anyone questions the idea now, I am still inclined to take the Zhou Enlai view. This is a reference to then Chinese premier’s reply in the 1970s when he was asked what he thought the consequences of the French Revolution had been. He famously replied: “Too early to tell.” This has gone down in fake history as a witty reference to the events of 1789, but an official who was present said Zhou was actually referring to the riots in Paris in 1968.
Even critics of Gordon Brown give him, and his economic adviser at the time, Ed Balls, credit for making the Bank independent in this area.
It is noteworthy, however, that most of the Brexiters who go on about parliamentary sovereignty seem to have no qualms about placing decisions in the hands of unelected officials.
The granting of independence was the final resort of British policymakers in the long, and losing, battle for Labour and Tories alike to control inflation. Both parties had problems with incomes policies in the 1970s. The Tories brought monetarism from 1979, but that failed – indeed, the doctrine was even subsequently disowned by Milton Friedman, its most prominent advocate. Then came Chancellor Lawson’s obsession with the success of the Germans in controlling inflation; his instrument was to be membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. When Margaret Thatcher vetoed that, Lawson directed the Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market so that the pound “shadowed” the Deutschmark.
When he was rumbled, there was hell to pay, ending with Lawson’s dramatic resignation in 1989. Ironically, after Lawson went, Thatcher was finally worn down a year later, and the pound joined the ERM in 1990.
Membership of the ERM then ended in sterling’s ignominious exit from the mechanism on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. Amazingly, the British establishment did not seem to be aware of what the Germans knew only too well: namely that the historic reunification of Germany at around the time we joined the ERM would have serious inflationary consequences, because of the massive cost of absorbing the run-down East German economy. It was exactly the wrong time to subject Britain to what was effectively German monetary policy.
John Major was prime minister, and he took the rap. Now, although some fanatics had been trying to reverse the result of the 1975 referendum (a two-to-one verdict in favour of remaining in the EEC we had joined in 1973) from the start, we can really date the onset of the cancerous growth of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party to the early 1990s. The general election of 1992 saw the end of the dominance of pro-Europeans in the parliamentary party and the rise of what the beleaguered Major termed the Eurosceptic “bastards”.
Meanwhile, after the ERM, the next supposed panacea for British inflation was central bank independence. While this period has coincided with low inflation, it has not necessarily caused it. Most industrial countries have had low inflation in recent times.
However, central bank independence is but a sideshow when it comes to the major economic crisis of our times, which is the prospect of Brexit.
Well, it is an open question whether the poison has been neutralised. Quite apart from that, we are in the lamentable position where a Tory party that used to have the national interest at heart is now sacrificing everything to its own preservation. Yes: thanks to Theresa May’s lame acceptance of the result of a referendum conducted on a false prospectus, the poison has now spread to the nation at large.
We have a government that really is, in Angela Merkel’s word, “delusional” about squaring the circle: obsessed by the immigration she failed to control at the Home Office, May wishes to leave the customs union and the single market while cherrypicking her way back into the best bits. This is impossible. As often happens, the people running this country do not seem to realise that our continental partners have their own interests, and tend to say what they mean.
It is not too late to rethink. My old friend Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, says that it is not irrevocable. It is reversible. There is still an opportunity for our leaders to see sense, and own up to the people.
I know the people have spoken. They spoke in 1945 and said one thing, and in 1951 and said another. Throughout the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, they said one thing, and then another. To coin a phrase: it is a people’s privilege to change its mind.
The three-time Olympian, three-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champion was 37.
“The only reason why the USA is in any conversation in the sport of bobsled is because of Steve Holcomb,” said US bobsled pilot Nick Cunningham, who roomed next to Holcomb in Lake Placid. “He was the face of our team. He was the face of our sport. We all emulated him. Every driver in the world watched him, because he was that good at what he did. It’s a huge loss, huge loss, not just for our team but for the entire bobsled community.”
No cause of death was immediately announced, but officials said there were no indications of foul play after the preliminary parts of an ongoing investigation were completed. USA Bobsled and Skeleton said it was believed Holcomb died in his sleep.
An autopsy was scheduled for Sunday. Funeral arrangements are expected to be finalized in the coming days.
“USA Bobsled and Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend,” federation CEO Darrin Steele said.
Holcomb was a native of Park City, Utah, and his signature moment came at the 2010 Vancouver games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold medal drought for the US in bobsled’s signature race.
“The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb,” US Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said. “Steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, and his perseverance and achievements were an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve’s family and the entire bobsledding community.”
Holcomb was still one of the world’s elite drivers, finishing second on the World Cup circuit in two-man points and third in four-man points this past season.
The final victory of his career was last December in Lake Placid. He won 60 World Cup medals in his career, 10 more at the world championships and three in the Olympics, making him one of the most decorated pilots in the world.
“You will be loved, missed and remembered forever,” US women’s pilot Jamie Greubel Poser wrote on Twitter.
Holcomb was an Eagle Scout and served as both a member of the Utah Army National Guard and the Army World Class Athlete Program. He was cherubic, almost always happy in public, someone whose sense of humor was well-known throughout the close-knit bobsled world. Teammates even spent a season chronicling his “Holcy Dance,” a little less-than-rhythmic shuffle that he would do at each stop on the World Cup circuit to make fellow sliders laugh.
But there was also a troubled side, including battles with depression and alcohol, plus a failed hotel-room suicide attempt involving sleeping pills in 2007 which he wrote about in his autobiography, But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold.
“After going through all that and still being here, I realized what my purpose was,” Holcomb said in a 2014 interview.
Winning gold with push athletes Steve Mesler, Curt Tomasevicz and Justin Olsen at the Vancouver Olympics turned Holcomb into a full-fledged star. In the months that followed, Holcomb met President Barack Obama, played golf with Charles Barkley, hung out with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Cleveland Indians game and went to the Indianapolis 500.
In the bobsled world, he was larger than life. “We’re all still in shock,” Cunningham said. “I don’t know if mourning will happen for a long time, because the shock part will take a while.”
The mandate of the outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, officially ends at midnight on Sunday 14 May and he is expected to vacate the Élysée earlier that day.
On Monday 8 May, the interior minister, Matthias Fekl, will officially announce the result of the presidential election. The first results, which came in at 8pm French time (7pm BST) on Sunday evening, are only estimations based on the initial count from several hundred polling stations that closed an hour before.
The handover of power takes place next weekend. The ceremony follows a well-rehearsed form: Macron will go to the Elysée and be received in the courtyard by Hollande. After a brief chat, Hollande will leave the presidential palace accompanied by the Republican Guard.
 Macron’s first engagement as president will be to pay tribute at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior at the Arc de Triomphe and visit Paris city hall.
Of those to be recruited to his government, Macron said: “I will choose them for their experience, their competence, what they have done and not for what they represent or their political weight ...
“They will be people who are important mayors, regional or general council presidents; people who have sometimes been ministers, but who do things and who will be able to run an administration and conduct a public policy.”
For other ministries, he is expected to fish from the Socialist and centre-right Les Républicains pools, luring experienced and respected politicians such as the former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s labour minister Xavier Bertrand from the right and the Lyon mayor, Gérard Collomb, from the left.
Christine Lagarde, the current IMF managing director, has also been mentioned.
“This is my first season and I found a lot of situations, a lot of players. Pochettino has been working there for three years and has changed a lot of players, and is working very well. For me Tottenham are a really strong team and it’s normal to see them fighting for the title.
“But if you consider the squads, the numbers in each squad, you can see the difference: one team prepared to play the Champions League with 25 or 26 players, and another prepared to play only the league, the FA Cup and the League Cup. My expectation was a great challenge in this league against Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool. Next season for us it will be the same. But we have one year to work and then the possibility to go into the market and choose the right players on my idea of football.”
The prospect of Conte adding an entirely new spine to the side is very real. “We are building,” he added. “We started to build this season. If we are able to win, it’s a great achievement for us. When you start to build, it’s very difficult to carry on winning. This is a process. No one thought Chelsea could fight to win the title and be in the FA Cup final this season.
“For sure, we are in a moment of transition. We are losing a lot of top players who have written the story, the history, of this club. This season we lost Branislav Ivanovic, we lost Mikel John Obi and next season we’ll have lost John [Terry]: three big players. Don’t forget Oscar, who went in the transfer market when we sold him.
“But don’t forget we are building to try and create a good foundation to support not only for the next season, but for many years, and to make sure Chelsea stay always in and fight for the Champions League. To try and win the Champions League and the title.”
The go-ahead for the nation state bill by the ministerial committee for legislation means it will now move forward to a vote by the country’s parliament. The bill has to pass several stages in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for it to become law and could also be challenged in the courts.
Critics say the law is discriminatory and could undermine Israel’s balance of being both a Jewish and democratic state by harming the rights of minorities.
Hebrew and Arabic are both Israel’s national languages, but the bill states that Hebrew would be the lone national language, downgrading Arabic to “a special status in the state” whose “speakers have the right to language-accessible state services”.
The legislation is designed to be enshrined in Israel’s basic law, regarded as the closest approximation in Israel to a constitution.
The timing of the bill – after four years of deliberations – is significant, coming two weeks before a planned visit by Donald Trump in which the US president had hoped to breath life into a moribund peace process.
Although the bill has undergone some changes in the drafting process – not least removing language that would have seen Israel’s democracy subordinated in importance to its Jewish identity – it remains highly contentious.
While the way Israel’s legislative process functions has long allowed parties and individuals to put forward legislation likely to be challenged by the courts, the latest proposed law comes in the context of Israel’s most rightwing ever government.
The committee approved the bill unanimously but the measure has been condemned by opposition politicians, academics and in some parts of the Israeli media.
Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, representing Arab-Israeli parties, said the bill was a “declaration of war” on Israel’s Arab citizens. “Discrimination has received a legal stamp. The danger in this law in that it establishes two classes of citizen – Jewish and Arab,” he said.
Erel Margalit, a contender for the leadership of the centrist Zionist Union party, called the bill “reminiscent of dark periods” in history.
Zehava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, said the bill’s intention was to downgrade the rights of non-Jews in Israel. “The result of the Jewish state bill is clear. Jews will get preference over all other citizens, clearly violating human rights, democracy and the rights of the Arab minority in Israel,” she said.
The bill’s sponsor, Avi Dichter, an MP from Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, defended the proposals, as did other ministers.
 ”This is a small step for the Jewish state bill, which establishes that Israel is and will be a Jewish and democratic state, and it’s a big step towards defining our identity, not only in the eyes of the world but primarily for ourselves, Israelis – to be a free people in our land,” said Dichter after the committee’s vote.
He said the bill was necessary because “events of recent months prove that this is a battle for Israel’s image and national identity. The Palestinians no longer hide their goal of erasing the Jewish people’s nation state”.
The legislative committee’s chairman, Yariv Levin, also a Likud MP, said he had decided to put an end to foot-dragging over the bill. “We’ve been waiting to discuss and make a decision on this legislation for too long. This is a basic law, which has the simple objective of safeguarding Israel’s status as the nation state of the Jewish people. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been made into law so far,” he said.

They said that growing investor demand for riskier assets meant the bullion price may not go up soon, but demand for risk hedging remained, so any downside would be limited.
On April 25, spot gold was down 0.2 percent to $1,272.67 per ounce and US gold futures dropped 0.3 percent to $1,274.2.
The bullion price fell to $1,265.9 last Tuesday, the lowest it's been since April 11, as the first round of France's presidential election result showed that there was less support for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
That reduced concerns that she would win the election and France would potentially exit the European Union.
After US President Trump unveiled tax policies last week, gold came under short term pressure on growing potential for an interest rates rise, according to a research note from Goldman Sachs.
"Potential interest hikes may put further pressure on the gold price and cause great volatility in the short term," said a research note from Bosera Fund.
"Unveiling of global economic data, particularly US GDP, is also likely to cause volatility. For investors who would like to time the market, it is time for reducing their holdings and banking gains."
Uncertainties abounded in Europe, as several countries were due to hold general elections and in the wake of the UK vote, as well as the arket response to US tax policies and healthcare reforms. These were expected to support the gold price in the next few months, said Cheng Anhua, analyst at Zhonghe Xinfu Precious Metal Investment.
"Volatility will be a key word for the gold price in the next few months, as there are so many 'boots' to drop, or not to drop," Cheng said.
"But even if gold price continues to retreat, the loss will not last long or be significant because the market is too eventful for continuous losses for the safe-haven asset."
In the longer term, analysts said gold still deserved a position in investment portfolios as demand for risk hedging was expected to increase if geopolitical concerns grew.
For investors in China, analysts said the currency exchange rate between Chinese yuan and US dollar needed to be taken into consideration.
If an investment is dollar-denominated, a comparison of dollar-gold trend and yuan-dollar trend is needed to decide wether the gold is getting more expensive or not, said Yang Fei, analyst with Shanghai-based Seawonder Precious Metal Investment.
Li Xunlei, chief economist with Zhongtai Securities, said in a forum in Shanghai last week that gold gained more than US real estate did in the past 16 years, showing that the safe haven asset was a good for long-term investment.
The gold price rose from $300 per ounce in 2000 to $1,200 per ounce by the end of 2016, enjoying about 300 percent growth, while US properties gained 75 percent, Li added.

MADRID — Maria Sharapova is not yet worried about whether she will be awarded a wild card for Wimbledon following her doping ban.
After moving into the second round of the Madrid Open on Sunday, Sharapova said it's too early to think about the July tournament.
"I mean, look, I would love to be in a position to compete in that event," she said.
"It's very meaningful to me. But it's just too far down the line right now."Sharapova defeated Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Croatia in three sets for her fourth victory since serving a 15-month ban for testing positive for meldonium at last year's Australian Open. She was eliminated in the semifinals in Stuttgart last month in her first tournament since the ban.
"I feel like I'm like a broken-record player, but these tournaments are really important," Sharapova said. "The match play that I have, getting myself in these situations, getting out of them, will ultimately help me for those big events whether I'm in there or not."Sharapova, who is also expected to play in Rome later this month, has been playing on wild-card entries because she lost her ranking following the doping suspension.
The decision on her wild card for Wimbledon may not come until June 20, according to tournament officials. The five-time Grand Slam champion and former top-ranked player will know on May 16 if she will be able to compete on a wild card in the French Open, which starts May 22.
A win in the second round in Madrid against Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, one of the most outspoken players against Sharapova's return to tennis, could be enough to let the Russian qualify for Wimbledon on points, without needing a wild card.
Bouchard, who called Sharapova "a cheater" and said she should be banned for life from tennis, was a finalist in Wimbledon in 2014. Sharapova won the 2004 title in Wimbledon.
Sharapova said playing as many matches as possible is the most important thing for her at the moment.
"I feel like it's still a learning experience, and it's still just getting back in the groove and understanding what I need to work on and improve," she said. "But those are all things that are normal and are part of the process, part of kind of the journey that I've started.
"You can train for as much as you want, but playing the matches and being in that competitive environment is just not the same. You can never replicate it," she said.
"Expectations of how I play, I'll get back into that. But, as I said, the match play is the most important thing right now."Sharapova said she is not being affected by the off-the-court controversy involving her return to tennis.
"I'm very much in my element. I think it's always great to be the person that's kind of in control of your actions while everything around you is moving in a different way," she said. "Not much has changed from my end. I still go through my routines. I still go through my training. I'm around my team. But then there's a little bit more around. I definitely feel it, but it doesn't change anything that I do.
"I'm kind of the driver of that," she said. "I like being in that position. I like doing my work. I love being quiet about it and letting everyone around speak or have the noise, whatever it is."

Mainland authorities call for thorough probe, ask that fishermen be respected
Mainland authorities called on Taiwan to thoroughly investigate the shooting of fishermen by the Taiwan coast guard over the weekend, to avoid similar incidents in the future.
A fishing boat from Guangdong province was seized on Saturday morning by a Taiwan patrol boat in waters near Penghu county in southeastern Taiwan.
Two of its seven crew members were injured by rubber bullets fired from the patrol boat, Taiwan authorities said. They were sent to a hospital in Penghu for medical treatment, while the other five were detained.
An Fengshan, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, called on the Taiwan side late on Saturday to respect the fact that fishermen from both sides of the Taiwan Straits have long been fishing in the area.
"Similar cases in which Taiwan has seized a mainland fishing boat have occurred frequently in recent times," An said. "We have highlighted respect for the rights of mainland fishermen several times, but another incident occurred on Saturday morning."
Taiwan should stop seizing fishing boats without sound reason for doing so, he said.
"We requested the Taiwan side take the case seriously, release the fishermen and the boat as soon as possible and prevent the recurrence of similar cases in the future."
In March, another spokesman from the office, Ma Xiaoguang, commented on reports that Taiwan authorities had detained 20 mainland fishermen and their boat on charges of illegally trespassing in waters around the Dongsha Islands.
At that time, the office said: "Taiwan should respect fishermen from both sides of the Straits, including those from Hong Kong and Macao, stop its improper treatment of fishermen and protect their lives and property."
Ma voiced opposition to acts that undermine the basis of cross-Straits talks and hinder the development of cross-Straits ties.
The mainland has offered travel conveniences to Taiwan residents for several years.
At the end of 2016, the Civil Aviation Administration of China started upgrading self-service systems at mainland airports, in a move to make buying tickets and checking-in easier for Taiwan travelers.
More than 1,700 self-service facilities are planned across the country by the end of this year, the administration said.

Now, let's take a look at the main characters in the film.
In June 2013, a young American postgraduate called Sophie was passing through London when she called up the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.
“That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.”
Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”
Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”
On that day in June 2013, Sophie met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she suggested he meet this firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.”
Who’s her father?
“Eric Schmidt.”
Eric Schmidt – the chairman of Google?
“Yes. And she suggested Alexander should meet this company called Palantir.”
I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of eBay and PayPal, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump.
In some ways, Eric Schmidt’s daughter showing up to make an introduction to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.
It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.
There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.
Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign.
What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.
It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”.
How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.”
AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished.
There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.
Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.”
He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said.
Who’s Chris Wylie?
“He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.”
There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.”
I did find Chris Wylie. He refused to comment.
Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”.
I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.
What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.
SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.
This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”
Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.
And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.
Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.
The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.”
Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.
But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?
“It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.”
Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.
“We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.”
A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform.
David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.”
These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”.
In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?
It makes me think again about the story involving Sophie Schmidt, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.
Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.
A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.
“On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.”
In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.
The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.
Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.
The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”.
On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook.
Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”.
And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.”
The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.
But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”.
And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer.
This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.”
Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.”
Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.
“He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.”
On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.
I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.
“I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.”
It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.
And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.
For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.
Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America.
Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.”
This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn’t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics. It’s about the first step into a brave, new, increasingly undemocratic world.

It is possible that the victims knew their assailant, as the condominium had tight security and there was a “message of retribution” written on a wall of the apartment, the Boston Globe reported.
Bolanos, 38, was a pediatric anesthesiologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, according to its website, and an instructor at Harvard Medical School. Field, 49, also an anesthesiologist, worked at North Shore Pain Management.
Police had gone to the building on a report of a man with a gun. Police commissioner William Evans said the suspect opened fire when officers confronted him at the door. He said police fired back and hit the man several times.
After the shootings, the suspect was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The officers were not hurt.
Authorities expect to file multiple charges against 30-year-old Bampumim Teixeira, of Chelsea. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday. The Suffolk county district attorney’s office said Teixeira has a pair of larceny convictions on his record. In June of last year, Teixeira passed a note demanding money at a Boston bank. He committed the same crime two years earlier.
The office did not know on Sunday if he had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk district attorney Daniel Conley, said he did not know what charges Teixeira would face, but Evans told local media that two murder charges were likely.
On its Facebook page, North Shore Pain Management called Field “instrumental in the creation of this practice” and that his death “leaves an inescapable void in all of us”.
Bolanos’ godfather, Michael Gibbs, told The Boston Globe that she and Field were “good, kind, gentle people”.
“Hopefully, this guy that they caught will be able to say who he is and why this was done,” Gibbs said. “That’s all we’re hoping, is to get some kind of information. Why did this happen?”
On behalf of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, chief executive John Fernandez expressed sadness over the deaths of both doctors.
“The entire Mass. Eye and Ear community is deeply saddened by the deaths of Dr. Lina Bolanos and her fiance,” he said on the practice’s website. “Dr Bolanos was an outstanding pediatric anesthesiologist and a wonderful colleague in the prime of both her career and life.”

Designer and artist James Jacob dreams of a quiet revolution; he sees the considerate design of everyday objects as a medium to change the world. “I’m most inspired by a poetic, purposeful form of design,” he says. Since graduating from Kingston University, where he studied product and furniture design, Jacob has worked on individual concept art and collaborative furniture-making briefs. He is also involved in the Baum Studio project, a new initiative to create affordable oak tables “made to last 100 years”.
In the toilet area, Geberit’s Monolith + AquaClean Sela is well suited to his overall design: “The toilet is allowed to hold its own, relaxed space. A toilet is an ordinary object, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be beautiful.”
 Some great design double acts are just meant to happen. Such was the case for Issy Spence and Oliver Jack, who met while working together on the University of Bath’s flagship Basil Spence project, a final-year challenge exploring students’ knowledge of civil engineering and architecture.
Geberit’s AquaClean Mera is positioned between the sink and shower. “The design of the toilet lends itself really well to that space,” says Jack. “Sitting next to the white subway tiles, it becomes an elegant, integrated part of that wall.”
A recent graduate of Kingston University, Harry Grundy studied on a conceptually-led graphic design course – a programme that very much suited his philosophy. “My approach puts the idea at the centre of the work,” he says.
Bluff graduated in classical civilisation, and her appreciation for archaeology has been a solid foundation for an interior design career. “My first job was in Kelly Hoppen’s studio,” she says. “I was inspired by her high-end, minimal products. In 2015, I started Topology, a blog and affordable interior design service. A few months later, it won a small business prize and was shortlisted for an interior design blog award.”
Contributing to Geberit’s 21st-century bathroom project, Bluff captured unique and innovative trends from across the interiors industry. “One idea was bringing the outside in,” she says. “I live in London, where exterior living walls are really popular; this inspired me to include a vibrant living wall behind the shower.”
With a nod to designer Abigail Ahern, Bluff also included dark grey walls to create a cosy feel: “The dark palette is balanced by a skylight, allowing natural light to flood in. Metallic touches add a hint of elegance to the overall look.”
Bluff says Geberit’s AquaClean Mera was perfect for her contemporary space: “Its sleek, cutting-edge design ensures everything in the room is super modern.”
 With a background in fashion, Sarah Al-Taib turned to interiors as a mature student. After graduating, she moved to Brighton, where she works as a freelance commercial interior designer on projects including hotel redesign.
Inspired by mid-century principles, Al-Taib’s retro design for the Geberit 21st-century bathroom brief captures the vintage spirit of colour and decadence, balanced with a peaceful ethos.
“I allowed the geometric pattern of the wallpaper to influence the whole look,” she says. “Geberit’s look is very modern, so I used a retro print to add character, but kept the overall design fresh and modern. I wanted it to have touches of retro luxury and the peace-driven 60s/70s ideology.”
Placing a freestanding bath on a raised area in front of a wide window, and complementing Geberit’s AquaClean Tuma with a floating sink unit, gives Al-Taib’s space depth. Light and air is allowed to move around and underneath the fixtures.
Ministers have, for the past decade, resolutely refused to acknowledge their obligations in dealing with a problem that is believed to be shortening the lives of thousands of people in the UK. Their change of mind, enforced by Thornton and his team of young lawyers, was a major, humiliating climbdown for our leaders and a significant victory for ClientEarth.
“We have been told that the EU has warned Poland it must stop cutting down trees in the Białowieża forest or face an appearance before the European court and a substantial fine,” says Thornton. “I don’t know what it is about rightwing governments but they do seem to like chopping down trees all the time. However, in this case, this should stop Poland in its tracks.”
“At the time, environmental organisations had only one or two lawyers, and they were used mainly to defend activists who had been arrested,” he says. The green movement, he realised, needed more legal clout in Europe – a point demonstrated in Brussels where there were thousands of corporate lobbyists but only a handful of people on the side of the green movement.
So Thornton set up Client Earth and has since amassed considerable backing from various trusts as well as support from music stars such as Brian Eno and Coldplay. Today the organisation has offices in Warsaw and Brussels and has also established strong connections with China and several African countries.
They were putting off, for a generation, a law they had helped draft and which would help save lives
“The government had agreed EU regulations to improve air quality but then said it had no intention of acting upon them until 2025,” says Thornton. “Effectively, they were putting off, for a generation, a law they had helped draft and that would help save lives.” So ClientEarth stepped in and got an injunction from the supreme court – which was, Thornton says, only the second injunction it had ever delivered. “It ordered the government to come up with a plan to comply with air quality standards by the end of 2015.
“Well, they did publish a plan in time but it was such a bad one that we had to go back to the high court and complain. The court agreed. The plan was so bad it was illegal, it said, and so the government was ordered to redo it and publish in April 2017.”
Then, last month, on the Friday before it was due to outline its revised air quality plan, the government announced – after the courts had closed – that because a general election was looming it would not now be publishing its proposals until September. Again the parties went back to court. And once again the government’s argument was dismissed.
This is an approach on which we will probably have to become increasingly reliant, adds Thornton. “In the case of air quality legislation, the government was saying, essentially, that it had no intention of complying with the law until it felt like doing so. The Treasury was saying it was too expensive to implement, even though lives were being harmed. It was a remarkable intrusion by the Treasury into public interest. The court decided to overrule that effort, however.”
The crucial point, says Thornton, is that the Treasury was saying we should not act on air pollution until it got so bad that the EU would be forced to intercede and threaten to fine us. Then, eventually, Britain would have acted. However, when Britain leaves the EU, then there will be no European enforcer looking over ministers’ shoulders. The role of organisations like ClientEarth will become ever more important.
“What happens after Brexit becomes an open question,” says Thornton. “I am worried that the government may introduce a lot of environmental, health and consumer laws – to replace EU legislation – in a way that renders them ineffective. For instance, they might do it in a way that would give ministers far greater powers to change pollution limits.
We are going to have to oblige the government to do things, not ask them
“If you have a government that does not want to comply with a law, who is going to make them comply if there is no EU? In the UK, it is going to be us.
“Some other organisations do litigation but not in the systematic way that ClientEarth does. A lot of environmental organisations are going to have to become tougher in their tactics in the next few years. We are going to have to oblige the government to do things, not ask them.”
Had he not been a lawyer, Thornton says he would have been a biologist. (he is an avid birdwatcher). “However, I decided not to study what I love and then watch it disappear but to become a lawyer to fight to save it.”
This work is now taking Thornton across the globe. ClientEarth has started work, supported by the Department for International Development, to help indigenous people living in threatened forest lands in Ghana, Gabon, the Ivory Coast, Liberia and the Republic of Congo. It is also helping China with the introduction and implementation of new environmental laws, which – among many things –will allow NGOs to sue firms that pollute. “The Chinese really want to do the right thing,” he says. “It is such a contrast to the UK, which is trying to close down the courts to stop citizens and NGOs bringing cases over issues such as air pollution. In China they are flinging open the doors. But not here. It is very depressing. There has been a real backlash against protecting the environment.”
There may well be a swing back by ministers to a more favourable view of environmental issues, of course, but in the meantime it is clear that far greater individual vigilance over green concerns will have to be practised by environment groups and citizens. The example set by ClientEarth over the past year suggests that a great deal of hard graft lies ahead. “We are facing some very challenging times over issues such as air quality, marine protection and loss of biodiversity,” says Thornton. “We should take nothing that the government does for granted.”
This was a staggering, historic high for the anti-European, anti-immigration party that during the campaign was slammed by political opponents as racist, xenophobic, antisemitic and anti-Muslim despite Le Pen’s public relations efforts to detoxify its image in recent years.
Political scientists have warned that no one should write off the French far right after Marine Le Pen’s presidential loss. The Front National has slowly been gaining ground for the last 45 years and its steady electoral increases must be seen in the long term. The issues that the party has sought to focus on and capitalise from – the terrorist threat, the refugee crisis, immigration, mass unemployment, deindustrialisation, voters who struggle to make ends meet – are unlikely to instantly disappear.
“The Front National is not finished,” said Jean-Yves Camus, director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean-Jaurès foundation in Paris. “We have no reason to believe that the job market will change for the better in the next few years. We have no reason to believe that the negative impact of globalisation will stop during the years to come. So there might be a drop in the Front National vote, but if the situation is bad in 2022 [at the time of the next presidential election], they could rise again.”
The Front National’s immediate focus now is the French parliamentary election to be held in two rounds on 11 and 18 June. The party only has two MPs in the 577-seat French national assembly and the current voting system – which does not feature proportional representation – makes it hard for the far right to translate millions of presidential votes into constituency seats. The Front National is hoping to win at least 15 MPs, which would be enough to have its own parliamentary grouping, but much depends on how the left, right and Macron’s new centrist En Marche! movement decide to field opposing candidates.
Party strategists must now decide whether this can be translated to seats in parliament. Le Pen has not said if she will run for parliament herself.
They are blaming Simon Mayo for 'normalising' drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus
Yes, obviously the DJs mentioned booze loads and repeatedly implied that it was fine and nice. As Northumbria’s associate professor of public health and wellbeing put it: “Alcohol consumption is often portrayed as the norm without negative consequences, and just 5% of references on all stations were about sensible drinking.” That’s a lot more discussion of sensible drinking than I would’ve expected.
This is a bit of a soft target, you might think. Leave the guys at Northumbria University alone. If they can get funding for counting the number of times Steve Wright mentions Lambrusco, maybe I should wish them luck. But I don’t. Because it’s another case of people scrutinising how other people talk and vetting them for inadvertent divergences from an approved value system. A mild case, perhaps – these guys aren’t no-platforming Peter Tatchell – but they are blaming Simon Mayo for “normalising” drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus. The study will probably be ignored but, in these inane times, you just can’t be completely sure.
So it might be worth saying something obvious: DJs on the radio have to talk like human beings – the specific human beings they happen to be. That’s the premise of this form of entertainment: natural chat interspersed with music. It’s not high culture but it passes the time in heavy traffic.
But it won’t work if the people at the microphone, desperately trying to keep the energy up, also have to reflect some externally imposed consensus of how life should be lived. That’s Thought for the Day, which is scripted in advance and lasts under three minutes. Any longer than that and it really would drive listeners to drink…
Good morning. This is Martin Farrer with the best of the news this Monday morning.

The pound is down against the dollar at $1.295 but was up slightly overnight on the euro at €1.18.
“The prime minister warmly congratulates president-elect Macron on his election success,” the statement said. “France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities.”
While Marine Le Pen was projected to take about 11m votes, double her father’s score in 2002, it was clearly satisfying to many leaders that the far right appeared unable to get above the 40% mark, which some feared would be breached.
“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité! France chose that today. The great nation was, is, and remains in the middle and at the heart of Europe,” wrote Gabriel on Twitter, using France’s national slogan.
Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!
Chinese President Xi Jinping also congratulated the victor, saying China and France shared a “responsibility toward peace and development in the world.”
“China stands ready to work with France to move the strategic Sino-French partnership to a higher level,” he said according to Xinhua news agency.
“It may be too early to conclude that today’s peak of popularism in world politics is beginning to wane,” the nationalist newspaper said.
“Years later when we look back upon this election, we may find that France made a wise choice for human civilisation in helping to keep it moving forward at such a crucial time, rather than setting it back,” it said.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau telephoned Emmanuel Macron to congratulate him.
“I look forward to working closely with President-elect Macron in the years ahead as we work together on a progressive agenda to promote international security, increase collaboration in science and technology, and create good, middle class jobs on both sides of the Atlantic,” he said in a statement earlier.
Highlighting the cooperation between French and Australian soldiers during World War I, he added: “We have been side-by-side in freedom’s cause for over a century, and we are side-by-side in freedom’s cause in the Middle East today. So we have great work to do to make the ties between France and Australia stronger still.”
Not only did the result come as a significant relief for the European commission, but it will be seen by some in Brussels as a vindication of the EU executive’s unprecedented backing for a candidate in a domestic election. The decision to not comment during the Brexit referendum in the UK, and the question of whether that had been the right way forward, had weighed heavily on officials’ minds in Brussels.
Responding to Sunday’s result, Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party, the largest group in the European parliament, of which Merkel and Juncker are members, expressed the relief felt by many at the result and its wider ramifications. “The election shows that people are ready to fight against extremism and populism,” he said. “For all those who think that France can only be strong in a strong Europe and that Europe needs France to be self-confident and sure of its assets, this result is an immense relief.”
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, and now the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “Congratulations to President @EmmanuelMacron! Everyone is looking to #France now to take the lead in a New Deal for Europe.”
Macron is said to be planning to promote democratic conventions in every member state in order to gauge the type of EU citizens are seeking.
He also made public his desire for the 73 seats currently held by UK MEPs to be transferred to a trans-national European list in a symbolic show of support for further pan-European cooperation.
Indeed while Downing Street welcomed the result, the British government may reasonably harbour some concerns about what the result will mean for the Brexit negotiations.
For the adventurous, and those willing to tolerate some unpredictable weather, the rewards are plenty.
Enlightenment values – tolerance, respect for the importance of fair debate, checked and balanced government, objectivity and impartiality, recognition of international interdependencies – are being trashed. Matters could get very ugly, very fast. It is not just Europe we are leaving, but an idea of Britain.
The chill can only increase as the scale of the gulf between Britain and Europe becomes clearer. If Britain does crash out of the EU, possibly with sanctions being imposed by our former partners because we refuse to pay what they consider are our proper financial obligations, there could be a further run on sterling, a collapse in overblown property values, a second banking crisis and a deep recession. Worse, the enmity towards Europe thus provoked will poison British popular attitudes, as we suffer a lost decade or more, as our weak economy struggles to compensate for lost markets in Europe. Any deal is better than no deal.
We need our principal opposition party to force potential responses into the national conversation – federalising the constitution to avoid the risk of national break-up, rebuilding our relationship with Europe, repurposing our economy and reaffirming a new social contract. These would address the challenges in a way that inspires hope. The shrunken Labour party and its leadership’s preoccupation with yesterday’s failed leftism will be incapable of holding May to account. Or, because of the weakness of its electoral support, it has not the heft to threaten political consequences if she backs off from confronting her party’s right and its media allies.
It is a perfect storm. Corbyn must be persuaded to promise that, in the event of the likely crushing defeat, he will stand down after the election, offering Labour MPs some chance of saving themselves and their party. It is improbable. Maybe Labour will be so broken that a new party, with roots in the best of the British working class and committed to Enlightenment values that unite the best of our political traditions, will have to be started with a clean slate. It’s going to be a long hard road ahead.
Picking up on the same theme, Farage tweeted: “A giant deceit has been voted for today. Macron will be Juncker’s puppet.”
As well as praising Le Pen in recent weeks, Farage declared in a TV interview on Sunday morning that the 48-year-old had “lost weight” and was “looking pretty fit”.
Katie Hopkins tweeted a picture of the pair and the caption: “Macron’s wife has promised him a special new toy from the shops tomorrow for being such a clever little boy.”
Echoing a line used by Le Pen in a televised debate with Macron on Thursday, Simon Richards, the CEO of the libertarian group the Freedom Association, said: “Macron evidently likes older women, so he’ll make an excellent lapdog for Angela Merkel.”
The euro rose to a six-month high in the wake of Emmanuel Macron’s convincing victory in the French election but the upside for the single currency could be short-lived, analysts warned.
In Asian trading on Monday, the euro rose as high as $1.1024 , its highest since 9 November, and also jumped to a one-year high of 124.58 yen against its Japanese counterpart.
“The market already priced in the victory of Macron,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “We saw some additional rise of the euro this morning, but considering the difficulty for Macron’s party to get a majority in the national assembly election, he may not bring higher growth.”
Looking at positioning in the euro, he said, “the market has squared its short positions, but there are no fresh reasons to take long positions, as there will likely be no new positive developments, and limited scope for upside for the euro”.
The muted analysis was partly based on an acknowledgment of the problems facing Macron, a 39-year-old former banker who has never held elected office.
Analysts at BlackRock in a note on Monday: “We expect the focus to shift to French legislative elections in June. These will be crucial for determining Macron’s ability to implement his economic program, which includes labour market reforms that would make it easier for French businesses to hire and fire.”
On the equities market, the mood was upbeat with Japan’s Nikkei bouncing more than 2% to its highest point since November 2015 after resuming following the long spring holiday.
It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened
But it’s Monday morning, he’s just woken up, and he’s in no mood to enter that headspace. When I remark that the album has more darkness and meditations on mortality, he yawns and says, “Maybe, I dunno. Maybe I was just being a jackass.” Has he picked up any adult life skills recently? “Uh I don’t think I have very many… fuck. Ummm. I learned how to wipe my own ass last week,” he guffaws (the joke is later reprised several times). His preferred way of starting an answer is “I dunno”.
Two sides coexist in the DeMarco universe: one laid-back and sunny, one more introspective. A casual listen to the album doesn’t immediately reveal the ruminations within: the music sounds upbeat and melodic, there are odes to love (inspired by his long-term girlfriend), guitars twang serenely. Yet, DeMarco’s father looms large throughout. In opener My Old Man, DeMarco sings about becoming more like his father – “Uh-oh, looks like I’m seeing more of my old man in me” – a relatable-enough sentiment, made more touching by the knowledge that his father is an alcoholic and an addict whom he hardly knows.
Nevertheless, he warns against taking this too literally. “Anytime I see myself becoming something that I don’t necessarily agree with, that’s kind of what I’m talking about there, I guess,” he says. “But that can be taken in several different ways. Take it like a trope or whatever. It doesn’t matter – it’s a pop song.”
The album was written months ago, when his father had become very ill: the last song goes: “The thought of him no longer being around / Well sure it would be sad but not really different / And even though we barely know each other / It still hurts watching him fade away.” Although his father’s health has now improved, the two are still not in touch. Did exploring these issues on the album change the way he views his father? “Um, no. I mean, I was trying to understand it. But I don’t know, I really don’t. It just solidified [the fact] that I don’t understand.”
A much happier relationship is with his girlfriend, Kiera McNally. They met aged 14, got together five years later, and are still together seven years on (“almost eight”, she chirps in the background). The album’s love songs are varied – some are about past fights (“I never meant to make her cry”), some about fluctuations of affection (“sometimes my heart may seem awful cold”), one harks back to the feeling of “seeing her for the first time”, others are inspired by emotions from the distant past.
Considering that a lot of music is about break-ups or falling in love, is it harder to find inspiration in a contented, settled relationship? “It still comes,” he says. “I think that just being in love – being out of love, being in love, being confused by love, wanting love, not wanting love, being scared of love – it doesn’t matter which. There are so many things better than feeling nothing at all. Long-term relationships are like a fucking mountainscape, you know? Things go up, things go down. That’s the fun of it.” What’s his top relationship advice? “Be kind. Be respectful. And be real.”
DeMarco has always railed against the “cool guy fantasy” of rock stars being separate from fans: “the idea of that sexy guy in the band, dark and tall and handsome, looking at his shoes like, ‘Don’t talk to me’ – that has been so unappealing to me for ever.” Most of the fans he encounters are excitable young kids, with the occasional surprise. “It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened a couple times.”
But he also likes to throw curveballs about his life into the mix: he told one interviewer that Kiera has sadly passed away; he informed an audience they had broken up. Recently he said in an interview that he had become a father, prompting family members to get in touch to congratulate him; his mother said it almost gave her a heart attack. “The whole thing with the internet,” he says with a groan, “it’s the wild west. People read into things too much – it’s all horseshit and I like to treat it that way and have fun with it.”
I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth – it’s so twisted
He’s unlikely to repeat the experiment in his new place. He has just bought his first house, which made him feel “kind of weird and old”, after moving from New York to Los Angeles last August (“No real reason why – it just seemed a happening place, so it was like, ‘let’s go give it a shot’”). Now that he’s in LA, has he started to see the appeal of yoga and juice cleanses? “Nah, I don’t think so. I don’t like a juice, I like a smoothie, I like the chunkiness – a smoothie is halfway to a milkshake, and I’d have milkshakes every day if I could.”
It isn’t easy to get a strong opinion out of DeMarco, prime purveyor of contemporary slacker rock (in terms of sound rather than work ethic). What makes him angry? “I don’t get genuinely angry very easily. I don’t know. A whole number of different things. It’s hard to pinpoint what.” I try to stir him up a little. What does he think of life under Trump? “A lot of people are really put out, sad, disappointed… but I dunno. It’s not that it’s not my place to talk about American politics, but it’s a little complicated.” How worried is he about nuclear war? “If we got nuked I’d probably be fried before I even noticed it, which would suck, but would I know? Hopefully nuclear war doesn’t happen, that would really blow ass.”
How does he feel about social media? “It’s bizarre, but I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth. Kids have been led to believe that the number of likes you get on a post or something is equal to your popularity or how cool you are – it’s so twisted and evil. It’s really fucked up and scary, and it’s getting scarier.” He does have Twitter and Instagram accounts but rarely touches them; one of his most recent tweets, from last October, simply reads “#jarjarbinks”.
Social media has also meant that footage of his wilder live shows – nudity, drinking, a notorious incident involving a drumstick – live on online. “When those kinds of things happen it’s usually because I’ve had an off show,” he says. “What I try to focus on is try and play as well as I can and make sure everybody’s happy.”
Until then, does he have any pearls of wisdom to impart? “Nah, I’m good,” he says. “Just tell everybody to brush their teeth twice a day – keep it fresh.”

She now has the right to live and work in the UK permanently after Brexit, irrespective of the outcome of negotiations between Brussels and London.
She swore allegiance to the Queen and completed a “life in the UK” test to prove she was assimilating into British culture, even though she is bilingual, has lived in the country for most of her adult life and is married to a British man with whom she has two British children.
Hawkins, like other EU nationals receiving British citizenship, was handed a standard letter from the home secretary congratulating her on her new status. In a sign of the struggle the Home Office is facing dealing with the volume of applications from EU citizens, the letter was signed by Theresa May, who stepped down as home secretary when she became prime minister almost a year ago.
“I am delighted to finally be British, having felt part of this wonderful and beautiful country for many years now,” said Hawkins. “The ceremony was quick, it felt odd. I have very mixed emotions about it.”
It was a bittersweet moment for the IT consultant. She no longer has to worry about her status post-Brexit but, on the downside, she has learned that she has lost several rights conferred under EU freedom of movement laws.
“Some time after submitting my application in January, I was horrified to learn from a lawyer that in fact by becoming a dual-national British citizen, I have signed away several rights that I had before,” she said.
The first thing Hawkins did following the citizenship ceremony was register to vote in the general election, something that EU citizens are not eligible to do, bar the Irish, Maltese and citizens of the Republic of Cyprus. She said she was “especially pleased” to be able to vote in an election that would affect the future of the three million EU citizens living in the UK.
She said she was concerned about other EU citizens who, after the referendum, discovered they were not entitled to be here because they were caring for a disabled child; were stay-at-home parents; or students who were not notified by the Home Office or their universities that they were required to have private health insurance to stay. “These are the people I worry about, that is what keeps me awake at night,” Hawkins said.
 She has been asked to speak at at an event organised by the Dutch MEP Sophie in ’t Veld, who set up the parliament’s task force in January to look into the rights of people and families affected by Brexit.
Last December, Hawkins described her treatment by the Home Office as being as “absurd as a Monty Python sketch”.
She had sent officials an 85-page permanent residency application along with documents such as historic employment records, council tax statements and proof of absences from the country. However, the Home Office refused her application on the grounds that she had sent in a notarised copy of her passport rather than her original, which she needed for travelling to the Netherlands to handle the paperwork generated by the death of her father.
“As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom, you should now make arrangements to leave,” the rejection letter stated.
I’m a sucker for the American west as seen from a bus and I loved the wild, magical, almost mystical portrayal of the landscape in this coming-of-age road movie by Andrea Arnold. I also loved the tender relationship between the main character, who has run away to join a circus-like group of teenage sales people in the US, and the animals she keeps trying to save. Her familiar longing to save these little creatures from an unpredictable world is almost godlike and echoes the viewer’s desire to see her and her young friends safely delivered to a better future.
Sorry to choose a reissue for the music choice. I have to admit that at some point, I think my late 30s, I decided I had enough music to last me a lifetime and stopped being hungry for new stuff. Music still feels like a lifeline to me but like most other middle aged people, I’d rather listen to music I’m already familiar with. When I left London, I gave away or sold my record collection, most of which was covered in candle wax and jam. I still find it thrilling and the greatest possible luxury to be carrying around all my music in my pocket and be able to find whatever I’m looking for within moments. But I digress. I chose this album because it’s just been rereleased and so counts as something sort-of new. I completely missed Elliott Smith the first time round, I’m not sure how, and was introduced to this album by my husband. It’s now one of my all-time favourites – it’s start-to-finish absolute perfection. I don’t have much tolerance for sad music, but this is gentle and smart and somehow weirdly comforting, and it’s not depressing at all.
I’m so ashamed that I bought the lie that Bernie had no chance of being elected if he won the Democratic nomination. Looking back, I think that was totally wrong. I’ve been ignoring American politics since I’ve lived here, partly because the system seems so messed up and partly because I believed Obama was genuinely a good guy and if he couldn’t do it, it couldn’t be done. Reading this book was a huge eye-opener. I’ve also woken up to the fact that I need to start paying attention and doing what I can. I was just in South Carolina with a friend, helping to register voters for the special election there in June. I hope the extremity of what is happening in the US now gives birth to a truly progressive revolution. The Women’s March was incredible and it’s been heartening to see how many grassroots campaigns are springing up.
Ram Dass was a big-shot Harvard psychology professor in the 60s [under the name Richard Alpert], until he found himself in the office next door to Timothy Leary, which led to drinking the Kool Aid and getting himself very publicly dismissed. In an effort to find a more sustainable high, and to seek the origin of the truth he had glimpsed while taking psychedelics, he traveled to India and found his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. He came back to the US and became one of the archetypal 60s spiritual teachers who spread the teachings of the east to the west. He’s funny and wise and I love him. This book is a recently compiled collection of his writings. Ram Dass is in his eighties now and has lost the ability to speak fluently after suffering a stroke, so this book is read by his pal Rameshwar Das, who does a great job.
But the joke soon became serious. Choco started producing and uploading her songs in 2013, but with new album, Sátira (Satire), released in March, as well as a forthcoming European tour, it’s now a full-time job. The album’s title alludes to the randy figure of Greek mythology, while its cover depicts Choco in a wedding dress with chocolate smeared over her throat. “The idea is to present something that generates confusion,” she says, mimicking a shocked face. “Are you a lesbian? Oh my God, is that chocolate?” Sátira comprises seven tracks – most of which have a heavy dose of reggaeton’s signature tinny percussion and synth-led melodies, over which Choco raps in torrents of staccato and sometimes squeaky Spanish.
There was, however, a backlash from women who said her explicit videos and songs, just like those of male artists, were objectifying women. “It was a sensitive subject at the time. If you saw a women in mini-shorts people were like ‘Argh! That’s machismo,’” explains Choco. “I said, it’s great we are analysing this stuff, but what we are doing is putting more taboo on sex.” She also bumped up against an element of classism – reggaeton is grounded in street culture and is often written off as vulgar. “The idea of progress for middle-class Argentinians is that that you shouldn’t be a bitch, you should be intellectual and go to university,” she says.
Despite sticking two well-placed fingers up at the reggaeton establishment, Chocolate remains a “huge fan” of the genre’s megastars such as Daddy Yankee. “He’s not the bad guy,” she says, “he is just responding to the macho culture.” Would she be his support act? “Of course! But right now I don’t think my music is interesting to his audience. I’m presenting an alternative but I’m also saying ‘fuck you’.” She imagines the concert: “I’m there shouting, ‘Your dick is not important’ … Maybe with some years of talking and with some help from psychologists, they could accept it.”
The creator of Pepe the Frog has symbolically killed off the cartoon frog, effectively surrendering control of the character to the far right.
Matt Furie, an artist and children’s book author, created the now-infamous frog as part of his “Boy’s Club” series on MySpace in 2005. Pepe took on a life of its own online as a meme, before being eventually adopted as a symbol by the “alt-right” in the lead-up to last year’s US election.
In September, Hillary Clinton identified Pepe the Frog as a racist hate symbol, and Pepe was added to the Anti-Defamation League’s database of hate symbols.
But he now seems to have conceded defeat, killing the character off in a one-page strip for the independent publisher Fantagraphics’ Free Comic Book Day. It showed Pepe laid to rest in an open casket, being mourned by his fellow characters from Boy’s Club.
Furie had been attempting to wrench back his “peaceful frog-dude” – whom he has often said he imagined as an extension of his personality – for more than six months. Pepe’s passing has been interpreted of his ceding control of the character.
“While it’s unlikely Pepe’s official death will stop extremists from co-opting his image, this was, perhaps, the most effective way for Furie to reclaim his character; Pepe’s soul has returned to his creator. Rest in Peace.”
“I can see why he must be dismayed that his own creation is being used in this way, so I don’t blame him for trying. In general though, I think it’s a dead end, yes.”
One of the ways the alt-right resisted easy interpretation was “through the kind of subcultural elitism and vague ironic in-jokey tone that Pepe represents well”, she wrote.
“Critics of the alt-right have a tendency to try to outdo them at their own game by ‘trolling the trolls’. This should be rejected in its entirety and not ‘reclaimed’ in any way ... There are many wonderful ideals for us to reclaim like beauty, utopianism, internationalism. Let them have their tedious nihilistic juvenile symbols.”
“Having your creation appropriated without consent is never something an artist wants to suffer, but having it done in the service of such repellent hatred — and thereby dragging your name into the conversation, as well — makes it considerably more troubling.”
Furie and Fantagraphics have been contacted for comment.
But these new ambulances, equipped with sirens and a doctor on board, will exclusively serve injured cows, in the latest of a series of high-profile schemes to improve the wellbeing of the animals, which are revered by most Hindus.
He said the ambulance service had received about 200 calls and was able to attend to about 25 cows a day.
For the past 20 years the trust has been running a similar low-cost ambulance service for rickshaw pullers and rural labourers, and it added cow welfare to its agenda in the past two years.
Sanjay Rai,chief trustee, said he had been interested in helping to protect cows for nearly a decade but had lacked financial resources to establish an ambulance service. “And there was no support from the government side,” he said.
The new state administration of Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu revivalist, has been more encouraging and had allocated the ambulance service a toll-free number, he said. “On a verbal basis they support us, but for financial support they have not started anything yet,” Rai said.
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, won office in 2014 campaigning for a national ban on cow slaughter, and under his tenure there has been a surge in projects to improve the animal’s welfare.
The other side of the growing zeal to protect cows is increasing violence against those perceived to be harming them. In Rajasthan last month a dairy farmer, Pehlu Khan, was attacked by a mob and died from his injuries after being caught transporting cattle.
Movements to protect the cow first became prominent in India in the late 19th century, accompanying a growing political consciousness among Hindus. The issue has frequently been a trigger for tension with India’s sizeable Muslim minority, and has become increasingly charged since Modi’s election in 2014.
Most Hindus eschew beef, but the meat is consumed by some in the country’s south, by many of India’s religious minorities, and by traditionally poorer castes who regard the animal as a cheap source of protein.
Critics of Modi and the broader Hindu nationalist movement argue the threat to cows is overblown and that the animal’s welfare is being used to whip up anti-Islamic sentiment among the Hindu majority.
It was all very well for Minaj to help out fans from around the world with plane tickets, CJ thought, but what about those struggling in the US, who couldn’t even afford to go to school? “Well you wanna pay for my tuition,” she tweeted back at the star.
Six minutes later, Minaj replied. Sure, she said – as long as your grades are good enough:
Over the next few hours, a flood of other hard-pressed students joined CJ in putting out distress messages to Minaj. And the star duly replied, offering support to more than 30 of them in the form of tuition or help in paying off college loans.
“Got u,” Minaj replied.
Shortly after 1am, Minaj felt she had forked out enough promises of thousands of dollars and decided to call it a night.
Ok u guys. It's been fun. Let me make those payments tmrw then see if I have any money left😂. I'll do some more in a month or 2. 😘😘😘💋💋💋💕💕🎀🎀🎀
Hargreaves, who is now retired after founding the Hargreaves Lansdown financial services company, said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of EU nationals before the delicate negotiations over Brexit. However, he said, May should simply “make the gesture” and not wait until Brussels agreed to do the same for UK nationals living in EU states.
It coincides with concern among some senior Brexit backers over May’s approach to immigration after Brexit.
Hargreaves said he was happy to see EU nationals already here maintain their current rights. “Most of those are in work and adding to our economy,” he said. “We are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future, but I think there should have been that comfort given, because they came under different circumstances.”
Wolfson said: “While it is important and essential that Britain controls who comes into this country, and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers … it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge.
“We are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war. If we are too draconian on immigration, it will have two adverse effects on our economy. The first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth, and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world.
“The most important thing to come out of Brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world – that Britain is an open country, a free trading country, one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it.”
Marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures, arguing that universities “must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post-Brexit economy”.
“It is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no-brainer to take students out of the migration numbers,” he said.
“Polling of Brexit voters even shows strong support for this change. People in the north and Midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector. They are simply not worried about student migration.”
State media reports said Xie stood accused of “inciting state subversion” - an offence defined by the country’s criminal law as an attempt to subvert state power or overthrow the socialist system by spreading “rumours or slanders”. The crime carries a possible sentence of up to five years although those considered to be “ringleaders” or to have committed “grave crimes” could face longer jail terms.
Teng described the trials of Xie and other civil rights lawyers as a politically-driven attempt to wipe out opposition to the Communist party at a time of “political, economic and ideological crisis”.
“I feel very sad and very angry,” Teng said by phone from his home in New Jersey where he lives in exile with his wife and daughter.
“These people should be respected by all Chinese people but what the government has done is totally unacceptable and goes against [people’s] fundamental human rights.”

Le Pen says she's not 'against immigrants, just against immigration' – it's like being against juggling but not jugglers
And what of her opponent? For Le Pen, Macron represents “a morbid continuity, littered with the corpses of jobs transferred offshore, the ruins of bust businesses, and the gaping holes of deficit and debt”. (Such apocalyptic metaphors of death and decay are, it must be admitted, very fascist.) Macron himself is having none of it. Le Pen, he says, is “a threat to democracy” who propagates “dangerous untruths”; she leads a party that still promotes “hatred” and is against “liberty”. It’s promising the people “presents”, but they are “lies” that the party could never finance. (One thinks mildly here of £350m a week for the NHS.)
So will the French vote for the people, the Republic, la France, or something else? The Front National, Macron warned this week, is actually “the anti-France party” – an interesting choice of words, given that the phrase “anti-France” was first coined by the French far right who imagined Jewish conspiracies at the end of the 19th century. The civilised choice is clear, but when each side accuses the other of being the enemy of the people, one may forgive the people for thinking they don’t have many friends left in high places.
Going through therapy yourself does not make you a therapist and while I certainly agree that challenging circumstances give you experience and sometimes wisdom to share, they don’t turn you into a miracle worker. You both had a lot to contend with early in your union and should be grateful and proud that you’ve managed to negotiate your way through such difficulties and remain together. The loss of a child is a terrible trauma, unimaginable to those who haven’t endured it, and it’s rare for the relationship of two bereaved parents to emerge completely unscathed.
Finding yourselves the victim of a misfortune that feels so personal changes the way you relate to the world and can easily trigger a sense of isolation and anger towards even those sharing in the grief. I’m not condoning your husband’s cruelty toward you, especially if it was physical or intimidating, but you don’t share details so I can’t judge beyond saying it’s good news that those days are now behind you.
I suspect your husband struggled harder in the aftermath of losing your child because he lacked the vocabulary to express the complex emotions and misery he was feeling, something your six years of therapy won’t have protected you from, but may have helped you to negotiate more successfully.
The greatest issue you face is your belief that the man your husband has become is entirely down to you
Adversity can forge stronger bonds or force you apart, and at present you’re occupying what sounds like a bearable middle ground. My sense is that the greatest issue you face is your belief that the man your husband has become is entirely down to your tender, supportive nursing and nothing to do with his own personal choice and struggle.
You appear to underestimate how difficult depression coupled with the anger of such bereavement would be to recover from, which is odd, as you yourself will have gone through many of the same complex emotions.
Imagining it’s all down to you is unhelpful for both of you. It means you undervalue his own role in his rehabilitation and create in yourself this sense of insecurity that he’s simply slipped on a new skin he could easily shed. Give him credit where it’s due for transforming himself into a man you can love and rely on, rather than one who inspires fear and insecurity.
Your early therapy will have given you an emotional grounding that perhaps made you less vulnerable to later trauma. Losing a child is an awful thing to happen at any point, but it’s certainly guaranteed to rock the foundations of a newly formed romantic liaison.
Now, 40 years down the line you have invested a lot in staying together and improving the quality of your communication, but you have to accept your husband has done some heavy lifting, too.
Instead of fretting that he may simply revert to type, and become ‘angry at the world again’ or dwelling on how he once was, how about giving him credit for his achievement in overcoming grief and depression and emerging a better man and a loving husband?
Sometimes the only way to solve a problem is to change the view. Seen from a different perspective, your husband has gone through a major metamorphosis that he must have fought hard to bring to fruition. The man he once was is not the man he has become. You have to gauge how you feel about him right now, not based on past history, and the first step would be to give him credit for his large role in the welcome transformation. Four decades together is a big investment to squander without compelling cause.
At least the ensuing war of words and public emotion shows that both sides realise just how much is at stake. The truth is that the upcoming negotiations will be incredibly complicated, for both technical and political reasons.
For example, how can we deal with the land border in Ireland? The new arrangements will have major implications for business and trade but also for the hundreds of thousands of people in the north with a passport from the republic. Nearly 20,000 workers commute across the border. These are not technical issues but questions with far-reaching political consequences, including for the peace process.
And Northern Ireland is only one of many such issues, where technical complexity meets political tension. Perhaps most important is the need to reach a deal that defines the rights of expats on both sides. But which rights should these migrants keep? A British citizen living in Spain currently has the right to vote in local elections. Should this be preserved? What about the French student who pays domestic rates at a London university? And how do we process the pension rights accrued by a Polish worker who spends six years in the UK but then leaves? The EU has mechanisms for these situations, and lives were planned around the existing rules.
Whatever the agreement on citizens’ rights, they must be enforceable and protected. So who will watch over them, and what will be the relevant jurisdiction? Theresa May talks of escaping oversight by the European court of justice (ECJ), while the EU wants the ECJ to adjudicate. All of these questions are technically fraught and politically charged, but both sides have repeatedly insisted that citizens’ rights are a priority. So now they must deliver. The UK and European public rightly expect politicians to sort out the mess and minimise the damage to people’s lives.
A second issue is future trade relationships. On a technical level, this should actually be easy to agree. We are not talking about a trade deal between two vastly different economies: on the contrary, the Great Repeal Act will translate the current body of EU law into British law. Thus, on the day of Brexit, standards and regulations will essentially be identical. The questions here are whether either side imposes tariffs, and how to deal with future regulatory divergence. These are standard topics, often negotiated in trade agreements, and they are less complex than the fine detail of migrant citizens’ lives.
With political will, a sensible trade agreement is in reach. A deal that primarily covers goods, rather than investment and services, could easily be passed on the EU side. More elaborate agreements would require unanimity, and the recent near-collapse of the EU-Canada Ceta agreement shows that this can be tricky to achieve. But still, it is in both sides’ interest to avoid a no-deal scenario and a fallback to WTO rules.
A final big issue is the infamous “Brexit bill”. Although economically insignificant, politically this might be the most toxic issue. It is important to understand that even a sum of €60bn would not be at all threatening to the UK’s economic fortunes – it is around 3% of UK GDP, and it would be spread over a number of years. But for politicians the bill is extremely explosive, mostly because of the emotional headlines it will trigger on both sides.
After Brexit, economic and political links between the EU and the UK will be weaker. But the UK will still be the EU’s closest neighbour and an important ally. It is time to discuss in earnest how to soften the damage of Brexit for citizens and business on both sides. And it is time to explore how to structure future cooperation in fighting terrorism. Brexit will not be a success, but aiming for failure serves no one. Goodwill and a sense of perspective are the way to protect the EU and UK alike.

Opening the region to international trading routes would significantly empower northern Syria, circumventing the existing blockade on Rojava caused by the closed border with Turkey and tensions with Iraq.
The SDF’s liberation of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor along the Euphrates would extend territory controlled by the autonomous federation of north Syria to almost a third of the country, compared with the 16% that was governed by the federation of Rojava.
Yousef said that the population of Raqqa would be given a referendum asking if it wanted the SDF, which contains Arab and Assyrian Christian militia, to form a government following the defeat of Isis.
A spokesman for the US State Department said that Syria’s future should be made by the Syrians themselves, reiterating Washington’s position as not recognising “any unilaterally declared self-rule semi-autonomous zone”.
Pizzas, like Chrises, Lesleys or Sams, mostly come in two types. The first type – let’s call it Category A – is the sort you can make very easily from scratch in a regular oven, buy frozen, or order from a standard high-street takeaway. The really important thing about Category A pizzas is the cheese. Provided the cheese has melted and there’s plenty of it, you can hide all manner of sins.
What we feared most of all on our side of the counter was people asking for refunds because the food had been “cooked wrong”. The difficult truth was that no cooking of any kind could have improved the food we sold. The best bet in the whole park was the pizza parlour, which gloried under a comically racist name like Greasy Silvio’s or Flirty Paulo’s Pizza Place. Not because the pizza was any better than anything else, you understand, but because if you slather enough cheese even on the cheapest, most overpriced topping, most people will eat it.
That’s Category A. Then there’s Category B, which you can make at home provided you have a pizza oven and a great deal of patience. The art of a good Category B pizza is mainly in the base – a thin disc of dough, and proper tomato.
What both categories have in common is that, provided you get the essential element right, people will forgive an awful lot. Your Category As can survive the grittiest of pepperoni, the lousiest olives, or pineapple of any kind or quantity, provided they’re laden with melted cheese. Your Category Bs can weather the most pretentious of artichokes, the most obscure mushrooms, the faddiest truffles, as long as the base is crisp and the tomatoes fresh.
And just as there is no greater horror that realising that Chris, Lesley and Sam are all men, there is nothing quite as disappointing as getting a Category A pizza when you want a Category B, or vice-versa for that matter.
Because although a lot of food writing presents Category A pizzas as something you graduate from when you discover Category B and better things – a bit like going to school, but with more grease and less trauma – the truth is that both types of pizza have a time and a place.
Category A pizzas aren’t just the stuff that high-margin, low-quality chains make their money with. They’re also the food that provides plenty of social grease along with the actual grease: at cinemas, while playing cards, Fifa, Cluedo, watching boxsets or Eurovision. There’s an awful lot of emotion in the average bite of a Category A pizza. There’s not a lot of emotional resonance in a trendy sourdough pizza. Unless you are Italian, or loaded, a thin crust and fresh tomatoes will not remind you of your teenage years. A soggy middle, coagulated cheese and dubiously sourced ham will.
I can’t stop writing. Every thought, every idea, the name of every person I meet needs to be recorded. I mustn’t lose this thought. It must be noted; kept; remembered. The world needs to hear my words. If they are lost, all will be lost. Record it. Record what I’m saying. Make sure it’s recording. This will go viral. It will make me a millionaire. You will never have to work another day in your life.
When I arrive at the psychiatric mother and baby unit in Hackney, I am a shell of my former self. Psychosis is bringing me to my knees. I gave birth 11 days ago, and since that day the devil has singled me out as his dancing partner and has not let me rest. I have not slept, I can’t eat without distraction, and the pressure of my speech is so intense that my throat is red raw. I have transformed. I am a small, fragile bird-like creature and my husband can do nothing but stand beside the me that used to be his wife. The me he still hopes is in there somewhere.
On the journey to the ward, I have nearly been sectioned twice. I’m on borrowed time. The police may need to be called. If my baby is taken from me, I don’t want to imagine what I might do. I am frightened to live inside myself. I am ill. I am a thing possessed, an animal, caged. Whenever I have a moment of relative lucidity, I cry out to anyone who will listen – “I am here, it’s me. I fully cooperate with you. I need help. I will take any medication you need me to. I am here of my own free will. I surrender.”
But, within seconds, the Thing takes hold again and drags me back out to sea. I lash out. I will not take those pills. Get them away from me. You are taking away my human rights. I want a lawyer. You cannot degrade me like this and get away with it.
The only thing holding me hostage was the psychosis within. This thing wanted to destroy me.
People always ask me if I knew what was happening when I had postpartum psychosis. The truth is that I was painfully aware of what was happening. Until I started taking medication, and felt numbed, completely zombified, and lost two weeks of my life, I felt everything, and was utterly powerless to stop it or stem the irrepressible torment of my illness.
The tremors of the psychotic quake still resonate throughout our lives three years later. It took me about three months in the mother and baby unit to recover enough to be granted leave to go home. My baby was no longer newborn and our house had adopted the chill that homes left standing vacant absorb.
I am very proud to now be in a position to talk about what happened to me and to my family, in an attempt to open the conversation and to normalise our relationship to these traumatic illnesses and episodes. The horror of what we went through cannot be denied, but I also want to share the tremendous love, growth and power that such a journey can engender.
I always say that I won the psychosis lottery, because I got lucky even in the most unlucky of circumstances. I was lucky to have such incredible NHS staff to offer me love and compassion even in this darkest chapter of my existence. I was lucky to have a husband who could speak to my soul when my mind was not intact. I was lucky to have a baby who was so patient and calm even in the most turbulent of beginnings. I was lucky to have this illness and be able to speak out about how these experiences can ultimately lead to greater understanding of ourselves and those closest to our hearts. We cannot choose what happens to us. All we can choose is how we play the hand we have been dealt. I am not the only sufferer. I am not the only survivor. We are all warriors in our own battles.
During some of my most intense psychotic episodes I was obsessed with recording what I was saying, because I was convinced that the content was essential for the world to hear. Once I listened back to the recordings, I realised that I did want the world to hear them, but for a different reason. I wanted to share them, and our story, to give insight into the debilitating nature of mental illness, something that many people and their families suffer from, and to shine a light on a subject that has, for too long, been kept in the shadows.

We snap the word porn on to images of excess. We understand the meaning of phrases like food porn, property porn, plant porn, travel porn, cocktail porn, not because these are sexy things, but because we associate the word “porn” with the feelings we have when we look at them – a combination of desire and guilt, and fantasy, and disappointment at the celibate reality of our real lunch, our real home.
But while we know what porn means, what it stands for, to judge by the ever-growing number of takes on the subject, the lure of learning about it seems almost as powerful as porn itself. That’s how we excuse our obsession: porn stops being something private and dirty, and becomes instead something you can discuss with your partner’s boss at dinner parties over cheese.
The cycles of thought have rolled between empowering to dangerous and back again, with new incendiary debates on whether it’s right to call porn “work”. What the commentaries have in common though, is that they’re all deeply enervating.
Porn has proved as slippery and ungovernable as sexuality itself. However much people attempt to pick away at it with words, porn remains, this mountain looming above us, its shadow falling over everybody’s private lives. Ironically the act of intellectualising porn, drilling into the stone of it, is the one thing that threatens it, in that it makes pornography a chore and not sex, and therefore much harder for a person to enjoy during their “me time”. Despite featuring nudity and lust, debating pornography is the opposite of talking dirty.
A fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine, the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences, and the European College of Sport Science, Jones is also special adviser (endurance) to the English Institute of Sport.
“When you’re at the Monza Formula One track, you talk to the top people at Mercedes and they say the tweaks they’re making to their F1 cars will eventually filter down and become standard in their regular road cars. I think it’s the same sort of thing with running. You can only understand normal physiology if you can understand perfect physiology.”
So what is it about their physiology that has allowed African runners to dominate distance running so comprehensively in recent years? “Their body types tend to be smaller and naturally leaner,” Jones said. “Their limbs have slightly different proportions, which make them run more efficiently. They have slightly longer shanks; their lower legs tend to be relatively long compared to their thighs, they don’t tend to carry a lot of muscle on their calves and they have quite long achilles, which can be quite advantageous. Their V02 Max [maximum oxygen uptake] may not be much higher than what you’d find in a good class of distance runner in the UK, but they’re much more economical and they’re able to operate at high fractions of their max almost without fatigue.”
Those who can’t abide the idea of drinking the distinctive juice will be relieved to learn there are alternatives.
“A whole load of leafy green vegetables – rocket, lettuces and spinach – are rich in inorganic nitrate that our bodies convert into nitric oxide,” said Jones, who suggested that consuming such vegetables regularly might mean runners did not need to take nitrate supplements.
“My experience from visiting Kenya is that the runners eat a lot of stewed spinach and so maybe their dietary nitrate content is pretty high compared with what we consume. Arguably they may benefit less from nitrate as a supplement because they already have a lot of it in their daily diet.” Runners of all levels can benefit from taking another legal substance, too, Jones suggested.
But no amount of supplements can make up for poor fuelling. “The ability to run fast for long periods depends on how much carbohydrate you can use. You can only store a certain amount in your muscles and therefore getting as much on board exogenously – ie through food and drink – as you run is really important. It’s a real skill and a lot of athletes don’t practise it enough.
“If you try to do it on race day and you are not used to it you will probably have stomach problems and you may find it unpalatable. So we’ve been doing our best to really increase the amount of carbohydrate in the beverages and gels that they take and feed it to them a bit more frequently than in a conventional marathon.
“In the marathon, it’s usually only every 5k [they take on fuel] and if you need to drink 100ml or 200ml of fluid, that’s quite a lot to take on board. If you can take 50ml, 60ml or 70ml every two and a half kilometres then that’s much easier to manage. But you have to make sure the athlete has trained their digestive system, so we’ve had them concentrating hard on that in their training runs in Africa.”
Having spent time with the runners on their home turf, Jones believes he has learned as much from them as they did from him. One eye-opener was the way they approached training.
“Runners will typically do a bunch of medium runs at a steady pace and a long run, say, on a Sunday at a slightly slower speed, and then a couple of interval training sessions. That’s grown out of [Percy] Cerutty and [Arthur] Lydiard [two respected antipodean running coaches] and that’s what people do in the US and all across Europe.
“But in Africa it’s somewhat different. When they go for most of their runs they’re quite slow, but when they do their long run – 22 to 25 miles is not uncommon – they’ll run those sessions quite fast. They might start easily but it will get progressively faster and faster and it’s almost a case of the last man standing. It’s a very specific form of training that we don’t expose ourselves to.”
Rest is another clear point of demarcation between runners in Africa and the west, said Jones.
“They go to bed when the sun goes down and they get up when the sun comes up and often go out and run immediately. For the remainder of the day they chill out. They don’t seem stressed about doing chores or going on social media. They switch off, relax, chat with their friends over a cup of tea. That doesn’t mean they’re any less serious about their training but they do take their recovery very seriously.”
This is something Jones wishes he could have told his younger record-breaking self.
“I think I’d tell myself to do a bit less training. If you look at the Kenyans, they really listen to their bodies. In the western world we are very regimented about our training. We structure it really precisely and we get anxious about it too much. We’re obsessed with running our intervals in precisely the same time. What you get in Africa, and Kenya in particular, it’s much more relaxed. They listen to their bodies and they back off when they need to.”
Despite Kipchoge’s phenomenal performance, some will view , record breaking performance as nothing more than a Nike marketing gimmick. But Jones believes that running is richer for what was achieved at Monza and that the challenge, not just to achieve a “sub-2” marathon, but for everyone to run further and faster, has been thrown down.
“I hope people have been really inspired and motivated by it. It’s been about working out what are the limits of human performance. It’s only when you know what they are that you can work on strategies to overcome them.”

The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”
“I want teams to be worried that they have drawn Argentina,” he said, adding that, if his players were where he intended them to be come the World Cup, it would not matter whom they were up against, not that he will be dancing a jig if the Pumas find themselves facing the All Blacks again. As they are ninth in the rankings, they could be pooled with the holders, New Zealand, and their Rugby Championship rivals South Africa, whose annus horribilis in 2016 led to them slipping out of the top four.
Although 20 countries will take part in the World Cup, there will be only 12 names in the draw: the teams that finished in the top three of their groups in 2015. They have been split into three groups according to their position in the rankings: New Zealand, England, Australia and Ireland occupy the first tier, meaning they will avoid each other; then come Scotland, France, South Africa and Wales; and Argentina, Japan, Georgia and Italy form the third wave.
The other eight teams will be decided after qualifying matches in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Whoever draws Argentina could land Fiji, who were the other victims in England’s pool in 2015, Samoa or Tonga; or two of them.
Akira Shimazu, president of the tournament’s organising committee, has said: “Japan is preparing to welcome the world. We are committed to Rugby World Cup and we’re aiming to deliver the best yet. It will be a celebration of rugby and of Japanese culture as we will show off the best of our country and our hospitality on a global stage. The last World Cup was a great success but our task is not to emulate England but to make it a very Japanese event.”
Before the draw World Rugby will debate extending the residential qualification period for Test players. It is currently three years, but member unions are set to agree a recommendation to increase it to five. The change would not be retrospective and would not prevent the Sale wing Denny Solomona, who recently became available for England under the three-year rule, from touring Argentina with Eddie Jones’s side next month.
Cook said that there had been a “pause in purchases” due to “earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones”.
Apple reported iPhone sales of 50.8m in the first three months of 2017, down by 1% year-on-year. Its revenues grew 5% to $52.9bn, which was just below analysts’ forecasts of $53.1bn.
The company’s financial performance is heavily reliant on the iPhone. While it generated more than $33bn of sales in the quarter, a category it defines as “other products”, which includes the iPod, Apple TV and the Apple Watch, generated just $2.9bn.
While the Apple Watch may be popular with those who use it, it has certainly not created a new platform of customers for the company to meaningfully develop – not yet, anyway.
Reports in the technology industry suggest that the next iPhone will be a significant step forward. According to rumours, it could include wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. But even so, an upgrade to an existing product is unlikely to be a game-changer in the same way that the original iPhone was a decade ago, or the iPod and the iPad were.
It would be foolhardy to call this the peak for Apple, because you can never be sure what mystery products are lurking in its research and development buildings. However, it is clearly becoming more difficult for Apple, Samsung and others to expand the smartphone sector. The devices are now effectively a commodity, particularly in the western world. The market is for customers looking to upgrade every couple of years rather than those looking to buy their first handset.
But a slowdown in its biggest market makes the $250bn cash mountain that Apple is still sitting on even more intriguing.
Analysts at Citigroup, the investment bank, have drawn up a list of seven companies that Apple could buy with the cash. Their candidates are Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla, streaming service Hulu, and video game makers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive.
Some of these deals, such as Disney or the videogame makers, would basically be bolt-ons that would allow Apple to share the success these businesses already enjoy.
Buying Tesla, however, could be transformative and help Apple down the path towards transferring its technology to driverless and electric vehicles. Rumours suggest that Apple may already be working on an electric vehicle anyway.
Even if Apple does not do a deal, it seems its next move will be about bringing its technology closer to our everyday lives, whether through a car or turning its headphones into health monitors, another rumoured plan.
As smartphone sales slow, we are closer than ever to finding out what Apple’s next move will be.
It is true that the last of the five profits warnings in the past four years arrived a few weeks after the end of Pearson’s financial year, but it was a humdinger of a warning. It signalled a cut in the dividend this year, thereby removing the sole source of solace for investors during Fallon’s ill-starred reign. The share price, even after the bounce that accompanied the unveiling of yet another restructuring plan, has halved in little more than two years.
Fallon is correct that the remuneration committee sets his pay. Thus Elizabeth Corley, chair of that committee, and Sidney Taurel, group chairman, must take direct blame for a fiasco that saw almost two-thirds of voting shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Almost a third also opposed Pearson’s forward-looking pay policy. That level of opposition is extremely rare at FTSE 100 companies.
Corley also received a 27% vote against her re-election. She is the former chief executive of giant investment manager Allianz Global Investors, so this was a case of shareholding fund managers voting against one of their own. She should take the hint and go. Pearson’s commitment to “continuing dialogue with our shareholders” on pay will look thin if the same individual is sent out to bat again.
“We’re the world’s learning company,” says the corporate blurb, but Pearson has shown zero understanding of the public anger over undeserved corporate pay. The lesson isn’t hard: when you’ve reported record losses, don’t give the boss a bonus.
Oil industry hopes that the price of Brent crude would stabilise at around $60 (£46) a barrel were dashed last week.
But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week.
For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.
Losing your navigational skills or getting lost even though you are in a familiar setting may provide some of the first indications that Alzheimer’s disease could affect you in later life. This is a preliminary discovery of a remarkable long-term study being carried out by scientists who are searching to uncover how dementia first affects the brain.
The Prevent project – based at Edinburgh University, though it involves several other UK research centres – is intended to detect signs of Alzheimer’s in people while they are still relatively young. Usually, the disease does not show its symptoms until individuals are in their 60s, by which time it has already done profound damage to the brain.
“Alzheimer’s is considered to be a disease of memory but we now think from our early work that the difficulty people are really having – at least to begin with – is not to do with declining memories but to do with their declining ability to visualise the location of objects or themselves,” said Karen Ritchie, one of the researchers. “They are losing their ability to navigate.”
The project – funded by the Alzheimer’s Society – involves the study of two groups. The first consists of people aged 41 to 59 with close relatives who have developed Alzheimer’s and who are considered to be at relatively high risk. The second is made up of individuals whose lives have not been touched by the disease.
The Four Mountains test developed by Cambridge University neuroscientist Dennis Chan is a key ingredient. It involves showing people a picture of a mountain and asking them to identify it in a selection of four other landscapes. There is considerable variation in ability and it provides scientists with a powerful tool to pinpoint those suffering hippocampal degradation. “At present we use computer screens to administer the test but in future we plan to use virtual reality headsets,” said Ritchie.
Cate Latto, who volunteered to take part, feels that loss of navigational ability reflected an important symptom of Alzheimer’s. “My mother developed the disease in late life but even when she was relatively young she could never remember where she put her car keys or where she left her car. As children, we spent our lives hunting through car parks trying to find where she had left it.”
It remains to be seen how effective tests based on measuring navigational prowess will be in predicting who will develop Alzheimer’s in later life. It would also raise ethical issues. If there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer’s why pinpoint those at risk in middle age? What could be gained?
There are several answers, say scientists. Drugs that are currently ineffective may prove far more potent if given during the disease’s early stages. In addition, it is now known that regular exercise, healthy eating and giving up smoking – which improves cardiovascular health – can also help. “There are life-style changes that can help reduce the risk of the disease,” said Ritchie.
Do they kiss their mommas with those mouths? When interviewed, marchers said that Trump was an “embarrassment” and “unwelcome”. In the end, Trump completed his official engagement and veered back to his New Jersey golf course without even popping in to Trump Tower to see if he could find which cupboard Melania had frantically hidden in this time.
What’s the betting that Trump was sitting in the back of his car pulling his maddest, crossest presidential face – you know, the one that makes him resemble Mount Rushmore before the stonemasons started work?
Only recently, Trump was hinting that being the leader of the free world wasn’t all it was cracked up to be and now this happens.
The people of New York need to take a long hard look at themselves. Anyone would think that the only way that they’d want Trump to take another bite of the Big Apple would be if he instantly choked on it and they got to watch.
This system is deemed to be democratic because people elect governments and can always vote them out; it’s capitalist because corporations are constrained by the logic of competition, which prizes efficiency, innovation and infinite expansion. That logic, with its penchant for creative destruction of all things stale and permanent, can produce toxic results – which is precisely why government action is needed. Such, at any rate, is the social democratic consensus accepted by both centre-left and centre-right parties.
The questions of war and security – and the existential imperatives that they impose on the most democratic of societies – have always posed unresolved challenges to this framework, as can be glimpsed from occasional warnings about the military-industrial complex expressed by many a political insider nearing retirement. Thus, standard democratic procedures are regularly suspended as governments demand tighter control over the flow of information, classify more of their internal communications and expand surveillance without any requisite checks and balances.
The standard critique of such practices attacks the undemocratic-because-unaccountable activities of the so-called “deep state”. Rooted in campaigns to defend privacy, opponents aim to make the deep state shallower – ideally by means of legal interventions aimed at restoring transparency and accountability. The real problem, they argue, is with the malfunctioning of democracy – we could easily ignore the capitalist part of “democratic capitalism”: we just need more and better legal instruments to tame the intelligence agencies.
Governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies – they are engaging in toxic activities of their own
Alas, the world in 2017 is not so easy to pigeonhole into the neat compartments of this scheme. Consider just one example: cyber-security. Plenty of rogue states are, indeed, busy hacking the servers of their adversaries in western Europe or North America. Likewise, there’s no denying that non-state hackers, operating for commercial or patriotic motives, have damaged their targets.
They do this for motives that some might view as noble: to identify early signs of terrorist activity, to track down criminals, to disable devices that might be part of sophisticated plots to wreak havoc on our cities. Whatever the motives, we should not lose sight of the larger political effects produced by such actions.
First, the expansion (and even the maintenance) of the surveillance capabilities of democratic governments presupposes a permanent structural insecurity of our communication networks. That insecurity, in turn, gets exploited not just by democratic governments but by anyone else, including all those rogue states and non-state hackers. However, once insecurity is structural, the right response is not more security, but more insurance. This explains why cyber-insurance has become one of the most promising segments of the insurance market, with even sectors like manufacturing (itself increasingly wired up and interconnected) needing to spend more and more to insure against disruptive cyber-attacks.
In essence, cyber-insurance – like any other form of insurance – is a domain of rentiers who are keen to extract a regular premium payment from those needing their services. The truly innovative element here is that the risk that creates this new class of rentiers exists partly – and, one could even say, mostly – because of government activity.
Here, the logic of democratic capitalism is no more: governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies; rather, they engage in toxic activities of their own, which companies mitigate with activities that are either more or less toxic – depending on one’s views about the parasitic nature of economic activities pursued by rentiers. The second political effect of the ever-expanding surveillance apparatus is the disadvantage it creates for small companies and non-profits, not to mention individuals. Remember the early utopian vision of a digital world, where we would all be running our own mail servers and, with time, might even master our own version of the connected home?
Well, today we demand more autonomy at our own risk: given the sophistication of cyber-attacks – which both aim to steal data and overwhelm sites with fake traffic – it’s obvious that the only actors capable of defending ordinary users, be they individuals or corporations, are big tech firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This, too, violates the basic premise of democratic capitalism: citizens are encouraged to seek protection from companies, not governments.
When both spam and security threats are assessed using the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, one can forget about any other, smaller player being able to compete with such firms that use the structural insecurity created by governments to further consolidate their near-monopoly status.
Democratic capitalism is thus always democratic monopoly capitalism – and even more so in its digital version. The idea that the normal imperatives of capitalist competition would exert extra pressure on digital giants seems quaint. There’s no garage big enough to house a startup that can unseat Google, not with its trove of customer data and artificial intelligence.
The third effect of this new post-democratic compromise is that, in presenting cyber-insecurity as a natural rather than human-made problem, it delegitimises the role of law – and politics in general – in mitigating conflicts between citizens and corporations. Consider how we deal with other types of disasters. It would be imprudent to rely on the power of law and politics to ward off floods and earthquakes; insurance, under these conditions, is not an unreasonable option. But none of this prevents us from requiring stricter building standards so as to minimise the damage when the disaster does strike.
The world of cyber-security does not follow this logic. Imagine if the government regularly dispatched a group of well-paid and well-educated saboteurs to weaken the anti-flood or anti-earthquake defences of our houses, leaving us no option but to turn to the private sector for security, either in the form of better defences or better insurance. This is the situation we are in right now; the only difference is that cyber-security disasters are almost entirely human-made and thus avoidable.
Rhetorically, the governments might even agree that, in the face of all these dangers, we all need to strengthen our privacy laws. In reality, though, we all know that it would only result in them sending even more saboteurs – with even more powerful tools – to weaken our defences. Who, under these conditions, would retain any faith in law and politics, rather than accept protections promised by the market, however flawed and expensive?
Cyber-security, alas, is just one of the many examples where the legitimacy of democratic capitalism – as well as of the social democratic parties that have traditionally defended it – has expired, even if its talking points are still in circulation. No wonder that social democratic parties are collapsing, as elections in the Netherlands and France have shown: they claim to be defending a system that no longer walks the talk.
“I know nobody wants to hear it but I am brave enough to say it. The pitch was really dry today. We gave it all the water we had but after 15 minutes it was really dry again with the wind. It was difficult. You could see it … a lot passes you thought ‘why are they playing this?’ But it was difficult. In a possession game you need to have the best circumstances, if possible, in a home game especially, but today we couldn’t have this. That is nobody’s fault; it is only a description.
“It is not nice to drop points at home but now we play away and then we have another home game. We really still enjoy playing at home. It is only a mental issue if you think it is one. We don’t see this. The boys like it here, they like playing in front of their crowd. That is all. Today the atmosphere was really good. People were really in the game. Everybody tried everything and it didn’t work out finally.”
“It’s very frustrating,” Milner said. “Obviously the penalty is my fault and the fact we didn’t get three points is definitely my fault. I have to live with that. Fraser is a top keeper. You have to take those chances. I’ve been around long enough to make sure that doesn’t worry me. I can’t do any more than hold my hands up. Southampton are a tough team to break down.
“We didn’t play as well as we would have liked. The penalty was a big chance and we didn’t take it. We have to win our remaining two games [to be sure now of a top-four finish].”
When my own son, then aged 12, started asking on Sunday nights, “Was that a weekend? Are you kidding?” I knew what he meant. In my family of four, weekends had become as gridlocked as weekdays. My husband and I were shuttling the kids to sports and playdates, cleaning and fixing our old, broken house, doing the washing – in short, tackling all the tasks neglected during the time-crunched week of a two-career household. And in between, we were scheduling pockets of work. What my son was mourning wasn’t the end of a great weekend, but the fact that those two days hadn’t seemed like a weekend at all; they were barely distinguishable from the five days before it.
The other culprit is the thing in your hand that you may be reading this on. Technology binds us to work, and we move through our weekends as if on call, checking email and asserting our loyalty – and importance – by engaging with work. No one wants to look less than totally available in fragile economic times.
Of course, we shop because it’s fun. Shopping has been shown to release dopamine, a hit of instant gratification. This is “passive leisure”, and if we are lucky enough to get time off at the weekend, because we are stressed and overworked, we may be inclined to veg out and binge-watch box sets or tuck into the football marathon, decompressing mindlessly. These impulses sometimes deserve indulging, but the satisfactions are often fleeting.
Many parents feel the pressure to cultivate the perfect weekend – to engineer the perfect childhood
Even though she is exhausted and a little miserable, my friend is praised for her hard work. The Protestant mindset has a firm grip in the culture: live to work, not work to live. We get competitive about our busyness (“I stayed until 9pm!” “I stayed until 10pm!”) because it makes us look wanted and worthy – supply and demand. It is hard to shake the ingrained value that time must be utilitarian and occupied, which is why taking two days off can seem suspect, or a bit like failure.
This more-faster-better mode slips into our family lives, too. Many parents feel pressured to cultivate the perfect weekend as part of an overall effort to engineer the perfect childhood. So our children spend their weekends being lugged from enriching course to high-level sport to a scheduled 90-minute visit with other toddlers while the parents limply hang about the edges of the room. Such problems are a privilege, of course, but it can be hard to resist the madness. How can we not register Charlotte for Mandarin when everyone else is doing it? The fear of falling behind is a powerful force working against leisure. But reclaiming unoccupied time at the weekend may be the most successful parenting strategy of all. In boredom and spontaneity, our kids figure out who they are. Unstructured play brings creativity and joy, while overscheduled kids become anxious young adults.
Since my son’s bemoaning of the weekend, our family has become better at declaring certain weekend days “off”. If I need to work, I try to put a clock on it – a few hours, no more – so it doesn’t drift, consuming those two precious days. We do some shopping and cleaning in the week, or – better – declare a perfect home impossible and live with mess. We try to turn off the devices, and visit the people we love.
We don’t always succeed. I still fall into a Twitter hole, or a kid’s football tournament takes over. Protecting the weekend requires vigilance. The goal is that every weekend includes at least a little unoccupied time, devoid of economic compulsion, to see what might happen. In childhood, those open weekends allowed me to stumble towards myself. Later, the kid with the tape recorder became a film critic, and a writer. My weekends revealed who I was, just as our crunched, chaotic ones tell us more about who we are than we might like to know.
Mrs May is not the most awesome political genius to walk the earth. Far from it. She has little in the way of solid achievement to show for her nine months at Number 10 and has spent her election campaign swaddled in opacity about what she would do with a five-year term. Mrs May only gets to look unbeatable because of the paucity of the competition provided by a Labour leadership that combines unelectable hard leftism with utter ineptness.
It was not “inevitable” that we would have this “Brexit election” at all. This is happening because of the narrow victory for Out in the referendum last year. Only a small amount of mental energy is required to envisage an alternative history that would have produced a different result. A Labour party under more credible leadership that had demonstrated some enthusiasm for the Remain cause could very well have tipped the result the other way when the country made its choice about Europe.
As Labour stares into the jaws of disaster, it is essential to grasp that there was nothing pre-ordained about this rout. The electoral evisceration of Labour wasn’t written in the stars. Defeat is not to be blamed on the whims of the gods or the tides of the moon. This calamity can’t be put down to the caprice of fate. The Tories were handed this opportunity to smash their way to a big majority because Labour made terrible choices and is under abysmal leadership.
A thumping Tory triumph now looks unstoppable. It was never inevitable.
There was no last-gasp escape for the dishevelled Lancashire club, just as there is no miracle cure for the ills that have afflicted Rovers since they were taken over by an Indian chicken-processing corporation in 2010. Blackburn were 14th in the top flight back then; now they are heading towards the third tier, a level unknown to them since their return in 1980.
The fall would be easier for the club’s fans to tolerate if they had confidence that the team have reached rock bottom. But Rovers are around £100m in debt, many of the players are due to leave this summer and the owner has given no indication that it has the will or ability to stop the slide, let alone reverse it.
Two telephone calls remain the only contact that Tony Mowbray has had with Venky’s since being appointed Blackburn manager in February. He says he is scheduled to fly to India “in the next week or two” to find out how seriously the owner intends backing a promotion attempt. Given that the club have spent £250,000 on players in the past two years, optimism at this point would seem misplaced. The table says that goal difference did for Blackburn in the end, but the main cause was ineptitude away from the pitch, along with neglect or worse.
It was fitting, in a way, that Blackburn’s relegation came after an ultimately useless victory, a denouement highlighting the potential that has been wasted at the club. The spirit shown by players on the pitch and supporters in the stands was overridden by events beyond their control.
Rovers fans rode a whirl of emotions, lurching from optimism to joy, then to fear and, finally, sorrow and rage. “We want our Rovers back,” the 1,650 demanded after the final whistle here. Who knows when, or whether, they will get their wish?
It had all started like a dream for Mowbray’s team. Charlie Mulgrew shot them into the lead in the 10th minute with an immaculate free-kick, curling the ball into the top corner from 25 yards. Rovers fans began singing and dancing because as things stood, their side were on course to survive. That prospect grew brighter when Blackburn scored again six minutes later, Danny Guthrie grabbing his first goal for the club thanks to a excellent work by Sam Gallagher, a deflection off a defender and weak goalkeeping by Daniel Bentley, who allowed the ball to trickle over the line. With so many things going in Rovers’ favour, it was no wonder there was suddenly conviction in the away fans’ chants of “We are staying up”.
But then Forest scored against Ipswich Town, and Brentford fans gleefully relayed the news with chants of “You are going down”. The travelling contingent retorted with cries of “We’re going to win 3-0”. Not the most sophisticated tit‑for‑tat, admittedly, but the soundtrack gave the atmosphere an extra fizz and tension.
And Rovers did create chances to make it 3-0. Gallagher, on loan from Southampton, was so committed to Blackburn’s cause that he collided with a goalpost as he tried to divert a cross from Elliott Bennett into the net, but his bravery was unrewarded as his shot flew over the bar. Derrick Williams also fired over from close range before Gallagher got another opportunity just before half-time, only to be denied by David Raya.
Brentford had been loose in the first half but improved in the second. So, elsewhere, did Forest. Blackburn’s hopes deteriorated further when Lasse Vibe pulled a goal back for Brentford, superbly flicking Harlee Dean’s low cross beyond the reach of David Raya in the Blackburn goal. Blackburn fans were struck dumb. Mowbray clasped his head in his hands.
Brentford continued to attack, intent on ending their own season on a high in front of a home crowd. Blackburn did not surrender even as their chances of survival grew more remote. Craig Conway rocketed a penalty into the net after being fouled by Dean, whose season ended a little earlier than everyone else’s when the referee showed him a red card.
Elsewhere, Birmingham’s match ended earlier than expected, too, as the referee blew for full-time prematurely, at least if the fourth official had been correct when indicating the amount of time that would be added on.
That was just another irritating quirk on a sorry day for Rovers, to be filed alongside the fact that Newcastle United were confirmed as champions: Rovers did the double over them this season.
So Blackburn ended with a two-goal win that took Mowbray’s haul since replacing the sacked Owen Coyle to 22 points from 15 matches. If they had gained points at that rate all season they would have finished in the top half. But Rovers got their act together too late. Their next performance will be in League One.
And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (£78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn’t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (£356m).
One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: “Why did you do it?” At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: “I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.”
Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.
He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors’s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.
Why did I do it? I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer
Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?
“There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,” he says.
Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors’s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year’s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (£10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel “sick”.
“I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,” he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.
But it didn’t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. “I didn’t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,” he says. “It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You’re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don’t get to go outside and say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’”
Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn’t really see anyone who wasn’t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn’t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.
And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company’s liking. He did as he was told.
“Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?” he writes. “Should any such line be drawn at all?” I’m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?
“I think it’s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that’s what I wish I had done much earlier,” he says. “But it’s very easy for me to say: ‘Follow your own morals and it will be fine.’ But it won’t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you’ll begin to run into trouble.” He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it’s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.
I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. “I don’t want to say,” he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned “a seven-figure sum”. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.
“You get these bonus cheques, but there’s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I’ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.” At £1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.
But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn’t perform well, and he felt short-changed.
I didn’t think about the system as a whole. You never say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’
“Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It’s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn’t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It’s more like you’ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.”
Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.
I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says – he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. “The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.”
But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He’s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? “I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,” he says, “but I don’t think so.” He says he couldn’t do it without becoming obsessed again.
Does he miss the money? “Of course, it’s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn’t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.”
A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: “Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn’t spend much time thinking about it – at least not until it was too late.”
“That was the only thing that I really liked,” he says now. “Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.”
I think he should stick to lecturing.
Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time – but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.
During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo Häyhä. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when Häyhä was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: “I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.” Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed “snipers”. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees – no matter what their job description is.
I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.
I wouldn’t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I would become
“Don’t worry,” I was told. “We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.” I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee’s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.
Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.
Fernando Gaviria claimed his first Grand Tour stage victory as what looked like being the most straightforward day of the 100th Giro d’Italia blew apart in howling winds in Sardinia.
Gaviria took the stage win and the race leader’s pink jersey after the Colombian’s QuickStep-Floors team led the decisive break when echelons split through the peloton on the final approach to Cagliari.
A bunch sprint had been expected at the end of the short, flat 148km stage from Tortoli, but the peloton was buffeted by winds reaching 40km per hour in the final 30km. As the road changed direction several times, the winds turned from crosswinds to headwinds again and again, splitting the pack apart and meaning only four riders crossed the line on the same time as Gaviria.
Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas fought gamely to join the QuickStep-led escape before dropping back, but he finished with the main contenders to sit 11th overall, 23 seconds down on Gaviria.
She in turn called the former economy minister an arrogant, spoilt, cold-eyed, “smirking banker” who was colluding with Islamists, complacent on terrorism and intent on “butchering France” in favour of “big economic interests”.
Both accused the other of taking French people for imbeciles. At one point, after a long attack saying Le Pen was lying to the French public, Macron snapped: “I’m sorry, Madame Le Pen; France deserves better than you.”
Snap polling by Elabe for BFM television just after Le Pen had left the TV studios, accusing Macron of “lies and aggression”, found that a clear majority felt the centrist candidate had been the most convincing. Viewing figures said 16 .5 million people watched the debate.
French media on Thursday declared Macron the winner of a “dirty debate”. Le Pen was criticised for her “permanent aggression” and even normally sympathetic publications found her “unconvincing”.
Libération accused Le Pen of “multiplying attacks and provocations … and thus avoiding any serious debate” while Ruth Elkrief, political editor for BFMTV declared it “not worthy of a presidential election campaign”.
On jobs – one of the biggest concerns in a country that has struggled with decades of mass unemployment — Macron told Le Pen: “Your strategy is simply to tell a lot of lies and just to say what isn’t going right in the country.” She said he favoured “uncontrolled globalisation” and would sell off state assets to the highest bidder.
Although Le Pen was under pressure to flesh out her policy proposals, she spent more time attacking Macron and the record of the outgoing Socialist government.
Terrorism was another key issue after a series of deadly attacks killed more than 230 people in France in just over two years. Le Pen accused Macron of an “indulgent attitude” towards Islamic fundamentalism and said he was slack on fighting extremism. He replied he would be “uncompromising” on terrorism – which he called the biggest issue of the next few years in France – and said the state had to look at the social issues behind why so many terrorists who attacked France were born and raised in France. Le Pen, who this week said “globalisation and Islamism” were the main threats to France, retorted that Macron was lax on Islamism and disregarded French secularism.
Le Pen restated her plan to ban religious symbols from all public places, which would include the Muslim headscarf. Macron warned that her proposals would divide France and lead to “a civil war” and “that’s what terrorists want”. He said: “The terrorists want there to be divisions between us” and accusing his rival of “hate-filled speech”.
On the European Union, the candidates could not have been further apart. Le Pen, who wants to hold a referendum on France leaving the EU, and Macron, who wants closer cooperation, traded more insults on the subject. Le Pen said Macron as president would allow France to be crushed by its economically powerful neighbour Germany and would “lie prostrate” before the powers of Berlin.
“France will be led by a woman, either me or Mrs Merkel,” Le Pen laughed, referring to the German chancellor. He meanwhile attacked her over her muddled stance on the euro. “The euro is the currency of bankers. It’s not the people’s currency,” Le Pen snapped back. Macron responded: “The euro is important. It’s not just a policy.”
Polls this week conducted before the TV debate showed Macron leading by 60% to 40% before the final-round vote on Sunday.
The stage-managed live TV sparring-match is a staple of French election campaigns. The format, in which the candidates face each other across a table for the cameras with no studio audience, has not changed for 40 years. But this bad-tempered exchange, which saw Macron and Le Pen repeatedly exchange insults with rather than expounding on policy, represented a political first.
After France’s two main parties, who had shared power for decades, were knocked out in the first-round vote last month amid anti-establishment anger, the two candidates who faced each other across the table were relative political novices.
The very fact that Le Pen appeared in the debate was considered a major step in normalising her party. In 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the final, the right-wing Jacques Chirac refused to debate him on TV for fear of “normalising hate and intolerance”.
Le Pen has tried to gain a grassroots presence across France and soften her party’s image, attempting to shake off the old jackbooted image of anti-semitism and racism under her Holocaust-denying father, but Macron in rallies has continually described her party as the “party of hatred”.
He said she lacked any knowledge of facts and was “feeding off” French people’s unhappiness. He said she was a “parasite” on the system that she was criticising, manipulating voters’ woes. “What class!” she interjected witheringly.
Le Pen wants a France with closed borders and to prioritise French people over foreigners for jobs, housing and benefits, to send illegal immigrants home, to turn away from the European Union and to abandon free-trade deals. She hopes to solve unemployment by blocking immigration and taxing companies who hire foreigners.
Macron wants to increase European Union cooperation and says France cannot escape the globalised world. He wants to loosen strict labour regulations and reform the eurozone with a common budget.
Minutes before the legally enforced ending of the campaign, Macron’s movement issued a statement warning about a “massive hacking attack”. En Marche! explained that these documents had been hacked over a period of several weeks, that some of them were genuine and without any compromising content. Other documents in the data trove, however, appeared to have been fabricated.
Macron had already become, by far, the most targeted candidate by hackers during the campaign. In February, his movement’s computer systems were attacked by hackers based in Ukraine and needed to be shut down for several hours.
The timing is evidently aimed at bringing chaos to the last hours of the French campaign, but it is doubtful that the Macron leaks will have a real impact on the final result.
First of all, they are not a real surprise. French voters have already heard and read about the similar hacking attacks in France and other countries, notably during the US elections. And the spreading of fake news has become commonplace in France too.
Secondly, at first glance, no huge or obvious scandal seems to arise from the leak: journalists and experts will need months to properly study the content.
For months French voters have been living through a campaign full of twists and turns, violence and divisions. Families, friends and colleagues are divided and will remain so for some time
This latest attack is probably too obvious to substantially alter the result on Sunday and in fact, it might have the opposite effect from what the hackers had hoped for. This clear attempt to influence the democratic process might in fact convince some voters to turn up who had originally planned to abstain.
International support for landmine clearance has fallen below $400m for the first time in a decade
The effects of war are felt in the devastation of services; the destruction of economies; the fragmentation of families and communities; long-term injuries and illnesses; and, of course, the absence of loved ones. But you cannot restore water supplies or reopen schools or plant crops if you cannot cross the land safely. You cannot recover psychologically while living in constant fear of setting foot in the wrong place. The converse of that depressing truth is that investing in munitions destruction and clearance pays dividends. It is the first step to solving many more problems.
“The accident happened when the bus was descending on a steep hill in rainy conditions,” regional commander Charles Mkumbo said. “We are still investigating the incident to determine if it was caused by a mechanical defect or human error on the part of the driver.”
The pupils killed in the accident, which occurred at about 9.30am in Karatu district, were aged 12 to 13, and from the Lucky Vincent primary school on their way to visit another school, Mkumbo said.
Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, described the accident as a national tragedy in a statement.
The first comprehensive research on so-called revenge porn has shed light on the “mass scale of victimisation” across Australia and its sometimes devastating impact.
“Image-based abuse has emerged so rapidly as an issue that inevitably our laws and policies are struggling to catch up,” wrote Dr Nicola Henry of RMIT, the lead researcher on the study.
Twenty per cent of respondents had had images or videos of a nude or sexual nature taken without their consent; 11% had had them shared; and 9% had received threats that images of themselves would be shared.
Men and women were equally likely to be victims but the rate was higher among younger people: one in three teenagers aged 16 to 19 and one in four aged 20 to 29 reported at least one form of image victimisation. Marginalised groups – Indigenous and gay, lesbian and bisexual Australians, and those with a disability – were especially vulnerable.
The online survey of 4,274 people aged 16 to 49 only captured those who had discovered their images had been distributed, mostly on social media – but victims whose images had been shared in closed online communities dedicated to the practice may never find out, she said.
“Even though these findings in themselves are showing a high rate, it’s quite possible that people are the victims of image-based abuse and unaware of it … “There’s a hidden dimension that you just can’t capture with a survey.”
Though victims were equally likely to be male or female, the majority (54%) reported that the perpetrator was male. Women (39%) were more likely than men (30%) to be victimised by an intimate partner or former partner.
But researchers had opted for the term “image-based abuse” over “revenge pornography” to broaden understanding of the range of motivations and perpetrators, and to capture its damaging psychological toll, said Powell.
Previous findings had shown that images were used as means of abuse for a range of reasons, including control, intimidation, sexual gratification, monetary gain and social status building.
“‘Revenge porn’ does make you think of that jilted ex-lover scenario, or the public shaming aspect of the image, but it doesn’t reflect the full nature of the behaviours or their harms,” said Powell.
“Victims do report experiencing this as a form of sexual violation or sexual violence.”
Eighty per cent of victims who had been targeted by threats to distribute an image reported experiencing “high levels of psychological distress” that researchers found to be consistent with a moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety disorder.
Overall victims of any image-based abuse were almost twice as likely as non-victims to report experiencing high levels of psychological distress.
Only Victoria and South Australia have specific laws against the distribution of intimate or invasive images without consent – but the survey found overwhelming support for such a measure, with four in five respondents agreeing that it should be a crime.
A dedicated helpline, similar to the Revenge Porn Hotline established in the UK in 2015, could be established to help support victims.
Researchers also noted the responsibility of social media platforms and internet providers to take action on preventing image-based abuse and supporting victims through the creation of safe spaces online.
The mandate of the outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, officially ends at midnight on Sunday 14 May and he is expected to vacate the Élysée earlier that day.
On Monday 8 May, the interior minister, Matthias Fekl, will officially announce the result of the presidential election. The first results, which came in at 8pm French time (7pm BST) on Sunday evening, are only estimations based on the initial count from several hundred polling stations that closed an hour before.
The handover of power takes place next weekend. The ceremony follows a well-rehearsed form: Macron will go to the Elysée and be received in the courtyard by Hollande. After a brief chat, Hollande will leave the presidential palace accompanied by the Republican Guard.
 Macron’s first engagement as president will be to pay tribute at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior at the Arc de Triomphe and visit Paris city hall.
Of those to be recruited to his government, Macron said: “I will choose them for their experience, their competence, what they have done and not for what they represent or their political weight ...
“They will be people who are important mayors, regional or general council presidents; people who have sometimes been ministers, but who do things and who will be able to run an administration and conduct a public policy.”
For other ministries, he is expected to fish from the Socialist and centre-right Les Républicains pools, luring experienced and respected politicians such as the former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s labour minister Xavier Bertrand from the right and the Lyon mayor, Gérard Collomb, from the left.
Christine Lagarde, the current IMF managing director, has also been mentioned.
“This is my first season and I found a lot of situations, a lot of players. Pochettino has been working there for three years and has changed a lot of players, and is working very well. For me Tottenham are a really strong team and it’s normal to see them fighting for the title.
“But if you consider the squads, the numbers in each squad, you can see the difference: one team prepared to play the Champions League with 25 or 26 players, and another prepared to play only the league, the FA Cup and the League Cup. My expectation was a great challenge in this league against Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool. Next season for us it will be the same. But we have one year to work and then the possibility to go into the market and choose the right players on my idea of football.”
The prospect of Conte adding an entirely new spine to the side is very real. “We are building,” he added. “We started to build this season. If we are able to win, it’s a great achievement for us. When you start to build, it’s very difficult to carry on winning. This is a process. No one thought Chelsea could fight to win the title and be in the FA Cup final this season.
“For sure, we are in a moment of transition. We are losing a lot of top players who have written the story, the history, of this club. This season we lost Branislav Ivanovic, we lost Mikel John Obi and next season we’ll have lost John [Terry]: three big players. Don’t forget Oscar, who went in the transfer market when we sold him.
“But don’t forget we are building to try and create a good foundation to support not only for the next season, but for many years, and to make sure Chelsea stay always in and fight for the Champions League. To try and win the Champions League and the title.”
This month sees the 20th anniversary of the granting by New Labour of independence to the Bank of England.
It was not full-scale independence but “operational independence” in monetary policy: that is, the freedom to change interest rates without having to consult the chancellor. The Bank is still the Treasury’s agent in other matters, such as decisions about the nation’s currency reserves.
The Strand Group at King’s College London held a high-powered conference to mark Bank independence last week: but against the background of elections and all this Brexit nonsense, the anniversary of what was a controversial event at the time seems to have passed non-aficionados by.
I myself was against the move at the time, and while hardly anyone questions the idea now, I am still inclined to take the Zhou Enlai view. This is a reference to then Chinese premier’s reply in the 1970s when he was asked what he thought the consequences of the French Revolution had been. He famously replied: “Too early to tell.” This has gone down in fake history as a witty reference to the events of 1789, but an official who was present said Zhou was actually referring to the riots in Paris in 1968.
Even critics of Gordon Brown give him, and his economic adviser at the time, Ed Balls, credit for making the Bank independent in this area.
It is noteworthy, however, that most of the Brexiters who go on about parliamentary sovereignty seem to have no qualms about placing decisions in the hands of unelected officials.
The granting of independence was the final resort of British policymakers in the long, and losing, battle for Labour and Tories alike to control inflation. Both parties had problems with incomes policies in the 1970s. The Tories brought monetarism from 1979, but that failed – indeed, the doctrine was even subsequently disowned by Milton Friedman, its most prominent advocate. Then came Chancellor Lawson’s obsession with the success of the Germans in controlling inflation; his instrument was to be membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. When Margaret Thatcher vetoed that, Lawson directed the Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market so that the pound “shadowed” the Deutschmark.
When he was rumbled, there was hell to pay, ending with Lawson’s dramatic resignation in 1989. Ironically, after Lawson went, Thatcher was finally worn down a year later, and the pound joined the ERM in 1990.
Membership of the ERM then ended in sterling’s ignominious exit from the mechanism on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. Amazingly, the British establishment did not seem to be aware of what the Germans knew only too well: namely that the historic reunification of Germany at around the time we joined the ERM would have serious inflationary consequences, because of the massive cost of absorbing the run-down East German economy. It was exactly the wrong time to subject Britain to what was effectively German monetary policy.
John Major was prime minister, and he took the rap. Now, although some fanatics had been trying to reverse the result of the 1975 referendum (a two-to-one verdict in favour of remaining in the EEC we had joined in 1973) from the start, we can really date the onset of the cancerous growth of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party to the early 1990s. The general election of 1992 saw the end of the dominance of pro-Europeans in the parliamentary party and the rise of what the beleaguered Major termed the Eurosceptic “bastards”.
Meanwhile, after the ERM, the next supposed panacea for British inflation was central bank independence. While this period has coincided with low inflation, it has not necessarily caused it. Most industrial countries have had low inflation in recent times.
However, central bank independence is but a sideshow when it comes to the major economic crisis of our times, which is the prospect of Brexit.
Well, it is an open question whether the poison has been neutralised. Quite apart from that, we are in the lamentable position where a Tory party that used to have the national interest at heart is now sacrificing everything to its own preservation. Yes: thanks to Theresa May’s lame acceptance of the result of a referendum conducted on a false prospectus, the poison has now spread to the nation at large.
We have a government that really is, in Angela Merkel’s word, “delusional” about squaring the circle: obsessed by the immigration she failed to control at the Home Office, May wishes to leave the customs union and the single market while cherrypicking her way back into the best bits. This is impossible. As often happens, the people running this country do not seem to realise that our continental partners have their own interests, and tend to say what they mean.
It is not too late to rethink. My old friend Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, says that it is not irrevocable. It is reversible. There is still an opportunity for our leaders to see sense, and own up to the people.
I know the people have spoken. They spoke in 1945 and said one thing, and in 1951 and said another. Throughout the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, they said one thing, and then another. To coin a phrase: it is a people’s privilege to change its mind.
William talks of his “pain” and “shock”, plus “the humiliation heaped on his wife”. What he doesn’t explain, though, is why it’s necessary to revive all that pain and angst half a decade later – especially since, quite clinically, no French court is going to award him more than a (perhaps humiliating) fraction of the damages he seeks.
A future monarch needs a better legal advice team. Or maybe just have a word with the Duke of Edinburgh before he goes.
General manager Sandy Alderson announced the suspension in a brief statement before the game, saying that Harvey had been sent home but declining further comment. The team said the suspension was effective Saturday.
“We are going to keep it in house, the way it’s supposed to be,” manager Terry Collins said. “We hope to put it behind us and move forward.”
Left-hander Adam Wilk was called up from Triple-A Las Vegas to start in Harvey’s place. The three-day suspension removes Harvey from the 25-man roster. The Mets transferred Noah Syndergaard to the 60-day disabled list to open a spot on the 40-man roster for Wilk.
Collins indicated that he was aware that a suspension could be on the horizon for Harvey.
“There were some moves made last night because we felt this might occur,” he said.
In his first season after having a rib removed to treat thoracic outlet syndrome, the 28-year-old Harvey has struggled to a 2-2 record with a 5.14 ERA over 35 innings. Harvey is coming off two of the worst starts of his career, allowing 12 runs over 9 2/3 innings with eight walks in a pair of losses to Atlanta.
He missed the 2014 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Harvey’s best season was in 2015, when he went 13-8 with a 2.71 ERA. But that year, in his first postseason, he missed a mandatory workout the day before the NL East champion Mets traveled to Los Angeles for their playoff opener against the Dodgers. He apologized for his late arrival, for which he was fined. Harvey offered no public explanation for his tardiness, saying he simply “screwed up.”
Harvey’s suspension is the latest blow for the Mets, who have been plagued with injuries this season. New York is missing ace right-hander Syndergaard (latissimus dorsi), outfielder Yoenis Cespedes (hamstring), first baseman Lucas Duda (elbow), catcher Travis d’Arnaud (wrist), left-hander Steven Matz (elbow), right-hander Seth Lugo (elbow), third baseman David Wright (recovery from neck surgery) and outfielder Brandon Nimmo (hamstring). Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera left Saturday’s game with an injured left thumb.
The team already has dealt with several public relations issues this season. Syndergaard initially missed a start with what the Mets said was biceps and shoulder discomfort and then made his next start against Washington after refusing to undergo an MRI. He was removed with the lat injury after only 11 batters. Syndergaard issued an apology Saturday to Mets public relations director Jay Horowitz and to members of the media for an outburst on April 27.
Backup catcher Kevin Plawecki was at the center of a controversy Friday when a sex toy could be viewed in his locker in a photo the Mets tweeted of T.J. Rivera wearing the star-of-the-game crown after New York’s come-from-behind victory.
Collins had a closed-door meeting with the team to address the situation, which Plawecki described as a prank.
The artwork emerged overnight on the Castle Amusements building near the ferry terminal, which connects the UK with mainland Europe.
The mural, which was confirmed by Banksy’s representatives to be a genuine work by the elusive artist, is his first comment on the Brexit vote last year.
I have a fondness for softly spoken cheese that is just a short step from milk
Back at home, I left the burrata in a dressing of orange zest and juice, crushed coriander seeds, wine vinegar and a few flakes of dried chilli. Once the cheese had taken up a little of the flavours from the marinade, we ate it alongside a spinach and blood orange salad. One wobbly, barely set cheese and a handful of spinach each. The young leaves, their points as sharp as a spear, appeared again in a hastily put together lunch with shoots of wild garlic, the two greens forming a soft pile into which I tucked pieces of taleggio. Once heated the cheese formed pools that spilled down on to the thick hot toast beneath. I caught it just as the cheese started to liquefy, before it had a chance to colour and become chewy.
These cheeses, along with soft, mousse-like goat’s cheeses, are light enough to fold into the eggy clouds of an omelette or to spread straight on to sweet white brioche and top with early strawberries. There is something fleeting about these cheeses, with flavours that are pure and unchallenging. There is a delicate note that makes them candidates for breaking into small pieces and tossing with young peas, fresh from the pot, in lieu of butter. Or how about folding pieces of taleggio or mozzarella into warm steamed rice, so the cheese softens rather than melts, lightly coating the grains. I rather think basil is then called for or chopped leaves of tarragon.
Taleggio melts particularly easily, but you could use fontina or any soft cheese should you wish. Wild garlic leaves have a short season, so I tend to make the most of them while they are here. I have yet to have any success with planting them in the garden.
Wash the spinach thoroughly and remove the toughest of the stalks. Without shaking the leaves dry, put them into a large saucepan over a moderate heat, covered tightly with a lid.
Grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat just before it turns gold
Let them steam for a minute or two, then turn the spinach over, and continue cooking until the leaves have wilted. Drain and refresh the leaves in iced water. Squeeze the leaves in the palm of your hand to remove as much water as possible, then separate them as best you can. If the leaves are very large, chop them roughly.
Mix together the crème fraîche and mustard in a mixing bowl. Put the spinach in the bowl then fold into the mustard crème fraîche and a little salt and black pepper. Toast the pieces of sourdough until lightly crisp and golden on both sides. Remove the stalks of the garlic leaves and cut them into small dice. Keep the leaves intact. Cook the leaves and chopped stems for a minute or two in the butter, just until the leaves wilt. Remove, drain and stir in the spinach.
Get the oven grill hot. Pile the spinach and garlic mixture on to the toasted bread. Tear the taleggio into large pieces and tuck among the spinach. Grate the parmesan and scatter over the top then grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat before it turns gold.
Buffalo mozzarella is fine here, too, but use burrata if you can get hold of it, for its texture – which is softer and more fragile.
Make the marinade by grating the zest of the blood orange into a deep container large enough to take the cheeses. Halve the orange and squeeze the juice into the zest. Add the olive oil, the dried chilli flakes and the red wine vinegar. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the coriander seeds and add to the marinade with a coarse grinding of black pepper. Open the cheeses, drain them of their packing liquid then place them in the marinade. Turn them over to coat with the marinade then cover and refrigerate for at least four hours. Turn the cheese over in the marinade every 40 minutes or so.
Make the salad. Peel the oranges taking care to remove all the white pith that lies under the skin. Save as much juice as you can and pour it into a bowl. Pour the marinade from the cheese into the bowl and return the cheeses to the fridge. Trim the asparagus then cut into long thin shavings using a vegetable peeler. Push the asparagus into the marinade. Trim the spinach leaves, toss them in olive oil, a little salt and pepper and divide between two plates.
Slice the blood oranges and place them in the spinach, lift the asparagus from the marinade and pile on to the plates. Place a cheese on each plate and slit it open. Spoon the marinade over the cheese and the salad.
In June 2013, a young American postgraduate called Sophie was passing through London when she called up the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.
“That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.”
Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”
Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”
On that day in June 2013, Sophie met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she suggested he meet this firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.”
Who’s her father?
“Eric Schmidt.”
Eric Schmidt – the chairman of Google?
“Yes. And she suggested Alexander should meet this company called Palantir.”
I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of eBay and PayPal, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump.
In some ways, Eric Schmidt’s daughter showing up to make an introduction to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.
It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.
There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.
Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign.
What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.
It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”.
How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.”
AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished.
There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.
Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.”
He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said.
Who’s Chris Wylie?
“He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.”
There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.”
I did find Chris Wylie. He refused to comment.
Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”.
I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.
What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.
SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.
This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”
Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.
And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.
Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.
The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.”
Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.
But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?
“It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.”
Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.
“We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.”
A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform.
David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.”
These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”.
In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?
It makes me think again about the story involving Sophie Schmidt, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.
Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.
A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.
“On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.”
In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.
The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.
Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.
The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”.
On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook.
Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”.
And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.”
The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.
But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”.
And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer.
This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.”
Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.”
Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.
“He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.”
On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.
I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.
“I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.”
It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.
And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.
For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.
Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America.
Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.”
This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn’t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics. It’s about the first step into a brave, new, increasingly undemocratic world.

Among drowned migrants belongings, Dawood found small plastic bags – not of drugs, but earth from their homelands
Tuvalu (population 11,000) and Kiribati (107,000) are low-lying archipelago nations in the Pacific acutely vulnerable to climate change, in particular to rising sea levels that have already begun inundating land and homes across the islands.
The World Bank paper argues a structured migration program instituted now would prevent a more harried, forced migration in future generations.
“The worsening impacts of climate change have provided a new moral imperative for providing open access,” the report says.
It forecasts, with open migration, about 1,300 i-Kiribati and Tuvaluans would migrate to Australia and New Zealand annually, about 0.6% of those countries’ combined annual permanent migration programs.
“The two governments would prefer a slow outward flow resulting from voluntary migration and do not wish their peoples to be treated as ‘refugees’ fleeing a hopeless economic and environmental situation.”
Seventeen people from the Pacific – including 11 from Tuvalu and five from Kiribati – have already made refugee claims in New Zealand, citing climate change as part of their basis of claim. None have been successful (four have yet to be determined and 13 have been rejected) because the refugees convention does not recognise climate change as grounds for protection.
Report author Prof Stephen Howes from the Australian National University said unrestricted access across national borders was unusual but it did occur, with some Pacific nations, such as the Federated States of Micronesia, granted open access to the US, effectively borderless travel between Australia and New Zealand, and free movement within the EU.
“But there has to be something very special, very important to allow that free movement. It seems to us that climate change might provide such unusual circumstances as to give rise to open access.”
He stressed the migration to Australia and New Zealand was not “about emptying out those countries” but with making them sustainable, economically and environmentally.
Howes said it was important to have a pathway to permanent migration for Pacific Islanders coming to Australia and New Zealand so they could form diasporas that could assist later generations of migrants.
“If you don’t have that avenue for permanent migration, you won’t establish a diaspora, and the most successful migrant communities we’ve seen, for instance, the Indian community in Australia, thrive because of the personal and community links an established diaspora provides.”
Open access migration for all Pacific Islanders has been proposed by a number of Australian thinktanks as a more effective mechanism than aid for lifting struggling Pacific states out of poverty.
Based on conservative assumptions, an uncapped migration model could increase the income of some Pacific Island countries – for the entire population, not just emigrants – by 300 to 400% over the next 25 years.
“We are conscious that this focus is a different way of thinking about development but conventional thinking is clearly not working in the Pacific.”
“The time is now ripe for Australia to reconsider how it engages with the Pacific workforce,” the Menzies report says. “Forecasts for labour demands suggest that the domestic labour supply will not be sufficient to meet demand in sectors like aged and community care, agriculture and tourism and hospitality. They are sectors with jobs that workers from the Pacific are potentially well-suited to fill.”
Launching the Menzies Research Centre report, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia had a substantial aid program in the region, focused on infrastructure, health, education, security and defence.
“But foreign aid alone will not deliver economically sustainable and independent nations,” she said. “That’s why we’re focusing on seeking to build the economies of our Pacific Island neighbours.
“Australia has some of our labour force shortages met but those from the Pacific gain skills, gain an opportunity, gain access to Australian qualifications, see Australian business practices and of course send home remittances.”
Australia’s relations with the region are expected to be a key element of the government’s forthcoming migration white paper. Australia has run a seasonal workers program since 2012 – which has attracted some criticism over worker exploitation – and, since last year, a Pacific microstates-northern Australia worker pilot, which provides multi-year visas for up to 250 workers from Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru.
Bishop’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said climate change migration was not a priority.
“Australia believes that the best response to climate change impacts, where feasible, is effective adaptation and well-supported internal relocation rather than resettlement.”
Bzzz. Bzzz. I can still remember the sound and the feeling of having my head shaved for the first time. It was a warm evening in July, I had some kind of throat infection and we were about to go on holiday. I had been dyeing my hair various colours of the rainbow since I was 12. The only options I had left were green or … shaved. I was about to start a new job and felt, for a few reasons, that I was starting again. Shaved it would be. As my hair dropped to the floor, and we went shorter and shorter with the clippers, I felt lighter, liberated, ecstatic. It sounds ridiculous, but the effect was so powerful that my tonsils, or whatever it was, stopped hurting.
I had recently stopped drinking and I wanted to cut off the past and its boozy repetitions, to shed a side of me that was dangerous and destructive. I wanted to raze myself to ground zero and build myself back up again. Shaving my head felt like the most elemental and easy way to do it. Perhaps it was also a reaction against a conception of life as a sober person. It felt like an emboldening, a taking control of my identity, something anarchic and subversive in the face of a lifetime of Diet Coke, tea and early-to-bed. It also felt a bit brave, as if by doing it I could front away the fear of life without my crutch. In those early months, I felt raw, as if my skin had been removed, and having a shaved head somehow made me feel stronger.
When you find yourself drunk all the time, or hungover, your self-esteem can take a kicking. It took time to build mine back, but having a shaved head gave me a starting point. It also affirmed in me the simple concept of growth as intrinsic to life (well, for a while), that things change and move forward. Hair grows. Patterns can be broken. Neurons adapt.
The reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Friends seemed to like it, but elderly relatives? Not so much. My mother cried the first time she saw it, because she thought I looked ill. A friend’s mother told me it looked awful and scary. My grandmother was upset because it reminded her of images of people in Nazi concentration camps. I was a lot more comfortable at a festival or in a city rather than the rural corners of Scotland or the news desk of the newspaper where I was working at the time.
It is true that, historically, a shaved head is associated with some pretty bad stuff. Deposed emperors in Byzantium would have their heads shaved, along with castration and disfigurement. The Merovingians shaved the heads of dethroned kings or failed successors. French women who slept with German soldiers in the second world war had their heads shaved and were then paraded through the streets. It has been used as a tool to shame, dehumanise and mark in different cultures. It’s not all bad, though: Grace Jones said that shaving her head led directly to her first orgasm.
I kept my head shaved for a couple of years, enjoying the ease of my husband getting his clippers out, not costing a penny, wash and go. I loved the way my scalp felt like a velvety vole. But in a way, it was high maintenance. It required makeup and a proper outfit. And growing it out was a bore.
The shadow chancellor said those most affected by income tax increases would be “the 1% at the top”, a figure that roughly equates to the proportion already on the highest, 45% rate, of income tax.
McDonnell was careful to avoid being too specific but when questioned he declined to rule out raising the top rate of tax to 50p, saying the party was still “consolidating and confirming our manifesto”.
McDonnell had hinted earlier in the weekend that those earning over £80,000 would be asked to pay a “modest” increase. This would effectively create a new tax bracket for those earning between £80,000 and £150,000.
Conservative sources responded by claiming that McDonnell backed an even higher tax rise, pointing to a 2012 blog in which he called for “the restoration of progressive income tax of 60% on incomes above £100,000”.
Those earning high salaries would benefit in other ways from Labour’s manifesto, he told the audience at the Museum of London. “I want to pay tribute to those who do pay their taxes at the high level,” he said. “They make their contribution and we thank them for that. At the same time, we want a fair taxation system. If we upgrade our economy, we will create a richer society.”
“I’m not working on wild hypotheticals,” he said. “I think we’ve got a period of time in which we’ve not been able to get our policies across. Partly that’s the media, I have to say. I have to be straight about that. But also we are campaigning with a united party, our campaign has got to step up a notch. The general election starts now.”
On the ground, local Labour activists opposed to Corbyn have been discreetly compiling data from voters on whether a change of leadership could persuade them to back the party. Activists in a number of areas where the Labour vote slipped in the local elections, including parts of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and West Midlands, have been asking voters “what could we change that would persuade you to vote Labour?” according to canvass returns seen by the Guardian.
Canvassers mark papers with a ‘J’ if voters suggest changing the leadership. Those who suggest the Labour leader is the problem will get call-backs from the local Labour MP to try to bring in personal votes.
Alan Johnson, a Labour former home secretary who is stepping down as an MP at the election, said Corbyn had shown he could deliver his message to “rallies to hundreds of supporters in safe Labour territory,” but had to expand this reach in the election. “Here’s a chance for him to do that and he has to grasp [it],” Johnson told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.
He much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches
At 67, still a man mountain at 6ft 4in, face leathery as a saddle-bag and with his latest hairpiece perfectly in place, it seemed he much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches from toffs in bowler hats and pub brawls to cars leaping across Tower Bridge.
Colourfully and unrestrainedly, it was “fucking” and “goddamn” this, or “shit” and “asshole” that as Wayne, one of Hollywood’s most vocal right-wingers, laid into everything and everyone from “whining radicals who call themselves liberals” and “theatre actors who couldn’t polish a bit player’s shoes” to “bank presidents and stock manipulators running studios who know nothing about motion pictures”.
To make that day even more memorable, his often gleefully intemperate tirades were constantly punctuated by painful throat-clearing and phlegmy hawking which, within minutes, had swiftly evolved into an ear-splitting series of wracking coughs and sonorous spitting (into a hanky).
Yet, as Wayne – who had bravely gone public with his lung cancer, coining the term “The Big C”, just a decade earlier – battled his turbulent throat on this warm day in summer, he never showed any obvious signs of weakening or remotely giving in as I offered the occasional, feeble, “It must be very unpleasant” or “Would you like me to leave?”
Someone once wrote: “Film stars don’t die in Liverpool.” Well, they certainly aren’t meant to peg out in Perivale, west London, either.
In fact, the wheezier he became, the more he seemed to warm to his harangues, which also included “today’s filmmakers who’d let all illusion go out the window”.
When, I asked, would he finally call it a day? “I’m gonna finish,” he declared in that famous drawl, “when they say: ‘Oh, do we have to look at that old sonofabitch again?’”
He died in 1979 after completing just two more pictures.

Macron supporters gathered around the famous glass pyramid, where they watched the new president-elect give his victory speech at his campaign headquarters the other side of Paris.
A few hours later, he was there in person, looking serious and presidential as he strode across the Louvre courtyard to the stage. “Macron president. Macron president,” they cheered.
“Thank you my friends,” he told them. “What we have done for the last many months has no precedent or equivalent. Everyone said it was not possible but they didn’t know France.”
It was a sombre address for a celebration party. Macron said he accepted many had voted for him even though they disagreed with his programme to “defend the republic against extremism”. “I will protect the republic,” he told the crowd.
Macron said he was aware of the “anger, anxiety and doubt” that many French citizens felt and expressed in their vote. He said he would be “implacable and entirely resolved” in defending their security. “I will defend France, its vital interests, its image,” he said.
His primary task over the coming five years, he added, was to “calm people’s fears, restore France’s confidence, and gather all its people together to face the immense challenges that face us”.
Supporters had begun gathering outside the Louvre late in the afternoon, but security checks meant many people were still outside when the result was announced. The organisers had planned for 10,000 and numbers swelled dramatically as the night drew in.
Despite the party music, live bands, DJ and dancing girls, the crowd often seemed reticent and subdued. Macron’s supporters seemed happy, emotional, but not entirely overjoyed; an atmosphere reflecting the sense that the country had sailed very close to a perilous wind and gone through an experience that had left many traumatised.
 Ben Lounis, 39, a radiologist, who was born in Algeria, had brought his three children to celebrate at the Louvre. As the children, aged between six and 10, waved flags, he said: “I am very satisfied with the result. France has avoided the worst. I feel Mr Macron is an interesting and intelligent young man and I hope he will bring lots of good things to France and the whole world.
“I hope that under him we can find ourselves in a multi-cultural France where we regard each other as human beings. I have three children of mixed race, their mother is French, we live in France and we want to keep living in France. We were afraid of the alternative.”
Kardia, a French citizen who was originally from Burkina Faso, said she was “very happy” with the result. “We need a young president who will change things. For me it’s an important win for our children. The fact he is so young does’t bother me at all. He is just what France needs. A young entrepreneur.”
She said that Le Pen’s place in the election’s second round had made her afraid. “I’ve been in France for 20 years, lived in the US, now I live in Spain. My children are studying, living and working all over the world. I don’t understand this idea of France for the French. We need to have a world view.”
A 40-33 victory for Umaga’s Blues over the NSW Waratahs in Sydney and the Chiefs’ 46-17 thrashing of the Queensland Reds in New Plymouth extended New Zealand’s collective winning streak over Australian teams in the competition to 23 matches – and 17 this season.
Only a massive upset in any of the eight remaining trans-Tasman home-and-away fixtures can deny the Kiwi dominators a 25-0 clean sweep of their Australian counterparts in 2017.
Umaga suspects the ongoing uncertainty around which Australian team will be cut from the competition in 2018 is taking its toll.
“We all know that there’s been some tough things going on over here and not just on the field, obviously off the field, so that’s unsettling,” he said after his Blues consigned the Waratahs to a fourth straight loss at Allianz Stadium for the first time since 1999.
“It’s pretty tough to keep everyone on an even keel when you’re always looking over your shoulder wondering what if and what could happen, and so that’s tough.
“There’s some quality players and staff involved in these groups and they’ll get it back on track, but I suppose what everyone’s looking for is a decision to be made so everyone can know what’s happening. That’s just how it is and we’re taking advantage of that, obviously.”
Asked how the under-performing – but safe – Waratahs and Reds could blame the Sanzaar situation for their on-field woes, Umaga said: “I’m sure they wouldn’t see that as an excuse. It’s just the lay of the land. It’s reality.
“If you talk about players and staff, and the uncertainty of it, it’s like anything; if you’re in employment and you don’t know what’s going to happen from year to year, you can’t say that it’s not unsettling.”
Australia’s struggles aren’t restricted to New Zealand rivals.
The Melbourne Rebels’ 47-10 home loss to the Lions and the Sharks’ 37-12 defeat of the Western Force in Durban leaves Australian franchises with just three wins from 31 matches against all overseas opposition this campaign.
The Kiwis also continue to rule South Africa, with the unbeaten Crusaders’ 62-24 rout of the Bulls in Pretoria completing another weekend sweep for the powerful New Zealand conference.
The Hurricanes came from behind late to see off the Stormers 41-22 in Wellington, but the titleholders’ comeback paled into comparison to the Highlanders’ against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein.
The 2015 champions trailed by 17 points before piling on three tries in the last five minutes to snatch a 45-41 victory. In the final match of round 11, the Jaguares edged the Sunwolves 46-39 in a high-scoring thriller in Buenos Aires.
Indonesian authorities have said about 200 inmates remain at large two days after a mass escape from an overcrowded prison on Sumatra island.
The breakout at Sialang Bungkuk prison in Pekanbaru on Friday occurred when prisoners were let out of their cells to perform prayers. They broke through a prison door, overwhelming the few guards on duty.
Police said 242 men had been recaptured by Sunday morning, leaving about 200 still at large.
Authorities were initially uncertain how many prisoners had escaped, estimating the numbers at between 100 and 300.
Police said some of the men surrendered or were returned by their families and others were captured by local residents, police and soldiers.
Various officials have said the prisoners were angry about poor conditions and treatment. The prison has a capacity of about 360 but was holding more than 1,870 men, according to a local police spokesman, Guntur Aryo Tejo.
Tejo said four of the escaped inmates were apprehended by police late on Friday about 60 miles from the prison, on a bus heading for West Sumatra province.
Hundreds of police and soldiers have been deployed in the hunt for the prisoners.
Friday’s escape was the biggest since July 2013 when about 240 prisoners, including several convicted terrorists, escaped after a deadly riot at a prison in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province.
The finer details of the cash offer still needed to be ironed out and approved by the local council, Galliano wrote on his Facebook page. But if all goes ahead, from next year anyone who transfers their residence to Bormida and either rents or buys a property there will be gifted €2,000.
“We’re still working out the plan, but anyone is welcome to come and live here,” said a local councillor, who asked not to be named. “We’re a small community but very welcoming. We’re high up in a mountain area but also not far from the sea – it’s a healthy lifestyle, the air is very clean.”
But what is life like in Bormida? The manager of Oddone Giuseppe, one of the town’s four restaurants, said: “There is nothing much to do here. But life is so simple and natural, we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food. Life would definitely be free of stress.”
A report last year by Legambiente, an Italian environmental association, found that 2,500 villages across the country risked being abandoned owing to depopulation.
In January the culture ministry named 2017 the “year of the village” as part of an attempt to promote tourism in places at risk of becoming deserted.
What a difference a week makes. Xhaka felt the same injury here and he was removed from the fray in the 76th minute. This time Arsenal were 2-0 up and coasting towards victory in a game they had to win.
Xhaka departed to a rousing ovation. He had made the difference, turning the afternoon in his team’s favour with a deflected pot-shot, and no one could say the break was not overdue for Xhaka, who has endured a difficult first season in England after his big-money move from Borussia Mönchengladbach, or his club.
Arsenal were up and running, their early nerves a distant memory, and when the former United striker Danny Welbeck rose to head home Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain’s cross, after Anthony Martial had been robbed by Rob Holding, the die was cast. United had offered little in an attacking sense and, when they were asked to respond, it was no surprise they could not.
At the 16th time of asking Arsène Wenger could celebrate victory in a competitive match against a José Mourinho team. Arsenal will need a favour from elsewhere if they are to finish a difficult season in a Champions League position but at least they are still fighting.
As for United, this was the limpest of defeats and Mourinho’s post-match press conference, when he wrote off his team’s top-four chances and had a pop at Wenger for pressuring the fourth official, was much more entertaining than what his players served up on the pitch.
Yes, they had two clear first-half chances, which Martial and Wayne Rooney could not take; Rooney’s opportunity was presented to him by an errant Holding back-pass rather than any creativity on United’s part. Petr Cech stood tall on both occasions. But Mourinho’s post‑match performance should not be allowed to obscure his team’s failings.
Opportunity had knocked loudly for them after Liverpool’s home draw against Southampton earlier in the day. Once again United had control of their destiny in terms of the fight for a Champions League finish via the league. They surrendered it and a single statistic continues to damn them. They have not scored a single goal away from home against a top-six club this season – and that includes the 1-0 FA Cup defeat against Chelsea.
They do retain a shot at next season’s Champions League via the Europa League, where they are 1-0 up against Celta Vigo after the first leg of the semi‑final. Win that competition, return to the Champions League and, with the EFL Cup in the bag, the season is a success. Yet it is plain Mourinho has much work to do and what was remarkable about this defeat which ended United’s 25-match unbeaten run in the league was how meek the manager was about it.
United have been described as injury-ravaged but Mourinho was without only five players because of various ailments – Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. A sixth, Marouane Fellaini, was suspended.
Mourinho’s starting lineup was strong despite the eight changes he made from the first leg in Vigo last Thursday, although he was worried about how Phil Jones and Juan Mata would cope with their first football since late March. The same went for Chris Smalling, who had returned from a similar lay-off as a late substitute against Vigo.
Mourinho, though, would labour the point about how fatigued his squad are, having played three times each week since the beginning of April and certainly there was precious little spark about them.
Arsenal pressed on to the front foot, with United happy to attempt to counter-attack, and the home team had their chances in the first half. Aaron Ramsey drew a fine save out of De Gea from Alexis Sánchez’s through-ball; Welbeck was denied by a desperate Jones block following a corner; and Oxlade-Chamberlain tested De Gea with a deflected blast.
Mourinho had clashed with Wenger midway through the first half after the Arsenal manager complained to the fourth official about a tackle from Rooney on Oxlade-Chamberlain. The home crowd stirred but they truly crackled to life on the one-two punch from Xhaka and Welbeck. Rooney had a couple of efforts towards the end but United could have played on and on and not scored.
Some of it is art. But fundamentally, I entertain
Mulling this over, I get the nod that Scott is ready for me. Walking into the suite, I find him rearranging the furniture. “I can’t have those soft chairs,” he explains, his accent a bit Stockton, a bit Hollywood. “They’re no good for my back.” If, as Alan Parker suggests, you are struggling to place the face, Scott has something of the Bryan Cranston about him. His hair, once rusty red, is gradually turning metallic silver, his moustache holding out longest. He’s 5ft 7in, give or take, and is dressed today in his standard film-set attire: black fleece jacket and sensible shoes.
Why, I wonder aloud, don’t we see more of Scott? He looks perplexed by the inquiry, perhaps understandably, but answers gnomically: “I do enough.”
And, in a way, I’ve got my answer as to why Scott makes his films and then keeps his head down.
The script that Scott read had an all-male crew, but there was a change of heart at 20th Century Fox and two of the characters were switched to women, including Ellen Ripley, the last surviving member of the ship. “I cast Ripley really late,” says Scott. “Two weeks out, we still hadn’t found her. Then somebody came up, I think it was Warren Beatty, and said, ‘There’s this woman, on off-Broadway, on the theatre boards called Sigourney Weaver, you should meet with her. Interesting.’ So I called her, went to New York, she walks in, she must have been 6ft 6in, with an afro, so she’s 7ft 2in. And I was like a midget, and I had dinner with her. That was it!”
Neither Scott nor Weaver, apparently, realised it, but Ripley would become an iconic heroine. “It hadn’t dawned on me,” admits Scott. “After the event, I went, ‘Oh, OK, yeah, absolutely,’ but I never thought about that.”
Being in Berlin seems to have put Scott in a reflective mood and, without much prompting, he starts to talk about his childhood. His father Francis was a colonel in the Royal Engineers and the family spent five years in West Germany after the war as part of the Marshall plan. They lived in a house so grand it had a library and Scott went to boarding school in Wilhelmshaven, where he used to watch U-boats in the North Sea: “I loved it.” Francis was offered the prestigious position of head of port authority for the Elbe, based in Hamburg, but Scott’s mother wanted to return home to be near her relatives. Scott smiles, “I remember saying, at eight-and-a-half: ‘Take the job. You’re making the wrong decision.’ But it wasn’t to be, and we went back to Stockton-on-Tees and ended up on a council estate.
“My dad was a great guy, he did the right thing for the family, but he was not a happy man for the rest of his life,” Scott goes on. “And the interesting thing is that nobody said anything. We just looked at the house, pebble dash, move in and that’s it, dude. You’d get on with it.”
Back in the north-east, Scott went to a secondary modern school. He struggled academically; only later did he think that he might be slightly dyslexic. “After being bottom for five years, I decided that I wasn’t academically sound – for anything, truly. And I was really trying. I wasn’t lazy. I just couldn’t retain anything that I wasn’t interested in. If I’m interested, I’ve got a photographic brain. I could walk out of this room and in a year, I could draw it right down to the paintings on the wall.”
Tony Scott killed himself in 2012, jumping from a suspension bridge in Los Angeles. Ridley later revealed that Tony had cancer. “Being an elder brother, if ever there was an argument about anything, I’d back off, always,” says Scott now. “Nothing’s worth losing a relationship over. So I’d always back down, say, ‘OK, then.’” He laughs affectionately, “He was like the spoiled brat really.
Family is Scott’s one great concern outside of films – his other big passion in life was tennis, which he played very competitively, always singles, well into his 70s, until he blew his knees. He is married to the Costa Rican actor Giannina Facio, his third wife, and they move between houses in Los Angeles, London and the Luberon in Provence. He has three grown-up children – Jake, Luke and Jordan – all of whom have followed him into the business, either in films or advertising. It is little surprise then that Scott has felt the loss of his brother keenly. He often called Tony the one person in Hollywood he could trust – and he still thinks of him every time he finishes a project.
“They are quite different as people, but they are both very smart. You better do your homework. Or you better have your point of view, because if you don’t, they’re going to stomp on you. When they say, ‘Why would I do that?’ you better have a bloody good answer.”
“It all comes full circle to starting out as a painter. You walk in the room in the morning, where you spent all day yesterday by yourself. You stare at the canvas and you go: ‘Bloody hell, I hate it.’ Painting is all about what you did yesterday, how you’re going to recorrect it, improve it, or go: ‘Holy shit, I got it.’” He pauses, perhaps remembering Pauline Kael and her real or imagined slights against his beard. “It’s being your own critic, that’s it. That’s the most important thing.”
Scott is well known for his time-keeping and, today, ours is up. After the current round of press requirements, he will again disappear. Back to his films, until the next time. It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy the attention, he just doesn’t need it. “Thanks,” he says, as I get up to leave, “but you know I won’t read it, don’t you?”
Alien: Covenant is out on 12 May
Muttonbird, sea plants and eel spines: these native New Zealand ingredients may no longer be components of many diets, but one woman and her cafe are trying to change that.
Jade Temepara, who is of Maori descent, set up Kākano just over a year ago in Christchurch. “Maori people are the unhealthiest, most unfit and most likely to have heart disease – and it’s because of our lifestyle,” says Jade. “Our cause is to bring our traditional food back, and to involve Maori people in the preparation.”
Part cafe, part social enterprise, Kākano was built with the help of the local homeless community on the site of the city’s old convention centre, which was destroyed by the 2011 earthquake. If you walked past it, you’d be forgiven for not noticing the low-rise Portakabin-style building, hidden behind rows of raised garden beds, which are planted with local herbs and vegetables. But it’s more spacious than it appears from the outside, seating 25 (there are an additional 40 seats out on the deck), and though decoration is minimal, the monochrome colour scheme, black and white photos and select few New Zealand handicrafts on display elevate the space.
The whole setup has a distinctly temporary feel, and that’s not by accident: it’s all designed to be “lift and shift”, and in June will be transported from this provisional site to a permanent location just around the corner.
Over the past year, Kākano has built up a strong following among locals, both Maori and non-, and also attracts tourists who, Jade says, “love our story”. Community classes held here – which teach adults and children how to grow and prepare their own food, from fermenting cabbage to gutting fish – always sell out.
Within minutes of arriving to collect my professionally bound thesis, I found myself on the receiving end of an unsolicited and impenetrable rant about female genital mutilation.
“What’s your paper on?” the shop owner inquired.
“It’s on Muslim women and … ,” I began, but before I could finish my sentence, he had launched into the subject.
The fact that I hadn’t even mentioned the words “female genital mutilation” was irrelevant; merely saying “Muslim women” was a wide enough rabbit hole for him to dart down. My presence as a Muslim woman and my half-delivered topic were the only encouragement he needed.
It’s uncanny how often people try to demonstrate their concern about the alleged oppression of Muslim women by humiliating them. Even finding out the details of my research findings doesn’t seem to deter them from baldly sharing opinions.
I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about 'Islam’s treatment of women' countless times
When I was neck-deep in my doctoral research, I attended a black-tie journalism-industry dinner on a windy Sydney night. Some of Australia’s most intelligent and perceptive thinkers were in the well-dressed crowd. I had grown accustomed to answering questions about my subject. I had also grown quite used to the standard responses I received to my thesis, and habitually gave ambiguous answers to avoid them.
A well-known and popular journalist approached me and asked what I did for living. His reaction, despite belonging to a group of people usually known for their cognitive skills, was so representative that I scribbled it down on a dinner napkin as soon as he left so I would not forget a word:
Journalist: So what do you do?
Me: I’m completing my PhD.
Journalist: On?
Me: (purposefully vague) Sociology and politics.
Journalist: But what is your exact research question?
Me: (inward sigh at what was inevitably to follow, but valiantly indifferent exterior) I’m investigating the way Muslim women fight sexism within Muslim communities.
Journalist: (with widened, alarmed eyes) That’s dangerous waters!
Me: (through gritted teeth) Not really. It’s been going on for many hundreds of years, and I’ve been spoiled for choice with the number of women who have been willing to be participants in my research.
Journalist: Did they want it known what they were doing? Or did they need it kept secret?
Me: (icy frustration descends into Arctic winter) Oh, many of them were happy to be identified in my research. In fact, some were angry when I suggested giving them a pseudonym, insisting they wanted to be known for this work.
Journalist: (now completely flabbergasted) But … but, did their husbands know of their apostasy?!
Me: (choosing to ignore use of “apostasy” as eyes take on glacial sheen) Actually, many of the women listed their husbands, or another Muslim man – like their father or imam – as their greatest supporters.
Journalist: (now quite literally speechless) …
I’ve had similar exchanges — too many to count — with non-Muslims over the course of my research. Commonplace is the firm conviction that sexism against Muslim women is rife, most often coupled with the utter disbelief that women who challenge sexism could exist, let alone that there are many of them, that they are not a new phenomenon, and that Muslim men often support them in their efforts. I often wonder how people can be so comfortable presenting these attitudes directly to me, a clearly identifiable Muslim woman in a hijab. They do not appear at all uneasy in making it apparent just how bad they think life is for any and all Muslim women, and how unengaged they believe Muslim women to be in confronting the sexism they invariably face.
I have received similar, but different, reactions within some sections of various Muslim communities when they found out the focus of my research. Often I would be purposefully vague when discussing my topic with them, too. I would restrict myself to saying that I was researching “Muslim women”, and avoid highlighting the “fighting sexism” part, as there is a complicated, often suspicious attitude towards anything that may be perceived as “feminism” within Muslim communities. Or I would rush to reassure them that I was not framing this in an anti-religious perspective.
Their scepticism is perhaps an understandable reaction from a minority community that frequently feels under siege, particularly when it comes to women’s rights. I hoped the fact that my research was being carried out from within a common faith, and that it drew explicitly and deeply on the theological resources afforded by this, reassured them that I, unlike many others, was not engaging in an attack on the faith and communities they held dear.
But still certain people within the Muslim community were scornful, rolling their eyes and calling me a feminist — not as a compliment, but a warning. They saw feminism and Islam as inherently at odds.
This is the terrain in which my research into Muslim women occurred. The subject is fraught on multiple fronts; the topic of “Muslim women and sexism” is a minefield of unflappable certainty and indignation from all corners. Yet for something about which so many people are adamantly sure, I feel there is very little information from the women actually involved. It seems to me that, in the argument in which Muslim women are the battlefield, the war rages on and the angry accusations zing past their heads from all sides. The main casualty is, ironically, women’s self-determination.
Islam is arguably the most discussed religion in the west today, in both media and society, and, after terrorism, the plight of Muslim women is probably the most controversial topic of debate. I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about “Islam’s treatment of women” countless times in person and online. Nonetheless, there is only a small amount of published work available on the topic of Muslim women fighting sexism within Muslim communities, and much of that focuses on women who see Islam as inherently part of the problem — if not the whole problem — that Muslim women face.
The assumption is that Muslim women need to be extricated from the religion entirely before anything close to liberation or equality can be achieved.
There are limited sociological accounts of Muslim women who fight sexism from a faith-positive perspective, and only a handful of studies that investigate the theological works of some Muslim feminists. The responses to, and motivations of, these women are dealt with coincidentally, as opposed to primarily. This small pool of available resources clashes with what I know anecdotally to be happening in many Muslim communities, as well as the historical accounts of Muslim women who, from the earliest days of Islam, have been challenging the sexism they have experienced by using religious arguments.
For years now I have been speaking about issues relating to Islam, Muslims and gender to the media, both Australian and overseas. In one sense I choose this, but in another it has been chosen for me, moulded by the way others attempt to define and restrict me, more or less obliging me to respond.
It’s a common story. Jasmin Zine, a Canadian scholar, once observed that not just our actions but also our very identities are constantly being shaped by dual, competing discourses that surround us. There’s the fundamentalist, patriarchal narrative, persistently trying to confine the social and public lives of Muslim women in line with the kind of narrow, gendered parameters that are by now so familiar. But there are also some western feminist discourses that seek to define our identities in ways that are quite neocolonial: backward, oppressed, with no hope of liberation other than to emulate whatever western notions of womanhood are on offer. This wedging chimes with my experience, and it’s a problem because, as Zine argues, both arms deny Muslim women the ability — indeed the right — to define our identities for ourselves, and especially to do so within the vast possibilities of Islam.
It is as though male Muslim scholars and non-Muslim western feminists have handed down predetermined scripts for us to live by. And it is left to those people thought not to exist — Muslim women who fight sexism — to rewrite those scenarios and reclaim our identities.
 Last month, a Pentagon spokesman said Hasib had probably been killed during the raid on 27 April by US and Afghan special forces in Nangarhar during which two US army Rangers were killed. But prior to Sunday’s announcement there had been no confirmation.
 The statement, following an earlier announcement by Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, said Hasib directed the 8 March attack on the main Kabul military hospital by a group of militants disguised as doctors. Dozens of medical staff and patients were killed in the attack.
 It said he also ordered fighters to behead local elders in front of their families and kidnap women and girls to force them to marry Isis fighters.
 The local affiliate of Islamic State, sometimes known as Islamic State Khorasan (Isis-K), after an old name for the region that includes Afghanistan, has been active since 2015, fighting both the Taliban as well as Afghan and US forces.
 It is believed to maintain links with the main Islamic State movement in Iraq and Syria but has considerable operational independence.
 US and Afghan special forces, backed by drone strikes and other air support, have waged a series of operations against Isis-K since March, killing dozens of their fighters, mainly in Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan.
 The US military statement said that in addition to claiming the life of Hasib, 35 Islamic State fighters and several high ranking commanders were also killed in the 27 April raid.
 Hundreds of fighters had been killed or captured this year and the offensive was continuing, with over half the districts controlled by Isis-K retaken, allowing residents in some places to return for the first time in two years.
What is it about Italian coaches? Certainly, Serie A offers them the comprehensive grounding. Paul Pogba, the Manchester United midfielder, who spent four seasons at Juventus, described Italy’s top division as “the university of football, especially at a tactical level”. Then, there is Coverciano, the Italian Football Federation’s acclaimed technical centre and finishing school for managers.
“There is a good school in Italy but, honestly, when you arrive in England and you face this league, you must change your mind on a lot of things,” Conte says. “You must adapt very well and very quickly to this league. It is very difficult, very strong and it’s totally different to the Italian or Spanish leagues.
“In every single game, you must fight a lot. You must put all of yourself into every game and if you think you’re playing a team at a medium level you’re actually preparing for a defeat. For this reason it’s not easy [for an English team] to reach the end of a European competition. Also, for the national team, it’s very difficult to do very well in the World Cup or the Euros because you arrive at the end of the season and the players are tired.”
That is for the summer. For now, Conte is consumed by Middlesbrough and the final title push. It stands to lead him into elite company. “For sure, I looked at the past in England and I saw many Italian managers had won the title,” he says. “It’s great for our school and it’s logical to be proud, no? Last season, I supported Claudio Ranieri a lot to win the title and in Italy we celebrated this win in a great way.”
Cleaning up all that was straightforward: turn the machine down to 30C and use an eco detergent.
In terms of plastic fibre volume, a city the size of Berlin may be responsible for releasing the equivalent of 540,000 plastic bags’ worth of them into the ocean daily.
That sounds overwhelming, but the more natural fibres you wear (such as cotton), the better. Frequently washed items should be non-synthetic where possible.
With the rise of the clean beauty movement it can be difficult navigating the plethora of products out there that claim to be natural and organic.
Green People, celebrating 20 years in the business, is the real deal. This is the brand that defined what it means to be organic.
Back in 1999, founder Charlotte Vøhtz, was invited to be on a committee for the Soil Association (the UK body with the most stringent organic certification) to design the first standards for organic beauty.
Vøhtz’s drive to create her truly organic skincare range began when her young daughter Sandra was battling multiple skin allergies and eczema. Now her brand offers 160 sustainable skin and hair products (including two special anniversary ranges), but nothing that has been diluted or bulked out with high levels of water, drying alcohol or synthetic fillers.
When we say “addict”, we rarely think of people aged over 65. You might think this is uncommon. It isn’t. People expect to live longer, so they’re not slowing down just because they’re in their 60s. It shouldn’t be a surprise that we are seeing substance misuse, dependence and addiction in older people: think how many old fashioneds Don Draper got through in each episode.
We are woefully unprepared to meet the needs of older people struggling with substance misuse. So what will happen in 2030, when members of Generation X – the twentysomethings who popped pills at warehouse raves in the 1990s – start to turn 65? Addiction in older age is not a problem that’s going to go away. By 2030, nearly a quarter of the population in England will be over 65. That’s around 12 million people. We’re sitting on a ticking time bomb, waiting for the inevitable fallout of each generation overindulging in its substance of choice.
Lifetime use of cannabis and cocaine in 65- to 74-year-olds increased seven-fold and five-fold respectively between 2000 and 2014. In the last 10 years, the number of people in that age group admitted to hospital for drug-related mental health problems, such as psychosis, rose from 181 to 1,345. Use of prescription drugs for pleasure is also on the rise in older people, with opiates and medication for insomnia often used for non-medical reasons. As addiction services are being dismantled, more baby boomers with illicit drug misuse are entering old-age psychiatry services. Snorting cocaine, smoking cannabis or experimenting with psychoactive substances shouldn’t raise the eyebrows of psychiatrists providing care in older people’s mental health services, but even I initially failed my MRCPsych exams for lacking the necessary expertise on substance misuse. I didn’t realise how central it was to old-age psychiatry.
We wrongly assume that substance misuse is a younger person’s problem and there are huge challenges in increasing access to services for older people because of this.
When they do, they need care that not only addresses misuse, but takes into account chronic physical health problems and mental health conditions such as dementia. Treatment also has to manage the normal physical pain of ageing and the unfortunate truth of social isolation and bereavement.
Sadly, I see a future in which poly-substance misuse in older people is common. We have a lot of catching up to do to provide services for substance abuse beyond alcohol and tobacco. Baby boomers are the generation that laughed off inebriation, saw alcohol advertised daily on television and thought relaxation was more about smoking a joint than mindfulness.
But at what age do we assume people “grow out” of the pub night three times a week or smoking cannabis? The “you’re only young once” approach can easily go from a relaxed attitude in middle age to dependence and addiction in older life.
Substance misuse in the over-65s may seem strange because we characterise older people as fusty, but it’s not surprising that the attitudes of youth carry into later life. If we continue to ignore substance misuse in people over 65, we are closing the door on ensuring their quality of life as 70, 80 or 90-year-olds. In 2017, that door is still barely ajar.

Politics is hardly at its best right now, and that is perhaps the greatest challenge facing us. The weakness of politics undermines democracy – the faith behind politics. But democracy is crucial because climate change is also about justice: how to distribute the costs of decarbonisation and the transition to renewable energy fairly among rich and poor, developed and developing, large and small, north and south.
The best-case scenario for what is likely to be done through nation-based environmental programmes hardly dents the worst-case scenario for the catastrophic consequences of all that is not being done.
However, there is an ample menu of sustainable options available to cities wishing to address climate change aggressively – and they can amplify their impact by coordinating their policies. The list includes divestment of public funds from carbon energy companies; investment to encourage renewable energy and green infrastructure; municipal carbon taxes; fracking and drilling bans; new waste incineration technologies; regulation of the use of plastic bottles and bags; policies to improve public transport and reduce car use; and recycling.
Such approaches can be undertaken to great effect one city at a time, but they are also mutually reinforcing: networks of collaborating cities can amplify their global impact. They can also make it more difficult for courts or governments to oppose environmental initiatives, standing firm on common approaches to sustainability and decarbonisation.
There are two formidable obstacles blocking a larger role for cities: a paucity of resources and the absence of autonomy and jurisdiction. The European Union favours regions over cities, and works more on agricultural subsidies than affordable urban housing. In the United States, the structure of congressional representation means a suburban and rural minority rules over the urban majority.
Because urban citizens are the planet’s majority, their natural rights are endowed with democratic urgency. They carry the noble name of “citizen”, associated with the word “city”. But the aim is not to set urban against rural: it is to restore a more judicious balance between them. Today it is cities that look forward, speaking to global common goods, while fearful nations look back.
The world is getting too hot. Science makes it clear that sustainability is both necessary and possible. Politics shows it is achievable. Cities are poised to make it happen.
Three Australian swimmers are facing two-year bans from all competitions for missing three drugs tests over a period of 12 months.
“Swimming Australia confirms it has recently been informed by Asada and Fina that members of the Australian Dolphins Swim team may have failed to update their whereabouts appropriately over the previous 12-month period,” the Australian team said in a statement on Sunday.
All athletes in registered drug testing pools of international federations and national anti-doping organisations are required to provide their whereabouts for one hour every day (between 5am-11pm) when they will be available for testing. Asada said that at the point of each missed test, athletes have the opportunity to put forward an explanation before a missed test declaration was made.
Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson said he would be disappointed if protocols weren’t followed by the swimmers. “Both Swimming Australia and our athletes have been very clear on our position in relation to anti-doping both here in Australia and internationally,” Anderson said in a statement. 
“The Australian Dolphins Swim Team has worked hard to develop a culture of professionalism and respect. Part of that professionalism is ensuring each athlete is accountable and responsible for accurately providing their locations so testers can access them when required. It is extremely disappointing if this has not occurred as it should.”
Why not rig the system instead of letting the system rig us? I do not believe ballot manipulation can work. The Progressive Alliance ducks hard questions about what it means to be a “progressive” and does not think hard enough about whether this woozy label can unite a winning coalition. But the times are dark and are about to get darker. I have no right to dismiss new ideas without explaining them first
The “Blairite” Peter Kyle holds it with a tiny majority over the Tories (He’s a “Blairite” in the sense that everyone who does not worship at the Church of Jeremy the Martyr is a Blairite.) The Greens have not stepped aside here. They want Labour to give them the Isle of Wight before they make any more concessions.
If Labour wins Brighton Kemptown, Ealing Central, where the Greens have also withdrawn, and in as yet unnamed seats where the Progressive Alliance assures me deals are coming, it will show that the anti-Tory left can break out of the straitjacket first past the post imposes on Britain. The 2017 election will thus be the moment when an idea discussed at ill-attended conferences over cups of weak coffee has its rendezvous with reality.
I was impressed by the moral seriousness of Lucas’s Green activists I met in Brighton. Unlike Labour’s leaders, who are solely concerned with keeping control of their party, they understood the urgency of now. They know the Tories will take every seat they win as a mandate for a hard Brexit, for an impoverished NHS and for redrawing constituency boundaries in their favour. “We’re fighting the 2022 general election as well,” one told me. So we are and maybe the 2027 election, too. It took 14 years for Labour to overcome the Tory landslide of 1983. It took 13 years for the Tories to overcome the Labour landslide of 1997. You don’t just push landslides back up the hill.
For all that, progressivism is a feeble and thoughtless concept. It is apparently “progressive” to vote for the SNP. That they are nationalists who want to build borders between people, rather than tear them down, is irrelevant. The SNP is anti-Tory and that is all that matters. The Progressive Alliance adds that it is “progressive” to vote for Labour MPs who have given up on Europe and leaves the implication hanging that it is reactionary to vote against them and in favour of a decent deal with Europe.
If you want to see the weaknesses in the notion that what unites progressives is greater than what divides them at their starkest, come to Brighton. A believer in progressivism might imagine that Corbyn’s supporters would be pouring into Hove to defend Peter Kyle. They won’t, because they loathe him. Like the Labour leadership nationally, their aim is to purge Labour of all who disagree with them, not fight the Conservative party, whose electoral interests they serve with such puppy-like loyalty. Brighton shows Labour can’t form a progressive alliance with other parties because it can’t even form an alliance with itself.
Kyle goes further. He does not believe that voters in the 21st century will respond well to top-down politicians cutting deals on who should be on their ballot papers. He should persuade Greens to vote for him, he says, not restrict their choice.
He may be wrong. The Progressive Alliance may deliver Brighton Kemptown to Labour and we will have a new model to follow. I do not believe it for a moment. I believe that these manoeuvres are diversions from the hard job of building an opposition that can win. I could spend the rest of the day listing its political priorities: it will need to be patriotic, it will need to find a way of rebuilding our relations with Europe, it will need to think occasionally about creating wealth as well as spending it.
A change of culture is as important. To put it bluntly, “progressive” politics must stop being such a bellowing, joyless, finger-wagging movement. The foul sectarianism and the wholly unearned assumption of moral superiority, which has characterised the Corbyn years, has to give way to a culture that is more tolerant and less willing to take offence.
Self-criticism is not usually associated with strength. But here is a paradox. Only when “progressives” recognise their weaknesses will a rampant and rampaging right begin to fear them.
“Rock music is a belief system, in a way, and Brian Epstein dedicated everything to the Beatles and to their success. His main concern was their well-being,” said Deller. “In terms of its characters and stories, the way we feel about rock’n’roll music since the Beatles is like religion, or at least an alternative belief system.”
“I am taking a straightforward visual approach to marking the album,” said Deller, who last summer collaborated with the National Theatre’s artistic director Rufus Norris to arrange for hundreds of volunteers to appear across the country dressed as first world war soldiers. “Epstein is someone I have been thinking about for a long time. Without his contribution and sacrifice, the Beatles would not exist as we know them and a lot that we take for granted in our culture would not exist either.”
“Epstein was the band’s friend and helped them more than a little bit,” said Deller. “He was one of a handful of people they could trust.”
The introduction to the book began: “Brian Epstein’s contribution to popular culture is so immense that it is almost too large to comprehend. This might explain why he has been largley written out of the narrative of British popular culture.”
Deller concedes that Epstein is now remembered in the name of a Liverpool theatre, but argues that the Beatles’ manager has not been recognised for the sort of “ultimate sacrifice” that was, at least metaphorically, equivalent to martyrdom.
Epstein came across the band at the Cavern Club in November 1961 and shepherded their early careers. A gay man, he was forced by the laws of the time to keep his private life secret. He was found dead in his bedroom on 27 August 1967, having overdosed on sleeping pills. Homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales a month after his death.
The surviving Beatles, McCartney and Starr, are also to release an anniversary edition package on 26 May, including a new mix of the album by Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin, and Sam Okell that will feature 34 previously unreleased recordings.
Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.

Meanwhile, almost 30 employers, including PwC, the Metropolitan police and the London fire brigade, have signed up to a campaign aimed at helping staff with the cost of renting in London. Many are offering loans to cover the cost of deposits, which now average £1,756 in the capital, according to the Deposit Protection Service. Others are finding different ways to give staff a helping hand, ranging from a couple of weeks of free rent to preferential mortgage rates for those trying to buy.
However, it appears companies in other sectors are coming to realise that they also need to play their part in tackling the housing crisis. Employers in London and the south-east are increasingly complaining that soaring house prices and rents are making it difficult to recruit and keep hold of talented staff, with younger people in particular being priced out.
With this in mind, the Book Trade Charity recently merged with an organisation that has more than 20 flats in Whetstone in the London borough of Barnet, and earlier this year Hachette made a donation that will help fund the complete refurbishment of a block of six flats. This work is due to be finished by September, which is when the first wave of successful applicants for the company’s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) trainee programme are due to begin their 12-month paid internships. These trainees – and potentially other applicants – will be offered the chance to live in one of the furnished flats. Hachette did not wish to disclose the rent, but says it is “considerably below” market value (a one-bed flat in the N20 postcode is around £242 a week).
The company says the trainees will be offered the accommodation for six months, though adds: “I am sure we will review the arrangement in each case, and it may be that if there is room and someone wants to stay, then they can. But the point of the scheme is to get people started, and we will want to help as many as we can to find their feet … If we have more flats than we have trainees, we would offer it more widely.”
The trainees, who will be paid what is described as an “entry-level” salary, will be commuting to the company’s base in Blackfriars in central London. This shouldn’t be a problem as trains from New Southgate (a 15-minute walk away) take 25 minutes to get to Moorgate, and there are also Northern and Piccadilly line tube stations about 15 minutes’ walk away.
The point of the scheme is to get people started, and we will want to help as many as we can to find their feet
Last month Penguin Random House announced its own link-up with the Book Trade Charity, which is based near Kings Langley in Hertfordshire and operates a number of properties that mainly cater for older people who used to work in the industry. London-based Penguin offers 450 work experience placements every year, which typically run for two weeks, and says it wanted to do something to help those young people coming from outside the capital who might otherwise have difficulty finding somewhere to stay.
In return for a donation to the charity, the company is taking on one of the recently refurbished bungalows at the site for an initial six months, and will then nominate the people who will take turns renting it for two-week periods. They will pay what is described as “a very, very subsidised rent”, and trains from nearby Kings Langley to London Euston take 25 minutes. Penguin also stresses that all those on its work experience programme will receive a salary of £262.50 a week.
Spool back 100 years or more and philanthropic Victorian businessmen such as George Cadbury were busy creating “model villages” and estates for their employees that remain thriving communities today.
The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Hak Song had worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before he was held on Saturday.
“A relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes,” the KCNA said.
Kim Sang Duk was arrested at the Pyongyang International Airport on 22 April, the KCNA said. It said he was “intercepted for committing criminal acts” to overthrow the North’s government, but didn’t elaborate.
On Sunday, the KCNA did not say whether the two cases were connected.
In Washington, the state department said it was aware of the report of the new detention and that “the security of US citizens is one of the department’s highest priorities”.
Kim Hak Song and Kim Sang Duk are among at least four Americans being detained in North Korea, as tensions between the two countries continue.
The others are Otto Warmbier, who is serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor for alleged anti-state acts, and Kim Dong Chul, serving a 10-year term with hard labor for alleged espionage.
Washington, Seoul and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, which in recent years have involved high-profile American missions sent to secure releases.
When an American citizen is reported detained, the US works with the Swedish embassy in the North Korean capital, since the US and the North do not have diplomatic relations.
The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is the only privately funded university in North Korea and is unique for having a large number of foreign staff.
Similarly, what does the supreme leader mean by “community”? It appears more than 80 times in his message, so it must be important. Close reading suggests that Zuckerberg hasn’t the faintest idea of what a real community is: a social group comprising people who don’t agree on everything (think of an English village) but who have devised ways of getting along and doing what needs to be collectively done.
“The reason the idea – that community-building on a planetary scale is practicable, necessary and altogether good – did not seem ‘controversial’ in the beginning was,” observes Carr, “that Zuckerberg, like Silicon Valley in general, operated in a technological bubble, outside of politics, outside of history. Now that history has broken through the bubble and upset the algorithms, history must be put back in its place. Technological determinism must again be made synonymous with historical determinism.”
Carr is right. The best reason for reading the Zuckerberg epistle in full is that it provides the best illustration we have of the degree to which Silicon Valley has become detached from reality. En passant, it also shows how someone can be both staggeringly clever and also astonishingly naive. Facebook’s supreme leader is not an evil person. He just knows little about the world that actual human beings inhabit.
There is also, I am sorry to say, a less charitable explanation. It is that he has concluded that what is wrong with the world – all the fanaticism, cruelty, warfare, myopia and xenophobia – is because some parts of the world are not yet on Facebook. If only they were all part of that mythical “global community” then everything would be OK.
Macron’s triumph gives liberalism a good name. Its rehabilitation comes in the nick of time.
For months, establishment politicians have skulked in Europe’s corridors of power, listening to a growing populist clamour from without.
Like a modern-day mob raging at the gates of Versailles, neo-fascists, racists, ultra-nationalists and hard-left utopians laid siege to the self-appointed heirs of the Enlightenment.
But these would-be revolutionary forces were not confined to the political fringe.
The status quo had failed them. In working class heartlands, old loyalties broke and shattered. Their fury spilled over. They demanded change.
Analysts predicted an end to the postwar social democratic order and a return to the age of the autocrat. In the US, Trump’s supporters hailed a “historic” watershed moment.
In elections elsewhere, such as the Netherlands, extremists of left and right have also been rebuffed. Macron’s new ascendancy could re-energise the similarly youthful Matteo Renzi, a like-minded reformer now back in charge of Italy’s ruling Democratic party.
If Macron can turn ideas into facts, he will find more willing emulators in Spain, Greece and other European countries whose discredited political systems, like France’s, have seized up like old gearboxes starved of oil.
How Macron deals with Trump will be a telling test. But even Trump is not proving to be quite the nightmare that had kept many Europeans awake at night. His bark, at least so far, has been worse than his bite.
The Nato alliance has been rebooted, not retired. Russia’s Vladimir Putin has not suddenly been excused his misdeeds in Ukraine and Syria – or claims of serial election hacking.
Like Putin, Le Pen is a Trump soulmate – but a soulmate without power who missed her moment. If he has any sense at all, Trump will catch Europe’s shifting winds.
Given the alternative, maybe Macron’s win is no great surprise. Generally speaking the French have always seen themselves as a race apart. “Vive la difference” is no idle national slogan.
And while France’s open society traditionally tolerates political extremes, the mass of French voters, however angry and alienated, were never going to thoughtlessly follow in the path of Britain’s self-harming Brexiters or Trump’s blue-collar battalions.
But Berisha’s brilliance – and James Troisi’s extra-time volley that struck a post – could not prevent Sydney’s third A-League title, secured in a mostly jubilant, but uniformly breathless, arena that had witnessed fireworks – both metaphorical and literal – from start to finish. It also went some way to eliminate painful memories of the last time these two sides met in a grand final, two years ago in Melbourne, although Graham Arnold would rather have won in different circumstances.
“I’ve been through that [a grand final penalty shootout] before,” the Sydney coach said. “It’s not the greatest way to win or lose. But that’s the way it is. I thought it was a real cup final. It was a very physical game, a lot of free-kicks, a lot of fouls, a lot of passion.”
Indeed, it was far from a classic encounter between these two old rivals but what it lacked in class and guile was made up for in brawn and, by the end of the night, pure drama. From the first whistle, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque set the tone, leaving a high foot in on eventual Joe Marston medal recipient Daniel Georgievski’s thigh and what ensued during a niggly, and at times spiteful, game should have come as no surprise.
Referee Jarred Gillett had his work cut out – nearly every decision he made was vociferously contested by one side or the other, and the opening period ended with five names in his notebook. He had accrued a total of 11 by the time the shootout arrived. Meanwhile, Graham Arnold and Kevin Muscat spent much of their time stalking the touchline and berating the fourth official.
The flow of the game suffered from the regular stoppages, playacting and constant recriminations – and arguably the state of the pitch, which had been used for a Super Rugby fixture the previous night despite a last-ditch attempt to shift that fixture elsewhere. With both team’s more creative players stifled, the likes of Ninković and Rojas were unable to stamp their authority in the way they might have been expected.
With supply lines cut, scoring opportunities were few and far between. Fahid Ben Khalfallah found Rojas at the back post with pinpoint accuracy after 11 minutes, but the New Zealand international’s pull back across the face of goal was turned over the bar by a Sydney defender.
Ninković was able, fleetingly, to give a glimpse of what he is capable of when he delivered a teasing ball across the face of goal on 16 minutes, the kind that must have been in mind when the term “corridor of uncertainty” was invented. Victory survived, but it led to a brief period when Sydney began to flex their muscles for the first time.
Berisha soon put paid to that with his individual moment of brilliance. The Kosovo international took on the Sydney defence with the kind of single-minded intent that has become his trademark. The way he scythed through Sydney’s backline showed scant regard for a defence that had, to that point, conceded just 12 goals all season. He has now scored in each of the four grand finals he has appeared in.
The initial spate of bookings came soon after the deadlock had been broken and it took just over 20 minutes for Khalfallah and James Troisi to been shown yellow, along with Sydney’s Josh Brillante, Ninković and Filip Hološko. Three of those names were taken following an ugly 20-man coming together in the centre circle as tempers boiled over in a moment that typified the first half.
Any hopes that cooler heads would emerge after the break soon evaporated as Victory skipper Carl Valeri levelled the booking ledger by becoming Victory’s third man into the book, for a crude challenge that might have warranted a straight red on another day.
Football was, however, occasionally allowed to shine through amid the pervading fug. Most of it came from Sydney in the second half and it was the home side who fashioned the better chances – first Hološko ballooned over from close range when he should really have done better, and then David Carney, on for Hološko, saw an effort saved by Thomas.
Carney, who won the title 11 years ago during his first stint with Sydney, was to play a key role moments later. It was his curling shot that Lawrence Thomas tipped onto the inside of the post, leaving a desperate, prone Berisha to head feebly into the path of the onrushing Grant. The right-back tapped gleefully home.
The goal further invigorated Sydney, yet try as they might and amid much huffing and puffing they were unable to blow down Victory’s door again in regulation time. Indeed, they could have been caught on the break, as Rojas and Troisi combined well, but the latter lacked a finishing touch.
“The first half was difficult,” Arnold said. “The first half we didn’t play our way, we ended up playing a game of kick and rush and fighting for the second ball. And when you have the quality of players like Ninković and Brosque that’s not their type of game.
“I said at half-time I’d rather lose than not play our way, the way we’ve played all season, the way we’ve created history with a lot of things. I wanted us to play our way and we did.”
To extra-time and Victory pulses again quickened, momentarily, when a high ball was launched into the box before it skewed away from a posse of players and brushed the outside of the post; the flag was up, regardless.
After the changeover, and with tired limbs in evidence all over the pitch, Troisi dug deep and mustered what so nearly could have been the defining moment of the game – a truly brilliant volley that arguably deserved to be the winner, but he saw it cannon back off Vukovic’s upright.
At the other end, Carney had a chance to settle it with five minutes remaining but he sliced his shot horribly to leave the expectant home crowd frustrated – and preparing to accept that their entire season, which had been so dominant, would not only come down to a winner-takes-all match, but rather one decisive penalty shootout. This time for Sydney, they will feel justice was served.
While no one is immune, pollution particularly affects children, whose lungs are still developing. Key culprits are diesel vehicles, followed by gas combustion from boilers and cookers.
Air pollution shares none of the intractable characteristics of problems such as climate change and microbial resistance. Unlike the latter, air pollution, on the whole, respects international borders and does not require the international treaties and agreements that can take years to hammer out.
Cleaning up our air is eminently achievable with the right package of measures. We need a mix of clean air zones that include charging owners of diesel vehicles to drive into densely populated urban areas, a scrappage scheme for diesel cars, a tax system that discourages owners from buying diesel and much tougher European testing.
The government is clearly concerned about proposing any measures that would hit diesel drivers a few weeks before the general election. Yet Thursday’s local election results show it has nothing to fear: barring an electoral earthquake, it is on course for a decisive victory. Votes before lives: that’s Theresa May’s telling choice.
Macron, 39, a former economy minister who ran as a “neither left nor right” independent promising to shake up the French political system, took 65.1% to Le Pen’s 34.9%, according to initial projections from early counts.
His victory was hailed by his supporters as holding back a tide of populism after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s victory in the US election.
He promised to unite a divided and fractured France, saying: “I will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.”
Speaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago, he said: “Everyone said it was impossible. But they didn’t know France!”
Turnout was the lowest in more than 40 years. Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen, with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers.
Macron, who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago, is France’s youngest president. Next Sunday, he will take over a country under a state of emergency, still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment. France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war.
François Bayrou, an ex-minister and Macron’s centrist ally, said: “He is the youngest head of state on the planet [which] sends an incredible message of hope. Macron is giving hope to people who had no hope. Hope that maybe we can do something, go beyond the [left-right] divide that no longer makes sense.”
The outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, who was once Macron’s mentor and had appointed him economy minister, said: “His large victory confirms that a very great majority of our citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union and show France is open to the world.”
Macron’s victory came not only because voters supported his policy platform for free market, pro-business reform, and his promises to energise the EU, coupled with a leftwing approach to social issues. Some of his voters came from other parties across the political spectrum and turned out not in complete support of his programme but to stop the Front National.
In a political landscape with a strong hard left and far right, Macron faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! (On the Move!) in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises.
In Brussels and Berlin, there was relief that Le Pen’s anti-EU, anti-globalisation programme was defeated.
A spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said it was a “victory for a strong and united Europe” while the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said French voters had chosen a “European future”.
The office of the British prime minister, Theresa May, said she “warmly congratulates” Macron on his victory and “we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities”.
Macron, a former investment banker and senior civil servant who grew up in a bourgeois family in Amiens, served as deputy chief of staff to Hollande but was not part of the Socialist party.
 The rightwing candidate, François Fillon, once seen as favourite, was badly damaged by a judicial investigation into a string of corruption allegations, including that he paid his wife and children generous salaries from public funds for fake parliamentary assistant jobs.
The ruling Socialist party, under its candidate Benoît Hamon, saw its score plunge to 6%, while the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon finished fourth.
The final round marks a redrawing of the political landscape, away from the old left-right divide towards a contest between a liberal, pro-globalisation stance and “close the borders” nationalism. Le Pen has styled the election as being between her party’s “patriots” and the “globalists” whom she says Macron represents.
The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.
The gap was down to two lengths at the line, Rhododendron having powered past the third-placed Daban, but the winner had kept on too gamely, having had a trouble-free run up the centre of the track. Moore said “yes” when asked if he had been unlucky in running but stopped short of claiming he ought to have won.
Asked what would have happened if he’d had a clear run, the jockey replied: “I don’t know. She travelled beautifully and just when I needed to be making my run, I ran out of room at an important stage. She obviously ran a very good race and the winner’s a very good horse as well. I think they’re two good fillies.”
Moore’s weekend may have ended in frustration but he can still look forward to riding both Guineas winners in their future races. O’Brien, meanwhile, was completing a double in the Newmarket Classics for the third time in his career. He ran horses in five Group races here over the weekend, winning four and coming up just a neck short in the other.
For this 27th success in a British Classic, he has to be grateful for the retirement last year of David Wachman, who trained Winter as a juvenile.
Wachman, who won this race with Legatissimo two years ago, may now have some regrets about bowing out, though Michael Tabor, part-owner of Winter, doubted that.
“I think he’d be pleased as punch, knowing David,” Tabor said. “He’s a team player and if he wanted to train this year, he would be training her. But he’s got other ambitions, which I understand, and good luck to him.”
Another consequence of Wachman’s departure is that his jockey, Wayne Lordan, now works full time for O’Brien and achieved his first Classic success aboard Winter. Previously best known in Britain for winning top-class sprints on Sole Power and Slade Power, the 35-year-old adds significant depth to the roster of jockeys at Ballydoyle.
O’Brien’s mind must already be switching gears for the task of producing a credible Derby contender, with Epsom less than four weeks away. He surely cannot look to any of his three colts which took part in the Leopardstown trial on Sunday and were separated by just a neck at the line. “I don’t know if the Derby winner’s there,” Tabor said.
Tabor seems interested in the possibility of sending Churchill to Epsom but that would run counter to the established Ballydoyle modus operandi. There is a lot of stallion potential in a star miler and why ruin that by stretching him out to the Derby distance? O’Brien didn’t do that with Gleneagles two years ago and seems unlikely to do it this time, especially if he can win one of the trials over the next fortnight. Cliffs Of Moher looks a candidate if he lands Chester’s Dee Stakes on Friday.
Richard Hannon said here that his 2,000 Guineas runner-up, Barney Roy, is unlikely to be aimed at the Derby, despite appearing third in betting lists. The final decision will be made by Godolphin but the trainer expects to aim the colt at the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.
ITV Racing appear to have had a good weekend. Their 2,000 Guineas programme on Saturday achieved a peak viewing figure of 800,000, the broadcaster reported, compared to 610,000 on Channel 4 last year, when the race was a week earlier. This year’s average of 578,000 was up from 355,000 last year.

The three-time Olympian, three-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champion was 37.
“The only reason why the USA is in any conversation in the sport of bobsled is because of Steve Holcomb,” said US bobsled pilot Nick Cunningham, who roomed next to Holcomb in Lake Placid. “He was the face of our team. He was the face of our sport. We all emulated him. Every driver in the world watched him, because he was that good at what he did. It’s a huge loss, huge loss, not just for our team but for the entire bobsled community.”
No cause of death was immediately announced, but officials said there were no indications of foul play after the preliminary parts of an ongoing investigation were completed. USA Bobsled and Skeleton said it was believed Holcomb died in his sleep.
An autopsy was scheduled for Sunday. Funeral arrangements are expected to be finalized in the coming days.
“USA Bobsled and Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend,” federation CEO Darrin Steele said.
Holcomb was a native of Park City, Utah, and his signature moment came at the 2010 Vancouver games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold medal drought for the US in bobsled’s signature race.
“The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb,” US Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said. “Steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, and his perseverance and achievements were an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve’s family and the entire bobsledding community.”
Holcomb was still one of the world’s elite drivers, finishing second on the World Cup circuit in two-man points and third in four-man points this past season.
The final victory of his career was last December in Lake Placid. He won 60 World Cup medals in his career, 10 more at the world championships and three in the Olympics, making him one of the most decorated pilots in the world.
“You will be loved, missed and remembered forever,” US women’s pilot Jamie Greubel Poser wrote on Twitter.
Holcomb was an Eagle Scout and served as both a member of the Utah Army National Guard and the Army World Class Athlete Program. He was cherubic, almost always happy in public, someone whose sense of humor was well-known throughout the close-knit bobsled world. Teammates even spent a season chronicling his “Holcy Dance,” a little less-than-rhythmic shuffle that he would do at each stop on the World Cup circuit to make fellow sliders laugh.
But there was also a troubled side, including battles with depression and alcohol, plus a failed hotel-room suicide attempt involving sleeping pills in 2007 which he wrote about in his autobiography, But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold.
“After going through all that and still being here, I realized what my purpose was,” Holcomb said in a 2014 interview.
Winning gold with push athletes Steve Mesler, Curt Tomasevicz and Justin Olsen at the Vancouver Olympics turned Holcomb into a full-fledged star. In the months that followed, Holcomb met President Barack Obama, played golf with Charles Barkley, hung out with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Cleveland Indians game and went to the Indianapolis 500.
In the bobsled world, he was larger than life. “We’re all still in shock,” Cunningham said. “I don’t know if mourning will happen for a long time, because the shock part will take a while.”
“Years of pay restraint and stressful working conditions are taking their toll,” said Chris Hopson, NHS Providers’ chief executive. “Pay is becoming uncompetitive. Significant numbers of trusts say lower paid staff are leaving to stack shelves in supermarkets rather than carry on with the NHS.”
“Pay restraint must end and politicians must therefore be clear about when during the lifetime of the next parliament it will happen and how.” He repeated the organisation’s demand for £25bn in extra funding to help the NHS in England get through until 2020 and warned that staff are also leaving because they are exhausted from having to work so constantly to keep up with the unprecedented demand for care.
Hopson added: “We are getting consistent reports of retention problems because of working pressures in the health service causing stress and burnout.”
“Is that enough considering the brilliant work that they do? I think many people would say they want to pay them more. I think they do an incredible job. If you want more money to go into the NHS – and this government recognises we will need to put more money into the NHS and the social care system because of the pressures we face – then the question is how you get there,” said Hunt.
Responding to Hopson’s comments on NHS pay, Ashworth added: “This is a stark warning from NHS Providers about the Conservatives’ catastrophic management of the NHS workforce. It is incredible and disgraceful that NHS staff are leaving to work in supermarkets instead because NHS pay has been squeezed so far. The country’s shortage of paramedics, nurses and consultants now threatens a raft of NHS strategies to provide better services for patients.”
NHS Providers are also warning that understaffing is so serious in mental health services that patients are now suffering delays in receiving treatment, taking longer to recover and having a bad experience of NHS care. “We are particularly worried about the pressures in the mental health workforce,” said Hopson. “These are resulting in delays in treatment, people are taking longer to recover, and as a result their care is more expensive and their experience is worse.”
It was the first time in 13 league meetings between the managers that Wenger had come out on top but the bigger picture for Mourinho concerned what he felt was the end of United’s top-four hopes. With three matches to go, United are four points behind the fourth-placed Manchester City and Mourinho said that he was pinning his hopes of reaching next season’s Champions League on winning the Europa League.
United are 1-0 up against Celta Vigo from the semi-final first leg last Thursday. The return leg is at Old Trafford this Thursday, after which United will play their final three league games – against Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton (both away) and Crystal Palace (home) – in the space of eight days.
“The top four? Impossible,” Mourinho said. “For two reasons. I don’t think the other clubs [in the race], who are playing one match a week, are going to lose. And, because we go with everything on Thursday [against Celta Vigo], we cannot go with everything at Tottenham.
“Go with everything at Tottenham and it’s difficult. Without everything, it’s more difficult. Then we play Southampton and Palace. I don’t think we have any chance of the top four. We have to chase the Champions League by trying to win the Europa League.”
Wenger denied that the win over Mourinho’s team meant anything special – he was concerned purely with keeping Arsenal’s own top-four hopes alive. They have a game in hand on City, who they trail by six points. Mourinho was rather more theatrical on the subject of his first competitive defeat against Wenger.
“Arsenal’s fans are happy and I’m happy for them,” he said. “It’s the first time I leave and they’re happy. I leave Highbury, they were crying. I leave the Emirates and they were crying – walking the streets with heads low. Today they leave with their scarves [waving in the air]. It’s a big club. You think I enjoy a big club like Arsenal not winning trophies? I don’t enjoy it. But today I tried to win.
“Arsène Wenger is not a small manager, he’s a big manager – to have that record of winning so many matches [against him] is not normal. Normal is win, lose, draw. I really don’t care about it today. No problems. We shook hands and during the game I don’t like what I never like. He puts too much pressure on the fourth official every time.”
Wenger said that he started with Danny Welbeck because the former United striker always raises his game against his old club, and he saw him score the second goal. Granit Xhaka had opened the scoring in the 54th minute with a shot that deflected heavily off Ander Herrera.
“We started a bit nervous and under pressure but slowly we became better and, in the second half we controlled well the game,” Wenger said. “The first goal was quite lucky and the second goal was a great goal. I’m happy for Danny. Hopefully it gives him confidence.
“We now have a big game on Wednesday night at Southampton and we need to be calm and focused. We still have a chance [of the top four] and we need some help from teams around us. I watched the Liverpool game [against Southampton] before we kicked off and I saw the penalty that the referee gave to them. It was a very nice decision.”
Mourinho had a different take on the match at Arsenal. “We didn’t deserve to lose,” he said. “The game was under control. They had a couple of chances in the first half but so did we and ours were the big chances. Arsenal scored and afterwards they brought the block low and defended well and coped with our attacking football.”
Jonny Bairstow has done all he can to nudge England towards a rethink of their plans before this summer’s Champions Trophy with his brutal exhibition of hitting and the golden arm of Joe Root setting up an 85-run win over Ireland at Lord’s.
Asked to bat under initial grey skies, England hustled their way to 328 for six with Root and Morgan striking 73 and 76 respectively in a stand of 140 before Bairstow turned on the afterburners at the back end of the innings with an unbeaten 72 from 44 balls.
Facing a target one greater than their famous chase of 328 against the same opposition in Bangalore six years ago, Ireland were bowled out for 243 in 46.1 overs as Root’s off-breaks returned three for 52 and Liam Plunkett took three for 23. Nevertheless, individuals stood up for the supportersin green, with 82 from the captain, William Porterfield, following a brawny 48 by the Middlesex opener Paul Stirling.
Stirling’s initial salvo, one of eight crunched fours and a mighty six over the ridiculously short boundary, was, truth be told, the only time England looked as if they might end up grateful for the late flourish to their own innings, where 61 runs were reaped from the final four overs as Bairstow put on something of a show for the 23,000-strong crowd.
The Yorkshireman is due to be a drinks-carrier when Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler return from the Indian Premier League to face South Africa this month before the summer’s main event. But as he mowed Ireland’s bowlers to all parts his inability to command a regular place seemed all the more baffling. At the very least the position of first reserve ahead of Sam Billings – who was given the gloves ahead of him in Buttler’s absence – has surely been locked down.
Putting on 88 in 7.4 overs with his county team-mate Adil Rashid, who wristily flicked a 25-ball 39 from No7 himself, Bairstow delivered his full repertoire, standing tall with his high backlift and manipulating boundaries through power and placement.
Bar one heart-in-the-mouth moment, when George Dockrell held him on the midwicket rope on 43 only to tumble over and throw the ball back into play, he positively glowed in the form that brought him 1,470 Test runs last year, cracking seven fours as well as three sixes.
After heads understandably dropped in the field on Friday, Ireland’s performance in the field was much sharper. Tim Murtagh got the new ball to nibble first up on his home ground, castling Alex Hales on 32 with one that seamed up the slope, while his fellow right-armer Barry McCarthy – until some late tap from Bairstow – was the pick with two for 61.
Porterfield rotated his attack throughout, making 23 bowling changes in a bid to prevent the home side settling. Settle they did, however, after Hales and Jason Roy fell in the space of three overs – the latter picking out extra cover to make it 60 for two in the 13th – with Morgan and Root then easing to half-centuries at around a run a ball when an England team of old might have consolidated.
Morgan, whose one wobble before eventually chipping McCarthy to extra cover came on 39 when a ball from Stirling’s off-spin trickled on to the stumps without disturbing them, carved the bowlers in typical fashion thereafter, while Root glossily stroked his way to a fifth 50-plus score in seven innings this year before picking out mid-off.
England struggled early in the reply – not least David Willey, who saw his three overs with the new ball crashed for 23 runs and did not return – but after Jake Ball removed Stirling in the 14th over, thanks to a faint snick behind picked up on review, the second innings belonged to Root, who bowled the full allocation for the first time in his one-day career.
Castling Ed Joyce with a sliding round-arm delivery for 16, and then getting Niall O’Brien and Gary Wilson held in the deep, Root’s form with the ball may be the best way for his fellow Yorkshireman, Bairstow, to be retained in a move that would mean England leaving Moeen Ali out as they have during this mini-series.
With Chris Woakes similarly coming back from the IPL, Plunkett made sure he will not be one to make way following a strong tour of the Caribbean in March by trapping Andy Balbirnie lbw with an 89mph delivery and persuading both Murtagh and McCarthy to pick out Ball on the rope in his second spell.
Rashid followed his five-wicket showing in Bristol by ending Kevin O’Brien’s brief repeat of his Bangalore six-hitting on 18. Mark Wood, who along with Willey endured some early butchery from Stirling, snuffed out Portferfield’s vigil when he was bowled trying a flick down leg, before completing the win by crashing a yorker into Dockrell’s stumps.
Instead, the paper went with images of Prince Harry kissing his girlfriend and a story about insurance companies being unscrupulous.
Macron’s victory did make it onto the front of the Daily Telegraph, but the historic news was presented solely in relation to how it could impact Britain’s exit from the EU. The paper’s page one headline made no mention of the far-right candidate being beaten by centrist Macron and instead warned that his victory “puts cloud over Brexit”.
It was a sentiment echoed – albeit via far fewer column inches – by the Mirror.
Elsewhere, the Times and Financial Times played it pretty straight. The Times lauded a “landslide for Macron”, while the FT announced “Macron sweeps to victory” as French voters opted for “globalism over populism”.
With The Sun silent on the result, it was left to the Metro to inject a bit of fun and come up with what is arguably the best pun of the day.
“The vow is we must never, ever allow Forest to be in this situation again,” the relieved manager, Mark Warburton, said after the game. “Can’t happen. The last five or six weeks, the relegation dogfight, it’s not what we’re about. We told the players: ‘Remember the feeling at kick‑off’, and that must never happen again.”
Before the game at the City Ground Mick McCarthy promised that he wanted to give the Ipswich fans “something to smile about” despite having nothing to play for, but one imagines not many of the travelling support came away with grins on their faces. This was not so much a bad performance as a non-performance, unable to take advantage of the inevitable nerves from a relegation-threatened side.
Forest started with some purpose, going close through a curling Jamie Ward shot in the third minute, but the nerves showed when Jordan Smith fumbled a routine cross, like a child handed a valuable vase and sternly told to absolutely, 100%, under no circumstances break it. Shortly afterwards, though, Smith made a save that Warburton described as “world-class”, tipping the ball on to the bar while changing direction after a close‑range Grant Ward shot took a deflection. Given the nerves that showed in leaden legs and confused decision-making early on, that save probably kept Forest up.
Forest still looked jittery after the break, sitting deep and with little composure to their play. But after 57 minutes they doubled the lead: David Vaughan squared to the captain, Cohen, around 25 yards out and his shot took a flick off a defender on its way to the top corner. There could not have been a more appropriate and popular scorer than the club captain, making his 300th appearance after last season returning from his third cruciate ligament injury.
Ten minutes later Forest had the chance to remove all doubt, when professional irritant Ward won another penalty, this time barged to the ground by substitute Josh Emmanuel. Assombalonga stepped up and side-footed to Bialkowski’s left but the goalkeeper produced a wonderful save to tip the ball over the bar.
No matter, though. Five minutes later Assombalonga jinked down the side of the area, was shown on to his left foot by a backtracking Luke Chambers and, accepting the invitation, launched the ball into the roof of the net with that very foot. A few moments later Vaughan, as so often Forest’s most composed character in midfield, crunched into a (fair) tackle and, for the first time in a while at the City Ground, there was a sense that everything was going to be OK.
Warburton’s thoughts have already turned to the summer and next season, with a clear idea of how he wants to shape the squad with the help of Frank McParland, the director of football he called “the best in the business”. Warburton said: “We’re not proud of being in a relegation fight. It’s a muted celebration in that respect but the job’s been done and now we can build.”
At St James’ Park, goals from Ayoze Pérez, Chancel Mbemba and the substitute Dwight Gayle secured a deserved 3-0 victory against Barnsley in front of the owner, Mike Ashley, and a crowd of 52,276 at St James’ Park, and Jack Grealish’s last-gasp equaliser for Aston Villa denied Brighton victory to allow the Magpies to leap-frog them into top spot.
Rafael Benítez, the Newcastle manager, has insisted for weeks that promotion was the only objective, but as he prepares for the talks with Ashley which will determine whether or not he remains on Tyneside he will do so with a bonus piece of silverware sitting in the trophy cabinet.
Shorn of the services of Jamaal Lascelles and the winger Matt Ritchie through suspension and injury respectively, Benítez was forced to play the midfielder Isaac Hayden in central defence, although his problems grew when the former Arsenal man had to leave the field with a head injury. As a result, the Magpies were disjointed as they set about their task with Barnsley enjoying the better of the opening 15 minutes.
However, as the midfielder Christian Atsu roused them from their slumbers, they slipped into gear and took the lead with 23 minutes gone. Jonjo Shelvey expertly clipped Aleksandar Mitrovic’s lay-off into the path of Atsu, who cut inside the full-back Callum Elder before back-heeling the ball to DeAndre Yedlin to cross for Pérez to cleverly flick home.
The Barnsley goalkeeper, Adam Davies, did well to turn Atsu’s fierce shot over the bar after the winger had tricked his way past Elder with the visitors under intense pressure, and he excelled himself a minute before the break to deny the same man as he fired hard and low towards the far post.
The substitute Massadio Haïdara blazed over from 12 yards just before the break and Pérez tested Davies seconds after it as Newcastle dominated but struggled to kill off the game. That changed when Davies dived to save Pérez’s stinging 59th-minute effort, only for Mbemba to follow up from close range and make it 2-0.
Davies was called up once again 10 minutes later to tip over Mitrovic’s header and Shelvey struck the foot of the post two minutes later, but opposite number Rob Eliot had to make late saves from substitutes Marley Watkins and Elliot Lee to preserve his clean sheet. Gayle added a third at the death and news of Villa’s equaliser sent the home fans into raptures.
The Seagulls were already promoted, ending a 34-year exile from the top flight, and victory would have seen them go up as champions but they lacked urgency and rhythm for long spells.
Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said: “Today is a negative day, it’s difficult, but there are far more pluses. What these lads have achieved this season has been magnificent. David has been excellent for us all season and he had made two very good saves from free-kicks before. There’s never any portion of blame. We have to accept it as a team.
“For us the season is finished and we have achieved our goal. We’re playing in a division where there are some very big teams, who have spent big money, and we have managed to come in the top two.”
Brighton rode their luck in the first half and Henri Lansbury wasted a glorious Villa chance as the home side finished a disappointing season 13th with the manager, Steve Bruce, needing to revamp his squad in the summer.
Villa, relegated last year, had long hoped there would be a promotion party in Birmingham but it was the visitors who were celebrating going up – even if they struggled to get going. Lansbury’s low effort was shovelled wide by Stockdale during a low key start. It was competitive enough but there was little action until Lansbury somehow managed to head wide from five yards after Sébastien Pocognoli chested the ball into his path.
Brighton seemed too relaxed over their title chase and needed Stockdale to bail them out after another Pocognoli error after 33 minutes. The on-loan West Bromwich Albion defender played a blind backpass to slip in Scott Hogan but Stockdale deflected his shot wide and the goalkeeper was then needed again to save Conor Hourihane’s free kick.
There was little on offer from Brighton and they survived a huge penalty scare five minutes after the restart when Lewis Dunk tackled Keinan Davis but the referee, Darren Bond, waved away Villa’s protests. But the visitors suddenly woke up as Murray headed wide and then Baldock forced Sam Johnstone into a smart save just before the hour. And the title swung Brighton’s way when they went ahead after 64 minutes. Murray slipped in Baldock and he managed to scuff an effort at Johnstone, only for the referee to rule Baker had fouled him before he got his shot away. The defender was sent off and Murray scored from the spot, his 23rd goal of the season.
Four minutes later Brighton should have doubled their lead when James Chester blocked Baldock’s effort following Tommy Elphick’s short backpass. But while it remained 1-0 there was always a chance the Seagulls could lose the title and Stockdale had to produce a fine stop from Hourihane’s free kick with five minutes left. However, the 31-year-old then cost his side the league title when he allowed Grealish’s low 25-yard effort to sneak in with a minute left.

Under Ireland’s Defamation Act 2009 a person who publishes or utters blasphemous material “shall be guilty of an offence”. A conviction can lead to a fine of up to €25,000.
While being interviewed on The Meaning of Life TV programme, Fry was asked what he would say to God if he had a chance.
“I’d say ‘Bone cancer in children, what’s that about?’ How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault,” Fry replied. “It’s not right. It’s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?”
Fry said if he met the Greek gods he would accept them quicker because, “they didn’t present themselves as being all seeing, all wise, all beneficent”.
“Because the god who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish. We have to spend our lives on our knees thanking him. What kind of god would do that?”
“I told the garda I wanted to report Fry for uttering blasphemy and RTÉ for publishing/broadcasting it and that I believed these were criminal offences under the Defamation Act 2009.
“The garda then took a formal written statement from me in which I quoted Fry’s comments in detail. This written statement mentioned both Fry and RTÉ specifically.”
He said he was asked by the garda if he had been personally offended by the programme and if he wished to include this in the written statement.
“I told the garda that I did not want to include this as I had not personally been offended by Fry’s comments – I added that I simply believed that the comments made by Fry on RTÉ were criminal blasphemy and that I was doing my civic duty by reporting a crime.”
After hearing nothing for 18 months, the complainant wrote to the head of the Irish police, Commissioner Noirín O’Sullivan, “asking if the crime I reported was being followed up. A few weeks later I got a standard ‘we have received your letter’ from her secretary.”
But recently the man was contacted by a detective from Donnybrook garda station in Dublin (the same suburb where RTÉ is headquartered) to say they were looking into the blasphemy claim. “He said he might have to meet me to take a new more detailed statement.”
“I was merely saying things that many finer heads than mine have said for hundreds of years, as far back as the Greeks ... I never wished to offend anybody who is individually devout or pious, and indeed many Christians have been in touch with me to say that they are very glad that things should be talked about.”
The host of the The Meaning Of Life programme, Gay Byrne, said “Of course [Fry] hadn’t wished to cause offence. But that’s what the internet is for, controversy, debate and people’s opinions.”
This film inflates Fassbender’s robot role hugely. He first appears in an eerie, interesting opening sequence which the rest of the film cannot really match: a huge white room, with a grand piano, a panorama-window showing some generic alpine landscape, a full-scale model of Michelangelo’s David, and other high-art objects. There we find Fassbender’s robot being questioned by his testy scientist-creator Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and invited to choose a name for himself, the robot hubristically says David, after the statue.
Should they chance everything by going down and taking a look? Should they, much more to the point, walk around down there without their protective helmets and spacesuits on, so that evil spores from little pod-like growths can get into their ear canals and up their noses? Have these people learned nothing at all?
Just as in Prometheus, the action is opened out from the claustrophobic confines of the spaceship to the vast prospects of a distant planet, which turns out to be a mix of Pompeii and Easter Island.

Britain has more billionaires than ever in what equality campaigners said was a clear sign the UK economy is only working for the few at the top.
“While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain’s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the rich list.
Today, the Hinduja Group employs more than 70,000 people and has global investments in a range of sectors including oil and gas, property, media and banking. Current projects include the transformation of the Old War Office in Westminster into a luxury hotel.
The Equality Trust said the £83bn increase in wealth among the richest 1,000 people over the past year could pay the energy bills of all UK households for two and a half years and would be enough for the grocery bills for all food bank users for 56 years.
Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust, said that an elite was sitting on mountains of wealth in the fifth largest economy of the world. “The super-rich continue to streak away from the rest of us, while the poorest see their wealth shrink. This is an economy working for the few, not the many,” she said.
“Record numbers of people visited food banks last year, millions are locked out of a decent home and two-thirds of children in poverty are in working households.
“We know that inequality damages our economy and society, and makes it harder for ordinary people and their children to get on. With the general election fast approaching, our politicians need to decide the sort of country they want to build. One where we can all prosper or one where we’re picking crumbs from the super-rich’s table.”
At least 28 of the top 100 individuals or families in the rich list have donated to the Conservative party or individual Tory politicians, according to the Electoral Commission’s records. Among them are David and Simon Reuben, third on the list, who donated to Boris Johnson.
Others in the top 10 who donated to the party include Guy, George and Galen Weston and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, who donated to the West Suffolk Conservatives.
The combined wealth of all the Conservative donors on the list is £102bn, according to the analysis by Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. “The fact that nearly a third of UK’s 100 richest people have given money to the Tories tells you all you need to know about where Theresa May’s priorities lie,” Watson said. “She claims to speak for working people but she’s beholden to the billionaires that bankroll her party.”
Watts said there was more diversity in this years’ rich list. “More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with private equity barons and hedge fund managers.”
The go-ahead for the nation state bill by the ministerial committee for legislation means it will now move forward to a vote by the country’s parliament. The bill has to pass several stages in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for it to become law and could also be challenged in the courts.
Critics say the law is discriminatory and could undermine Israel’s balance of being both a Jewish and democratic state by harming the rights of minorities.
Hebrew and Arabic are both Israel’s national languages, but the bill states that Hebrew would be the lone national language, downgrading Arabic to “a special status in the state” whose “speakers have the right to language-accessible state services”.
The legislation is designed to be enshrined in Israel’s basic law, regarded as the closest approximation in Israel to a constitution.
The timing of the bill – after four years of deliberations – is significant, coming two weeks before a planned visit by Donald Trump in which the US president had hoped to breath life into a moribund peace process.
Although the bill has undergone some changes in the drafting process – not least removing language that would have seen Israel’s democracy subordinated in importance to its Jewish identity – it remains highly contentious.
While the way Israel’s legislative process functions has long allowed parties and individuals to put forward legislation likely to be challenged by the courts, the latest proposed law comes in the context of Israel’s most rightwing ever government.
The committee approved the bill unanimously but the measure has been condemned by opposition politicians, academics and in some parts of the Israeli media.
Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, representing Arab-Israeli parties, said the bill was a “declaration of war” on Israel’s Arab citizens. “Discrimination has received a legal stamp. The danger in this law in that it establishes two classes of citizen – Jewish and Arab,” he said.
Erel Margalit, a contender for the leadership of the centrist Zionist Union party, called the bill “reminiscent of dark periods” in history.
Zehava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, said the bill’s intention was to downgrade the rights of non-Jews in Israel. “The result of the Jewish state bill is clear. Jews will get preference over all other citizens, clearly violating human rights, democracy and the rights of the Arab minority in Israel,” she said.
The bill’s sponsor, Avi Dichter, an MP from Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, defended the proposals, as did other ministers.
 ”This is a small step for the Jewish state bill, which establishes that Israel is and will be a Jewish and democratic state, and it’s a big step towards defining our identity, not only in the eyes of the world but primarily for ourselves, Israelis – to be a free people in our land,” said Dichter after the committee’s vote.
He said the bill was necessary because “events of recent months prove that this is a battle for Israel’s image and national identity. The Palestinians no longer hide their goal of erasing the Jewish people’s nation state”.
The legislative committee’s chairman, Yariv Levin, also a Likud MP, said he had decided to put an end to foot-dragging over the bill. “We’ve been waiting to discuss and make a decision on this legislation for too long. This is a basic law, which has the simple objective of safeguarding Israel’s status as the nation state of the Jewish people. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been made into law so far,” he said.
The suspicions that Canelo Álvarez’s pay-per-view showdown with Julio César Chávez Jr was a sideshow not worthy of your time, say nothing of the hefty $70 price tag, proved founded early in Saturday’s one-sided beatdown on the Las Vegas Strip. This one was more of an event than a fight: a celebration of Cinco de Mayo featuring two of Mexico’s most popular boxers masquerading as authentic sports experience for fans.
Álvarez won every minute of every round against an opponent who is his rival in narrative only. Not once during the 12-round mismatch, which took place at a contracted catchweight of 164½lbs, did the popular red-headed puncher from Guadalajara sit on his stool between rounds. One could imagine Canelo suffered sparring sessions in training camp more taxing than Saturday’s light workout before a sold-out crowd at the T-Mobile Arena. When it was over, all three ringside judges turned in identical scores of 120-108, as did the Guardian. A total whitewash and, candidly, a bit of an embarrassment.
“GGG, you are next my friend,” the 26-year-old Álvarez, a former champion at junior middleweight and middleweight and the presumptive face of the sport in boxing’s post-Mayweather age, said through a translator. “The fight is done. I’ve never feared anyone, since I was 16 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone. I never got my share of fear. I’m very happy, and the rivalry is going to show my skills even more. I’ve had difficult fights, and that will no doubt be a tough fight. But, I always say, Canelo Álvarez is the best because I fight the best.”
The shrewdly timed announcement, an inspired piece of stagecraft which speaks volumes about what Canelo’s handlers thought of Chávez’s chances, was a convenient way to make people forget about what they had just watched.
Chávez (50-3-1, 32 KOs), a former middleweight beltholder who lost his strap to the great Sergio Martínez five years ago, was so drained at Friday’s weigh-in that he looked ready to pass out, prompting fears he might come out even slower due to the weight cut. Those fears, it turned out, had merit. The son of the greatest fighter in Mexico’s rich fistic history labored to produce anything resembling an offense and Canelo, who dictated the distance, standing mid-range unmolested in what felt like acres of space, got off first time and again. By the end of the third round, a trickle of blood ran from the bigger man’s nose.
By the sixth, Canelo was simply walking Chávez down, setting up his punches beautifully, unconcerned with single-shot return fire, landing as many per round as his opponent was throwing. Even when Chávez had openings to uncork, he couldn’t pull the trigger. Thus he appeared content to lay back in an effort to extend the fight, perhaps endowed with the grim self-knowledge that any resistance would only hasten his demise.
By the ninth, Chávez’s left eye was nearly fully closed and a feeling of discomfort seemed to prevail among the well-lubricated capacity crowd of 20,516, who had started the night bellowing singalongs in the stands to Mexican standards Tragos Amargos and La Ley Del Monte but had now descended into cascades of boos. For what exactly? Certainly not the surgical work of Álvarez, who gave no quarter in the so-called championship rounds in his effort to close the show. The bloodletting was on and it was hard to understand how anyone could feel particularly good about bearing witness to the punishment, which truly should have been stopped by referee Kenny Bayless or any sane party. For years Chávez’s commitment has been called into question, and correctly, but no one can doubt his chin: even from a smaller man these were devastatingly hard shots.
The 31-year-old Chávez, who earned a guaranteed $3m for his trouble (compared to $5m for Álvarez), managed to finish the bout upright but nothing else. Few at ringside could remember the last time a fight put forth as a top-flight contest had ended with all three ringside judges failing to find even one round to give the loser.
“Tonight I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things,” said Álvarez, who landed 228 of 604 punches (37.7%), compared to 71 of 302 for Chávez (23.5%). “I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn’t do it. I’ve shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings. I’ve shown I can showcase myself.
“I wanted to try something new. I never sit down in sparring and I didn’t want to sit here.”
Said Chavez, also through a translator: “I wanted to box but he went to the ropes and I just needed to throw more punches. I would’ve attacked more I would’ve been countered by his punches. [Trainer Nacho Beristain] told me to do that but the strategy didn’t work.”
Now the eyes of the boxing world turn to the hotly anticipated meeting between Canelo and Golovkin, who watched from ringside on Saturday night.
“The fight is signed, sealed and delivered,” said Oscar De La Hoya, who promotes Álvarez. “I’ve already had several calls from people interested in staging this fight. I have a missed called from Dubai. I have a missed call from the UK where Anthony Joshua and (Wladimir) Klitschko just sold out 90,000 people. There’s interest from all over the world. There’s interest from everywhere.”
De La Hoya said the fight was “not tough at all” to make, adding that negotiations began several months ago but were halted out of respect for the Chavez fight. The Golden Boy Promotions founder said they restarted negotiations a few weeks ago and the contract was signed this week.
That set the stage for Saturday’s dramatic rollout. As Canelo conducted an in-ring interview with HBO’s Max Kellerman after the fight, the lights went down immediately when he announced Golovkin would be his next opponent. A video teaser played on the big screen as the Kazakh emerged from the tunnel to the ominous seven-note guitar lick of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army, his traditional ringwalk song.
“I feel very excited, right now is a different story,” Golovkin said. “In September, it will be a different style. A big drama show. I’m ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100% the is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September.”
Golovkin, 35, is coming off a points win over Daniel Jacobs at Madison Square Garden two months ago, his 18th straight middleweight title defense. It marked the first time in 24 fights he’d been extended the full distance, snapping a near-decade-long knockout streak that extended back to when he was fighting eight-rounders during the George W Bush administration. In that span he’s absorbed three of the four major world title belts at middleweight, while Canelo is lineal champion by virtue of his career-best win over Miguel Cotto in November 2015 (though, notably, that bout took place at a catchweight of 155lbs, five below the division limit).
“Everyone understands this is a tough fight for both of us,” Golovkin (37-0, 33 KOs) said afterward. “This is amazing fight for everyone. Of course, I respect his team. Everybody wanted this fight.”
Jason Woodward, the New Zealand‑born full-back who joined Bristol from the Hurricanes last autumn, has been included in an England training squad that will gather on Tuesday for a strength and conditioning camp.
Woodward, who spent two years with the Rebels in Melbourne but left before he qualified to play for the Wallabies on residency to have a tilt at the All Blacks, is one of nine players in the 20 who will gather in Teddington but are not in the squad for the summer tour to Argentina.
Woodward has a year on his contract left with Bristol but it is believed to contain a release clause and he has been linked with a move to Gloucester. A year in the Championship would hinder his England ambitions, with Jones saying this year that he is looking for competition for Mike Brown at full-back.
Jones ruled out Woodward before the start of the Six Nations Championship, saying that he was looking for a player with explosive pace and citing two three‑quarters, Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly, as potential alternatives, but the 26-year-old stood out for Bristol in a season that ended with relegation and he has played in the centre and on the wing.
Care’s rival in the England squad, Ben Youngs, has pulled out of the British & Irish Lions squad for the tour to New Zealand because the wife of his brother Tom has a terminal illness. The Lions gather in London on Monday to be kitted out and the Scotland captain, Greig Laidlaw, will be present having been called up to replace Youngs.
Fears that another scrum-half, Ireland’s Conor Murray, would be forced to withdraw from the Lions squad because of a shoulder injury he sustained during the Six Nations lifted on Saturday when he came off the Munster bench during the 50-14 victory over Connacht that took them to the top of the Pro 12.
Africa is home to 1.2 billion people, but by 2050 that number is likely to double, and may well double again by the end of the century to reach well over 4 billion. Globally, we may exceed 11 billion souls. This is of course a cause for celebration and a testament to the huge strides we’ve made in public health. We’ve all but beaten polio and yellow fever, mother and child mortality has plummeted, and we’re making headway in the fight against malaria.
Another cause for celebration is the confidence, energy and entrepreneurship in many parts of the African continent – a spirit that is unmatched anywhere in the world. It’s easy to see we’re on the cusp of enormous positive change.
The obvious flipside is the environmental disaster waiting to happen. This has been compounded by number crunchers who are leaving the future of our planet’s fragile ecosystems out of the equation as they try to come up with answers about how to fill billions of bellies. Several scenarios for cropland expansion – many of them focusing on Africa’s so-called “spare land” – have already effectively written off its elephants from having a future in the wild.
These projections have earmarked a huge swathe of land spanning from Nigeria to South Sudan for farming, or parts of west Africa for conversion to palm oil plantations. Economies are already being structured for the future, and are locking us into an unsustainable path to the tune of Feed the World – but with Africa providing the food.
But we can change this trajectory if we act now on three clear solutions – and even bring about a win-win scenario in which Africa’s future generations come out on top thanks to healthy ecosystems.
The first is better land-use planning; setting clear boundaries and limits on urban development and farming. The benefit here is that when constrained, we innovate. Land use becomes more considered and more efficient.
The second is agricultural yield – looking at food production in the sub-Saharan region and comparing it to, for example, the European Union, we can clearly see room for huge gains. With the right investment, yields could potentially double. Better choices and technology will remove the temptation simply to plough more land.
We have to see conservation not as a cost or a burden, but rather as an investment in our own survival
Third, we need conservation areas that generate tangible benefits for the people who live alongside wildlife, creating real, localised green economies that can secure local buy-in. Namibia has made great strides in providing for community-owned land outside national parks, while Kenya’s recent conservancies law creates a more robust framework for communities to protect and profit.
Most of all, we have to see conservation not as a cost or a burden, but rather as a business opportunity and an investment in our own survival. This is an argument I’ve carried with me into climate negotiations, where for years we’ve been disagreeing about who should foot the bill. At last we’re beginning to see an inclusive green economy and a shift to technologies like renewables as a bounty. These changes can be drivers of a better quality of life, better paid jobs, and a growth potential of decades.
Human wellbeing and the survival of our ecosystems are inextricably linked. The health of Africa’s elephants – a keystone species upon which countless others depend – serves as a barometer of not just the state of the environment, but also our prospects as a species. Simply put, we need to secure the space for both.

It needed therefore a new man – experienced, yes, but young, smart, advocating not the triumph of one camp (right or left), but reuniting them in a pragmatic and ambitious way with the best ideas and personalities of the right, the centre and the left. En Marche! was created by Macron just one year ago. Political leaders laughed then, but with 270,000 members and a candidate now elected president of the republic, it has become France’s leading political movement.
On the one hand he managed to convince people that it was important to liberate the country’s potential, create much better incentives for work, embrace entrepreneurship, free up markets, lower taxes, and give more autonomy to professors and school heads. And on the other hand, he said that it was vital to better protect the French by training them to do jobs in a new world, to focus the “welfare state” on those most in need, and to fight growing insecurity – both physical and material – with better teaching and more police officers.
What lessons can be drawn for the rest of the world? Macron has, in ending the left-right split, and slowed down the growth of populism, but – equally important – he has created a central platform that is strong, ambitious, reforming and optimistic, built on a clear understanding of the new world.
He will, however, need visible results in the next five years, or the extreme right or extreme left could win the 2022 presidential election.
The world should watch Macron closely. Because if he wins the war against populism and reduces unemployment while increasing stability, he can be an inspiration to many around the world.
“I don’t read the newspapers. I don’t have a television at home. I barely knew who Donald Trump was,” Li said during an interview at his agent’s 14-floor studio in a high-rise called Golden Triangle.
Li’s career as a Trump impersonator is still in its infancy; following his debut in Shenzhen he travelled to the nearby city of Zhongshan to perform at the opening of a lighting store and recorded a commercial for a tea company in his home province of Hunan.
Like Trump, Li is a master of bluster and bravado although his is delivered in a thick Hunanese accent. “[I’m] no ordinary person now. I’m a great man... I’m an internet celebrity now!” he boasts.
Ren Shihe, a impressionist from Xi’an who has spent three decades playing everyone from Leonid Brezhnev to Saddam Hussein, said he charged up to 30,000 yuan (£3,400) per appearance.
Zou Danrong, Li’s BMW-driving agent, admitted his Chinese Trump was still a work in progress. In a bid to make his black-haired apprentice more convincing he was trying to teach him to be more effeminate, like the real-life Trump, and planned to buy him some blue contact lenses.
 A well-known talent agent, Zou already represents a range of world leaders including a Kim Jong-un from Hebei province; a Barack Obama from Guangdong and a Vladimir Putin from Anhui.
“In the US people are free to protest and to hold Trump’s photograph upside down. In China no one would dare to do this,” he added. “That’s politics.”

The crucial problem isn’t creating new jobs. The crucial problem is creating new jobs that humans perform better than algorithms. Consequently, by 2050 a new class of people might emerge – the useless class. People who are not just unemployed, but unemployable.

One answer might be computer games. Economically redundant people might spend increasing amounts of time within 3D virtual reality worlds, which would provide them with far more excitement and emotional engagement than the “real world” outside. This, in fact, is a very old solution. For thousands of years, billions of people have found meaning in playing virtual reality games. In the past, we have called these virtual reality games “religions”.
What is a religion if not a big virtual reality game played by millions of people together? Religions like Islam and Christianity invent imaginary laws, such as “don’t eat pork”, “repeat the same prayers a set number of times each day”, “don’t have sex with somebody from your own gender”, and so forth. These laws exist only in the human imagination. No natural law requires the repetition of magical formulas and no natural law forbids homosexuality or eating pork. Muslims and Christians go through life trying to gain points in their favorite virtual reality game. If you pray every day, you get points. If you forget to pray, you lose points. If by the end of your life you gain enough points, then after you die you go to the next level of the game (aka Heaven).
As religions show us, the virtual reality need not be encased inside an isolated box. Rather, it can be superimposed on the physical reality. In the past this was done with the human imagination and with sacred books, and in the 21st century it can be done with smartphones.
Some time ago I went with my six-year-old nephew Matan to hunt for Pokémon. As we walked down the street, Matan kept looking at his smartphone, which enabled him to spot Pokémon all around us. I didn’t see any Pokémon at all, because I didn’t carry a smartphone. Then we saw two others kids on the street who were hunting the same Pokémon, and we almost got into a fight with them. It struck me how similar the situation was to the conflict between Jews and Muslims about the holy city of Jerusalem. When you look at the objective reality of Jerusalem, all you see are stones and buildings. There is no holiness anywhere. But when you look through the medium of smartbooks (such as the Bible and Qur’an), you see holy places and angels everywhere..
You gain points with new cars and vacations abroad. If you have more points than everybody else, you won the game
The idea of finding meaning in life by playing virtual reality games is of course common not just to religions, but also to secular ideologies and lifestyles. Consumerism too is a virtual reality game. You gain points by acquiring new cars, buying expensive brands, and taking vacations abroad, and if you have more points than everybody else, you tell yourself you won the game.
You might object that people really enjoy their cars and vacations. That’s certainly true. But the religious really enjoy praying and performing ceremonies and my nephew really enjoys hunting Pokémon. In the end, the real action always takes place inside the human brain. Does it matter whether the neurons are stimulated by observing pixels on a computer screen, by looking outside the windows of a Caribbean resort, or by seeing heaven in our mind’s eyes? In all cases, the meaning we ascribe to what we see is generated by our own minds. It is not really “out there”. To the best of our scientific knowledge, human life has no meaning. The meaning of life is always a fictional story created by us humans.
In his groundbreaking essay, Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight (1973), the anthropologist Clifford Geertz describes how on the island of Bali, people spent much time and money betting on cockfights. The betting and the fights involved elaborate rituals, and the outcomes had substantial impact on the social, economic and political standing of both players and spectators.
The cockfights were so important to the Balinese, that when the Indonesian government declared the practice illegal, people ignored the law and risked arrest and hefty fines. For the Balinese, cockfights were “deep play” – a made-up game that is invested with so much meaning that it becomes reality. A Balinese anthropologist could arguably have written similar essays on football in Argentina or Judaism in Israel.
Indeed, one particularly interesting section of Israeli society provides a unique laboratory for how to live a contented life in a post-work world. In Israel, a significant percentage of ultra-orthodox Jewish men never work. They spend their entire lives studying holy scriptures and performing religion rituals. They and their families don’t starve to death partly because the wives often work, and partly because the government provides them with generous subsidies. Though they usually live in poverty, government support means that they never lack for the basic necessities of life.
That’s universal basic income in action. Though they are poor and never work, in survey after survey these ultra-orthodox Jewish men report higher levels of life-satisfaction than any other section of Israeli society. In global surveys of life satisfaction, Israel is almost always at the very top, thanks in part to the contribution of these unemployed deep players.
 You don’t need to go all the way to Israel to see the world of post-work. If you have at home a teenage son who likes computer games, you can conduct your own experiment. Provide him with a minimum subsidy of coke and pizza, and then remove all demands for work and all parental supervision. The likely outcome is that he will remain in his room for days, glued to the screen. He won’t do any homework or housework, will skip school, skip meals, and even skip showers and sleep. Yet he is unlikely to suffer from boredom or a sense of purposelessness. At least not in the short-term.
 Hence virtual realities are likely to be key to providing meaning to the useless class of the post-work world. Maybe these virtual realities will be generated inside computers. Maybe they will be generated outside computers, in the shape of new religions and ideologies. Maybe it will be a combination of the two. The possibilities are endless, and nobody knows for sure what kind of deep plays will engage us in 2050.
In any case, the end of work will not necessarily mean the end of meaning, because meaning is generated by imagining rather than by working. Work is essential for meaning only according to some ideologies and lifestyles. Eighteenth-century English country squires, present-day ultra-orthodox Jews, and children in all cultures and eras have found a lot of interest and meaning in life even without working. People in 2050 will probably be able to play deeper games and to construct more complex virtual worlds than in any previous time in history.
 But what about truth? What about reality? Do we really want to live in a world in which billions of people are immersed in fantasies, pursuing make-believe goals and obeying imaginary laws? Well, like it or not, that’s the world we have been living in for thousands of years already.
The gap was down to two lengths at the line, Rhododendron having powered past the third-placed Daban, but the winner had kept on too gamely, having had a trouble-free run up the centre of the track. Moore said “yes” when asked if he had been unlucky in running but stopped short of claiming he ought to have won.
Asked what would have happened if he’d had a clear run, the jockey replied: “I don’t know. She travelled beautifully and just when I needed to be making my run, I ran out of room at an important stage. She obviously ran a very good race and the winner’s a very good horse as well. I think they’re two good fillies.”
Moore’s weekend may have ended in frustration but he can still look forward to riding both Guineas winners in their future races. O’Brien, meanwhile, was completing a double in the Newmarket Classics for the third time in his career. He ran horses in five Group races here over the weekend, winning four and coming up just a neck short in the other.
For this 27th success in a British Classic, he has to be grateful for the retirement last year of David Wachman, who trained Winter as a juvenile.
Wachman, who won this race with Legatissimo two years ago, may now have some regrets about bowing out, though Michael Tabor, part-owner of Winter, doubted that.
“I think he’d be pleased as punch, knowing David,” Tabor said. “He’s a team player and if he wanted to train this year, he would be training her. But he’s got other ambitions, which I understand, and good luck to him.”
Another consequence of Wachman’s departure is that his jockey, Wayne Lordan, now works full time for O’Brien and achieved his first Classic success aboard Winter. Previously best known in Britain for winning top-class sprints on Sole Power and Slade Power, the 35-year-old adds significant depth to the roster of jockeys at Ballydoyle.
O’Brien’s mind must already be switching gears for the task of producing a credible Derby contender, with Epsom less than four weeks away. He surely cannot look to any of his three colts which took part in the Leopardstown trial on Sunday and were separated by just a neck at the line. “I don’t know if the Derby winner’s there,” Tabor said.
Tabor seems interested in the possibility of sending Churchill to Epsom but that would run counter to the established Ballydoyle modus operandi. There is a lot of stallion potential in a star miler and why ruin that by stretching him out to the Derby distance? O’Brien didn’t do that with Gleneagles two years ago and seems unlikely to do it this time, especially if he can win one of the trials over the next fortnight. Cliffs Of Moher looks a candidate if he lands Chester’s Dee Stakes on Friday.
Richard Hannon said here that his 2,000 Guineas runner-up, Barney Roy, is unlikely to be aimed at the Derby, despite appearing third in betting lists. The final decision will be made by Godolphin but the trainer expects to aim the colt at the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.
ITV Racing appear to have had a good weekend. Their 2,000 Guineas programme on Saturday achieved a peak viewing figure of 800,000, the broadcaster reported, compared to 610,000 on Channel 4 last year, when the race was a week earlier. This year’s average of 578,000 was up from 355,000 last year.

When my own son, then aged 12, started asking on Sunday nights, “Was that a weekend? Are you kidding?” I knew what he meant. In my family of four, weekends had become as gridlocked as weekdays. My husband and I were shuttling the kids to sports and playdates, cleaning and fixing our old, broken house, doing the washing – in short, tackling all the tasks neglected during the time-crunched week of a two-career household. And in between, we were scheduling pockets of work. What my son was mourning wasn’t the end of a great weekend, but the fact that those two days hadn’t seemed like a weekend at all; they were barely distinguishable from the five days before it.
The other culprit is the thing in your hand that you may be reading this on. Technology binds us to work, and we move through our weekends as if on call, checking email and asserting our loyalty – and importance – by engaging with work. No one wants to look less than totally available in fragile economic times.
Of course, we shop because it’s fun. Shopping has been shown to release dopamine, a hit of instant gratification. This is “passive leisure”, and if we are lucky enough to get time off at the weekend, because we are stressed and overworked, we may be inclined to veg out and binge-watch box sets or tuck into the football marathon, decompressing mindlessly. These impulses sometimes deserve indulging, but the satisfactions are often fleeting.
Many parents feel the pressure to cultivate the perfect weekend – to engineer the perfect childhood
Even though she is exhausted and a little miserable, my friend is praised for her hard work. The Protestant mindset has a firm grip in the culture: live to work, not work to live. We get competitive about our busyness (“I stayed until 9pm!” “I stayed until 10pm!”) because it makes us look wanted and worthy – supply and demand. It is hard to shake the ingrained value that time must be utilitarian and occupied, which is why taking two days off can seem suspect, or a bit like failure.
This more-faster-better mode slips into our family lives, too. Many parents feel pressured to cultivate the perfect weekend as part of an overall effort to engineer the perfect childhood. So our children spend their weekends being lugged from enriching course to high-level sport to a scheduled 90-minute visit with other toddlers while the parents limply hang about the edges of the room. Such problems are a privilege, of course, but it can be hard to resist the madness. How can we not register Charlotte for Mandarin when everyone else is doing it? The fear of falling behind is a powerful force working against leisure. But reclaiming unoccupied time at the weekend may be the most successful parenting strategy of all. In boredom and spontaneity, our kids figure out who they are. Unstructured play brings creativity and joy, while overscheduled kids become anxious young adults.
Since my son’s bemoaning of the weekend, our family has become better at declaring certain weekend days “off”. If I need to work, I try to put a clock on it – a few hours, no more – so it doesn’t drift, consuming those two precious days. We do some shopping and cleaning in the week, or – better – declare a perfect home impossible and live with mess. We try to turn off the devices, and visit the people we love.
We don’t always succeed. I still fall into a Twitter hole, or a kid’s football tournament takes over. Protecting the weekend requires vigilance. The goal is that every weekend includes at least a little unoccupied time, devoid of economic compulsion, to see what might happen. In childhood, those open weekends allowed me to stumble towards myself. Later, the kid with the tape recorder became a film critic, and a writer. My weekends revealed who I was, just as our crunched, chaotic ones tell us more about who we are than we might like to know.
At least the ensuing war of words and public emotion shows that both sides realise just how much is at stake. The truth is that the upcoming negotiations will be incredibly complicated, for both technical and political reasons.
For example, how can we deal with the land border in Ireland? The new arrangements will have major implications for business and trade but also for the hundreds of thousands of people in the north with a passport from the republic. Nearly 20,000 workers commute across the border. These are not technical issues but questions with far-reaching political consequences, including for the peace process.
And Northern Ireland is only one of many such issues, where technical complexity meets political tension. Perhaps most important is the need to reach a deal that defines the rights of expats on both sides. But which rights should these migrants keep? A British citizen living in Spain currently has the right to vote in local elections. Should this be preserved? What about the French student who pays domestic rates at a London university? And how do we process the pension rights accrued by a Polish worker who spends six years in the UK but then leaves? The EU has mechanisms for these situations, and lives were planned around the existing rules.
Whatever the agreement on citizens’ rights, they must be enforceable and protected. So who will watch over them, and what will be the relevant jurisdiction? Theresa May talks of escaping oversight by the European court of justice (ECJ), while the EU wants the ECJ to adjudicate. All of these questions are technically fraught and politically charged, but both sides have repeatedly insisted that citizens’ rights are a priority. So now they must deliver. The UK and European public rightly expect politicians to sort out the mess and minimise the damage to people’s lives.
A second issue is future trade relationships. On a technical level, this should actually be easy to agree. We are not talking about a trade deal between two vastly different economies: on the contrary, the Great Repeal Act will translate the current body of EU law into British law. Thus, on the day of Brexit, standards and regulations will essentially be identical. The questions here are whether either side imposes tariffs, and how to deal with future regulatory divergence. These are standard topics, often negotiated in trade agreements, and they are less complex than the fine detail of migrant citizens’ lives.
With political will, a sensible trade agreement is in reach. A deal that primarily covers goods, rather than investment and services, could easily be passed on the EU side. More elaborate agreements would require unanimity, and the recent near-collapse of the EU-Canada Ceta agreement shows that this can be tricky to achieve. But still, it is in both sides’ interest to avoid a no-deal scenario and a fallback to WTO rules.
A final big issue is the infamous “Brexit bill”. Although economically insignificant, politically this might be the most toxic issue. It is important to understand that even a sum of €60bn would not be at all threatening to the UK’s economic fortunes – it is around 3% of UK GDP, and it would be spread over a number of years. But for politicians the bill is extremely explosive, mostly because of the emotional headlines it will trigger on both sides.
After Brexit, economic and political links between the EU and the UK will be weaker. But the UK will still be the EU’s closest neighbour and an important ally. It is time to discuss in earnest how to soften the damage of Brexit for citizens and business on both sides. And it is time to explore how to structure future cooperation in fighting terrorism. Brexit will not be a success, but aiming for failure serves no one. Goodwill and a sense of perspective are the way to protect the EU and UK alike.

Fernando Gaviria claimed his first Grand Tour stage victory as what looked like being the most straightforward day of the 100th Giro d’Italia blew apart in howling winds in Sardinia.
Gaviria took the stage win and the race leader’s pink jersey after the Colombian’s QuickStep-Floors team led the decisive break when echelons split through the peloton on the final approach to Cagliari.
A bunch sprint had been expected at the end of the short, flat 148km stage from Tortoli, but the peloton was buffeted by winds reaching 40km per hour in the final 30km. As the road changed direction several times, the winds turned from crosswinds to headwinds again and again, splitting the pack apart and meaning only four riders crossed the line on the same time as Gaviria.
Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas fought gamely to join the QuickStep-led escape before dropping back, but he finished with the main contenders to sit 11th overall, 23 seconds down on Gaviria.
The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”
This system is deemed to be democratic because people elect governments and can always vote them out; it’s capitalist because corporations are constrained by the logic of competition, which prizes efficiency, innovation and infinite expansion. That logic, with its penchant for creative destruction of all things stale and permanent, can produce toxic results – which is precisely why government action is needed. Such, at any rate, is the social democratic consensus accepted by both centre-left and centre-right parties.
The questions of war and security – and the existential imperatives that they impose on the most democratic of societies – have always posed unresolved challenges to this framework, as can be glimpsed from occasional warnings about the military-industrial complex expressed by many a political insider nearing retirement. Thus, standard democratic procedures are regularly suspended as governments demand tighter control over the flow of information, classify more of their internal communications and expand surveillance without any requisite checks and balances.
The standard critique of such practices attacks the undemocratic-because-unaccountable activities of the so-called “deep state”. Rooted in campaigns to defend privacy, opponents aim to make the deep state shallower – ideally by means of legal interventions aimed at restoring transparency and accountability. The real problem, they argue, is with the malfunctioning of democracy – we could easily ignore the capitalist part of “democratic capitalism”: we just need more and better legal instruments to tame the intelligence agencies.
Governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies – they are engaging in toxic activities of their own
Alas, the world in 2017 is not so easy to pigeonhole into the neat compartments of this scheme. Consider just one example: cyber-security. Plenty of rogue states are, indeed, busy hacking the servers of their adversaries in western Europe or North America. Likewise, there’s no denying that non-state hackers, operating for commercial or patriotic motives, have damaged their targets.
They do this for motives that some might view as noble: to identify early signs of terrorist activity, to track down criminals, to disable devices that might be part of sophisticated plots to wreak havoc on our cities. Whatever the motives, we should not lose sight of the larger political effects produced by such actions.
First, the expansion (and even the maintenance) of the surveillance capabilities of democratic governments presupposes a permanent structural insecurity of our communication networks. That insecurity, in turn, gets exploited not just by democratic governments but by anyone else, including all those rogue states and non-state hackers. However, once insecurity is structural, the right response is not more security, but more insurance. This explains why cyber-insurance has become one of the most promising segments of the insurance market, with even sectors like manufacturing (itself increasingly wired up and interconnected) needing to spend more and more to insure against disruptive cyber-attacks.
In essence, cyber-insurance – like any other form of insurance – is a domain of rentiers who are keen to extract a regular premium payment from those needing their services. The truly innovative element here is that the risk that creates this new class of rentiers exists partly – and, one could even say, mostly – because of government activity.
Here, the logic of democratic capitalism is no more: governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies; rather, they engage in toxic activities of their own, which companies mitigate with activities that are either more or less toxic – depending on one’s views about the parasitic nature of economic activities pursued by rentiers. The second political effect of the ever-expanding surveillance apparatus is the disadvantage it creates for small companies and non-profits, not to mention individuals. Remember the early utopian vision of a digital world, where we would all be running our own mail servers and, with time, might even master our own version of the connected home?
Well, today we demand more autonomy at our own risk: given the sophistication of cyber-attacks – which both aim to steal data and overwhelm sites with fake traffic – it’s obvious that the only actors capable of defending ordinary users, be they individuals or corporations, are big tech firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This, too, violates the basic premise of democratic capitalism: citizens are encouraged to seek protection from companies, not governments.
When both spam and security threats are assessed using the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, one can forget about any other, smaller player being able to compete with such firms that use the structural insecurity created by governments to further consolidate their near-monopoly status.
Democratic capitalism is thus always democratic monopoly capitalism – and even more so in its digital version. The idea that the normal imperatives of capitalist competition would exert extra pressure on digital giants seems quaint. There’s no garage big enough to house a startup that can unseat Google, not with its trove of customer data and artificial intelligence.
The third effect of this new post-democratic compromise is that, in presenting cyber-insecurity as a natural rather than human-made problem, it delegitimises the role of law – and politics in general – in mitigating conflicts between citizens and corporations. Consider how we deal with other types of disasters. It would be imprudent to rely on the power of law and politics to ward off floods and earthquakes; insurance, under these conditions, is not an unreasonable option. But none of this prevents us from requiring stricter building standards so as to minimise the damage when the disaster does strike.
The world of cyber-security does not follow this logic. Imagine if the government regularly dispatched a group of well-paid and well-educated saboteurs to weaken the anti-flood or anti-earthquake defences of our houses, leaving us no option but to turn to the private sector for security, either in the form of better defences or better insurance. This is the situation we are in right now; the only difference is that cyber-security disasters are almost entirely human-made and thus avoidable.
Rhetorically, the governments might even agree that, in the face of all these dangers, we all need to strengthen our privacy laws. In reality, though, we all know that it would only result in them sending even more saboteurs – with even more powerful tools – to weaken our defences. Who, under these conditions, would retain any faith in law and politics, rather than accept protections promised by the market, however flawed and expensive?
Cyber-security, alas, is just one of the many examples where the legitimacy of democratic capitalism – as well as of the social democratic parties that have traditionally defended it – has expired, even if its talking points are still in circulation. No wonder that social democratic parties are collapsing, as elections in the Netherlands and France have shown: they claim to be defending a system that no longer walks the talk.
“I don’t read the newspapers. I don’t have a television at home. I barely knew who Donald Trump was,” Li said during an interview at his agent’s 14-floor studio in a high-rise called Golden Triangle.
Li’s career as a Trump impersonator is still in its infancy; following his debut in Shenzhen he travelled to the nearby city of Zhongshan to perform at the opening of a lighting store and recorded a commercial for a tea company in his home province of Hunan.
Like Trump, Li is a master of bluster and bravado although his is delivered in a thick Hunanese accent. “[I’m] no ordinary person now. I’m a great man... I’m an internet celebrity now!” he boasts.
Ren Shihe, a impressionist from Xi’an who has spent three decades playing everyone from Leonid Brezhnev to Saddam Hussein, said he charged up to 30,000 yuan (£3,400) per appearance.
Zou Danrong, Li’s BMW-driving agent, admitted his Chinese Trump was still a work in progress. In a bid to make his black-haired apprentice more convincing he was trying to teach him to be more effeminate, like the real-life Trump, and planned to buy him some blue contact lenses.
 A well-known talent agent, Zou already represents a range of world leaders including a Kim Jong-un from Hebei province; a Barack Obama from Guangdong and a Vladimir Putin from Anhui.
“In the US people are free to protest and to hold Trump’s photograph upside down. In China no one would dare to do this,” he added. “That’s politics.”

While no one is immune, pollution particularly affects children, whose lungs are still developing. Key culprits are diesel vehicles, followed by gas combustion from boilers and cookers.
Air pollution shares none of the intractable characteristics of problems such as climate change and microbial resistance. Unlike the latter, air pollution, on the whole, respects international borders and does not require the international treaties and agreements that can take years to hammer out.
Cleaning up our air is eminently achievable with the right package of measures. We need a mix of clean air zones that include charging owners of diesel vehicles to drive into densely populated urban areas, a scrappage scheme for diesel cars, a tax system that discourages owners from buying diesel and much tougher European testing.
The government is clearly concerned about proposing any measures that would hit diesel drivers a few weeks before the general election. Yet Thursday’s local election results show it has nothing to fear: barring an electoral earthquake, it is on course for a decisive victory. Votes before lives: that’s Theresa May’s telling choice.
Do they kiss their mommas with those mouths? When interviewed, marchers said that Trump was an “embarrassment” and “unwelcome”. In the end, Trump completed his official engagement and veered back to his New Jersey golf course without even popping in to Trump Tower to see if he could find which cupboard Melania had frantically hidden in this time.
What’s the betting that Trump was sitting in the back of his car pulling his maddest, crossest presidential face – you know, the one that makes him resemble Mount Rushmore before the stonemasons started work?
Only recently, Trump was hinting that being the leader of the free world wasn’t all it was cracked up to be and now this happens.
The people of New York need to take a long hard look at themselves. Anyone would think that the only way that they’d want Trump to take another bite of the Big Apple would be if he instantly choked on it and they got to watch.
I’m a sucker for the American west as seen from a bus and I loved the wild, magical, almost mystical portrayal of the landscape in this coming-of-age road movie by Andrea Arnold. I also loved the tender relationship between the main character, who has run away to join a circus-like group of teenage sales people in the US, and the animals she keeps trying to save. Her familiar longing to save these little creatures from an unpredictable world is almost godlike and echoes the viewer’s desire to see her and her young friends safely delivered to a better future.
Sorry to choose a reissue for the music choice. I have to admit that at some point, I think my late 30s, I decided I had enough music to last me a lifetime and stopped being hungry for new stuff. Music still feels like a lifeline to me but like most other middle aged people, I’d rather listen to music I’m already familiar with. When I left London, I gave away or sold my record collection, most of which was covered in candle wax and jam. I still find it thrilling and the greatest possible luxury to be carrying around all my music in my pocket and be able to find whatever I’m looking for within moments. But I digress. I chose this album because it’s just been rereleased and so counts as something sort-of new. I completely missed Elliott Smith the first time round, I’m not sure how, and was introduced to this album by my husband. It’s now one of my all-time favourites – it’s start-to-finish absolute perfection. I don’t have much tolerance for sad music, but this is gentle and smart and somehow weirdly comforting, and it’s not depressing at all.
I’m so ashamed that I bought the lie that Bernie had no chance of being elected if he won the Democratic nomination. Looking back, I think that was totally wrong. I’ve been ignoring American politics since I’ve lived here, partly because the system seems so messed up and partly because I believed Obama was genuinely a good guy and if he couldn’t do it, it couldn’t be done. Reading this book was a huge eye-opener. I’ve also woken up to the fact that I need to start paying attention and doing what I can. I was just in South Carolina with a friend, helping to register voters for the special election there in June. I hope the extremity of what is happening in the US now gives birth to a truly progressive revolution. The Women’s March was incredible and it’s been heartening to see how many grassroots campaigns are springing up.
Ram Dass was a big-shot Harvard psychology professor in the 60s [under the name Richard Alpert], until he found himself in the office next door to Timothy Leary, which led to drinking the Kool Aid and getting himself very publicly dismissed. In an effort to find a more sustainable high, and to seek the origin of the truth he had glimpsed while taking psychedelics, he traveled to India and found his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. He came back to the US and became one of the archetypal 60s spiritual teachers who spread the teachings of the east to the west. He’s funny and wise and I love him. This book is a recently compiled collection of his writings. Ram Dass is in his eighties now and has lost the ability to speak fluently after suffering a stroke, so this book is read by his pal Rameshwar Das, who does a great job.
The mandate of the outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, officially ends at midnight on Sunday 14 May and he is expected to vacate the Élysée earlier that day.
On Monday 8 May, the interior minister, Matthias Fekl, will officially announce the result of the presidential election. The first results, which came in at 8pm French time (7pm BST) on Sunday evening, are only estimations based on the initial count from several hundred polling stations that closed an hour before.
The handover of power takes place next weekend. The ceremony follows a well-rehearsed form: Macron will go to the Elysée and be received in the courtyard by Hollande. After a brief chat, Hollande will leave the presidential palace accompanied by the Republican Guard.
 Macron’s first engagement as president will be to pay tribute at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior at the Arc de Triomphe and visit Paris city hall.
Of those to be recruited to his government, Macron said: “I will choose them for their experience, their competence, what they have done and not for what they represent or their political weight ...
“They will be people who are important mayors, regional or general council presidents; people who have sometimes been ministers, but who do things and who will be able to run an administration and conduct a public policy.”
For other ministries, he is expected to fish from the Socialist and centre-right Les Républicains pools, luring experienced and respected politicians such as the former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s labour minister Xavier Bertrand from the right and the Lyon mayor, Gérard Collomb, from the left.
Christine Lagarde, the current IMF managing director, has also been mentioned.
Macron supporters gathered around the famous glass pyramid, where they watched the new president-elect give his victory speech at his campaign headquarters the other side of Paris.
A few hours later, he was there in person, looking serious and presidential as he strode across the Louvre courtyard to the stage. “Macron president. Macron president,” they cheered.
“Thank you my friends,” he told them. “What we have done for the last many months has no precedent or equivalent. Everyone said it was not possible but they didn’t know France.”
It was a sombre address for a celebration party. Macron said he accepted many had voted for him even though they disagreed with his programme to “defend the republic against extremism”. “I will protect the republic,” he told the crowd.
Macron said he was aware of the “anger, anxiety and doubt” that many French citizens felt and expressed in their vote. He said he would be “implacable and entirely resolved” in defending their security. “I will defend France, its vital interests, its image,” he said.
His primary task over the coming five years, he added, was to “calm people’s fears, restore France’s confidence, and gather all its people together to face the immense challenges that face us”.
Supporters had begun gathering outside the Louvre late in the afternoon, but security checks meant many people were still outside when the result was announced. The organisers had planned for 10,000 and numbers swelled dramatically as the night drew in.
Despite the party music, live bands, DJ and dancing girls, the crowd often seemed reticent and subdued. Macron’s supporters seemed happy, emotional, but not entirely overjoyed; an atmosphere reflecting the sense that the country had sailed very close to a perilous wind and gone through an experience that had left many traumatised.
 Ben Lounis, 39, a radiologist, who was born in Algeria, had brought his three children to celebrate at the Louvre. As the children, aged between six and 10, waved flags, he said: “I am very satisfied with the result. France has avoided the worst. I feel Mr Macron is an interesting and intelligent young man and I hope he will bring lots of good things to France and the whole world.
“I hope that under him we can find ourselves in a multi-cultural France where we regard each other as human beings. I have three children of mixed race, their mother is French, we live in France and we want to keep living in France. We were afraid of the alternative.”
Kardia, a French citizen who was originally from Burkina Faso, said she was “very happy” with the result. “We need a young president who will change things. For me it’s an important win for our children. The fact he is so young does’t bother me at all. He is just what France needs. A young entrepreneur.”
She said that Le Pen’s place in the election’s second round had made her afraid. “I’ve been in France for 20 years, lived in the US, now I live in Spain. My children are studying, living and working all over the world. I don’t understand this idea of France for the French. We need to have a world view.”
A 40-33 victory for Umaga’s Blues over the NSW Waratahs in Sydney and the Chiefs’ 46-17 thrashing of the Queensland Reds in New Plymouth extended New Zealand’s collective winning streak over Australian teams in the competition to 23 matches – and 17 this season.
Only a massive upset in any of the eight remaining trans-Tasman home-and-away fixtures can deny the Kiwi dominators a 25-0 clean sweep of their Australian counterparts in 2017.
Umaga suspects the ongoing uncertainty around which Australian team will be cut from the competition in 2018 is taking its toll.
“We all know that there’s been some tough things going on over here and not just on the field, obviously off the field, so that’s unsettling,” he said after his Blues consigned the Waratahs to a fourth straight loss at Allianz Stadium for the first time since 1999.
“It’s pretty tough to keep everyone on an even keel when you’re always looking over your shoulder wondering what if and what could happen, and so that’s tough.
“There’s some quality players and staff involved in these groups and they’ll get it back on track, but I suppose what everyone’s looking for is a decision to be made so everyone can know what’s happening. That’s just how it is and we’re taking advantage of that, obviously.”
Asked how the under-performing – but safe – Waratahs and Reds could blame the Sanzaar situation for their on-field woes, Umaga said: “I’m sure they wouldn’t see that as an excuse. It’s just the lay of the land. It’s reality.
“If you talk about players and staff, and the uncertainty of it, it’s like anything; if you’re in employment and you don’t know what’s going to happen from year to year, you can’t say that it’s not unsettling.”
Australia’s struggles aren’t restricted to New Zealand rivals.
The Melbourne Rebels’ 47-10 home loss to the Lions and the Sharks’ 37-12 defeat of the Western Force in Durban leaves Australian franchises with just three wins from 31 matches against all overseas opposition this campaign.
The Kiwis also continue to rule South Africa, with the unbeaten Crusaders’ 62-24 rout of the Bulls in Pretoria completing another weekend sweep for the powerful New Zealand conference.
The Hurricanes came from behind late to see off the Stormers 41-22 in Wellington, but the titleholders’ comeback paled into comparison to the Highlanders’ against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein.
The 2015 champions trailed by 17 points before piling on three tries in the last five minutes to snatch a 45-41 victory. In the final match of round 11, the Jaguares edged the Sunwolves 46-39 in a high-scoring thriller in Buenos Aires.
The gap was down to two lengths at the line, Rhododendron having powered past the third-placed Daban, but the winner had kept on too gamely, having had a trouble-free run up the centre of the track. Moore said “yes” when asked if he had been unlucky in running but stopped short of claiming he ought to have won.
Asked what would have happened if he’d had a clear run, the jockey replied: “I don’t know. She travelled beautifully and just when I needed to be making my run, I ran out of room at an important stage. She obviously ran a very good race and the winner’s a very good horse as well. I think they’re two good fillies.”
Moore’s weekend may have ended in frustration but he can still look forward to riding both Guineas winners in their future races. O’Brien, meanwhile, was completing a double in the Newmarket Classics for the third time in his career. He ran horses in five Group races here over the weekend, winning four and coming up just a neck short in the other.
For this 27th success in a British Classic, he has to be grateful for the retirement last year of David Wachman, who trained Winter as a juvenile.
Wachman, who won this race with Legatissimo two years ago, may now have some regrets about bowing out, though Michael Tabor, part-owner of Winter, doubted that.
“I think he’d be pleased as punch, knowing David,” Tabor said. “He’s a team player and if he wanted to train this year, he would be training her. But he’s got other ambitions, which I understand, and good luck to him.”
Another consequence of Wachman’s departure is that his jockey, Wayne Lordan, now works full time for O’Brien and achieved his first Classic success aboard Winter. Previously best known in Britain for winning top-class sprints on Sole Power and Slade Power, the 35-year-old adds significant depth to the roster of jockeys at Ballydoyle.
O’Brien’s mind must already be switching gears for the task of producing a credible Derby contender, with Epsom less than four weeks away. He surely cannot look to any of his three colts which took part in the Leopardstown trial on Sunday and were separated by just a neck at the line. “I don’t know if the Derby winner’s there,” Tabor said.
Tabor seems interested in the possibility of sending Churchill to Epsom but that would run counter to the established Ballydoyle modus operandi. There is a lot of stallion potential in a star miler and why ruin that by stretching him out to the Derby distance? O’Brien didn’t do that with Gleneagles two years ago and seems unlikely to do it this time, especially if he can win one of the trials over the next fortnight. Cliffs Of Moher looks a candidate if he lands Chester’s Dee Stakes on Friday.
Richard Hannon said here that his 2,000 Guineas runner-up, Barney Roy, is unlikely to be aimed at the Derby, despite appearing third in betting lists. The final decision will be made by Godolphin but the trainer expects to aim the colt at the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.
ITV Racing appear to have had a good weekend. Their 2,000 Guineas programme on Saturday achieved a peak viewing figure of 800,000, the broadcaster reported, compared to 610,000 on Channel 4 last year, when the race was a week earlier. This year’s average of 578,000 was up from 355,000 last year.

It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened
But it’s Monday morning, he’s just woken up, and he’s in no mood to enter that headspace. When I remark that the album has more darkness and meditations on mortality, he yawns and says, “Maybe, I dunno. Maybe I was just being a jackass.” Has he picked up any adult life skills recently? “Uh I don’t think I have very many… fuck. Ummm. I learned how to wipe my own ass last week,” he guffaws (the joke is later reprised several times). His preferred way of starting an answer is “I dunno”.
Two sides coexist in the DeMarco universe: one laid-back and sunny, one more introspective. A casual listen to the album doesn’t immediately reveal the ruminations within: the music sounds upbeat and melodic, there are odes to love (inspired by his long-term girlfriend), guitars twang serenely. Yet, DeMarco’s father looms large throughout. In opener My Old Man, DeMarco sings about becoming more like his father – “Uh-oh, looks like I’m seeing more of my old man in me” – a relatable-enough sentiment, made more touching by the knowledge that his father is an alcoholic and an addict whom he hardly knows.
Nevertheless, he warns against taking this too literally. “Anytime I see myself becoming something that I don’t necessarily agree with, that’s kind of what I’m talking about there, I guess,” he says. “But that can be taken in several different ways. Take it like a trope or whatever. It doesn’t matter – it’s a pop song.”
The album was written months ago, when his father had become very ill: the last song goes: “The thought of him no longer being around / Well sure it would be sad but not really different / And even though we barely know each other / It still hurts watching him fade away.” Although his father’s health has now improved, the two are still not in touch. Did exploring these issues on the album change the way he views his father? “Um, no. I mean, I was trying to understand it. But I don’t know, I really don’t. It just solidified [the fact] that I don’t understand.”
A much happier relationship is with his girlfriend, Kiera McNally. They met aged 14, got together five years later, and are still together seven years on (“almost eight”, she chirps in the background). The album’s love songs are varied – some are about past fights (“I never meant to make her cry”), some about fluctuations of affection (“sometimes my heart may seem awful cold”), one harks back to the feeling of “seeing her for the first time”, others are inspired by emotions from the distant past.
Considering that a lot of music is about break-ups or falling in love, is it harder to find inspiration in a contented, settled relationship? “It still comes,” he says. “I think that just being in love – being out of love, being in love, being confused by love, wanting love, not wanting love, being scared of love – it doesn’t matter which. There are so many things better than feeling nothing at all. Long-term relationships are like a fucking mountainscape, you know? Things go up, things go down. That’s the fun of it.” What’s his top relationship advice? “Be kind. Be respectful. And be real.”
DeMarco has always railed against the “cool guy fantasy” of rock stars being separate from fans: “the idea of that sexy guy in the band, dark and tall and handsome, looking at his shoes like, ‘Don’t talk to me’ – that has been so unappealing to me for ever.” Most of the fans he encounters are excitable young kids, with the occasional surprise. “It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened a couple times.”
But he also likes to throw curveballs about his life into the mix: he told one interviewer that Kiera has sadly passed away; he informed an audience they had broken up. Recently he said in an interview that he had become a father, prompting family members to get in touch to congratulate him; his mother said it almost gave her a heart attack. “The whole thing with the internet,” he says with a groan, “it’s the wild west. People read into things too much – it’s all horseshit and I like to treat it that way and have fun with it.”
I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth – it’s so twisted
He’s unlikely to repeat the experiment in his new place. He has just bought his first house, which made him feel “kind of weird and old”, after moving from New York to Los Angeles last August (“No real reason why – it just seemed a happening place, so it was like, ‘let’s go give it a shot’”). Now that he’s in LA, has he started to see the appeal of yoga and juice cleanses? “Nah, I don’t think so. I don’t like a juice, I like a smoothie, I like the chunkiness – a smoothie is halfway to a milkshake, and I’d have milkshakes every day if I could.”
It isn’t easy to get a strong opinion out of DeMarco, prime purveyor of contemporary slacker rock (in terms of sound rather than work ethic). What makes him angry? “I don’t get genuinely angry very easily. I don’t know. A whole number of different things. It’s hard to pinpoint what.” I try to stir him up a little. What does he think of life under Trump? “A lot of people are really put out, sad, disappointed… but I dunno. It’s not that it’s not my place to talk about American politics, but it’s a little complicated.” How worried is he about nuclear war? “If we got nuked I’d probably be fried before I even noticed it, which would suck, but would I know? Hopefully nuclear war doesn’t happen, that would really blow ass.”
How does he feel about social media? “It’s bizarre, but I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth. Kids have been led to believe that the number of likes you get on a post or something is equal to your popularity or how cool you are – it’s so twisted and evil. It’s really fucked up and scary, and it’s getting scarier.” He does have Twitter and Instagram accounts but rarely touches them; one of his most recent tweets, from last October, simply reads “#jarjarbinks”.
Social media has also meant that footage of his wilder live shows – nudity, drinking, a notorious incident involving a drumstick – live on online. “When those kinds of things happen it’s usually because I’ve had an off show,” he says. “What I try to focus on is try and play as well as I can and make sure everybody’s happy.”
Until then, does he have any pearls of wisdom to impart? “Nah, I’m good,” he says. “Just tell everybody to brush their teeth twice a day – keep it fresh.”
Mac DeMarco’s album This Old Dog is out now on Captured Tracks. He plays two sold-out nights at the O2 Academy Brixton, London SW9, on 30 and 31 May
But these new ambulances, equipped with sirens and a doctor on board, will exclusively serve injured cows, in the latest of a series of high-profile schemes to improve the wellbeing of the animals, which are revered by most Hindus.
He said the ambulance service had received about 200 calls and was able to attend to about 25 cows a day.
For the past 20 years the trust has been running a similar low-cost ambulance service for rickshaw pullers and rural labourers, and it added cow welfare to its agenda in the past two years.
Sanjay Rai,chief trustee, said he had been interested in helping to protect cows for nearly a decade but had lacked financial resources to establish an ambulance service. “And there was no support from the government side,” he said.
The new state administration of Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu revivalist, has been more encouraging and had allocated the ambulance service a toll-free number, he said. “On a verbal basis they support us, but for financial support they have not started anything yet,” Rai said.
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, won office in 2014 campaigning for a national ban on cow slaughter, and under his tenure there has been a surge in projects to improve the animal’s welfare.
The other side of the growing zeal to protect cows is increasing violence against those perceived to be harming them. In Rajasthan last month a dairy farmer, Pehlu Khan, was attacked by a mob and died from his injuries after being caught transporting cattle.
Movements to protect the cow first became prominent in India in the late 19th century, accompanying a growing political consciousness among Hindus. The issue has frequently been a trigger for tension with India’s sizeable Muslim minority, and has become increasingly charged since Modi’s election in 2014.
Most Hindus eschew beef, but the meat is consumed by some in the country’s south, by many of India’s religious minorities, and by traditionally poorer castes who regard the animal as a cheap source of protein.
Critics of Modi and the broader Hindu nationalist movement argue the threat to cows is overblown and that the animal’s welfare is being used to whip up anti-Islamic sentiment among the Hindu majority.
“The prime minister warmly congratulates president-elect Macron on his election success,” the statement said. “France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities.”
While Marine Le Pen was projected to take about 11m votes, double her father’s score in 2002, it was clearly satisfying to many leaders that the far right appeared unable to get above the 40% mark, which some feared would be breached.
“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité! France chose that today. The great nation was, is, and remains in the middle and at the heart of Europe,” wrote Gabriel on Twitter, using France’s national slogan.
Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!
Chinese President Xi Jinping also congratulated the victor, saying China and France shared a “responsibility toward peace and development in the world.”
“China stands ready to work with France to move the strategic Sino-French partnership to a higher level,” he said according to Xinhua news agency.
“It may be too early to conclude that today’s peak of popularism in world politics is beginning to wane,” the nationalist newspaper said.
“Years later when we look back upon this election, we may find that France made a wise choice for human civilisation in helping to keep it moving forward at such a crucial time, rather than setting it back,” it said.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau telephoned Emmanuel Macron to congratulate him.
“I look forward to working closely with President-elect Macron in the years ahead as we work together on a progressive agenda to promote international security, increase collaboration in science and technology, and create good, middle class jobs on both sides of the Atlantic,” he said in a statement earlier.
Highlighting the cooperation between French and Australian soldiers during World War I, he added: “We have been side-by-side in freedom’s cause for over a century, and we are side-by-side in freedom’s cause in the Middle East today. So we have great work to do to make the ties between France and Australia stronger still.”
Not only did the result come as a significant relief for the European commission, but it will be seen by some in Brussels as a vindication of the EU executive’s unprecedented backing for a candidate in a domestic election. The decision to not comment during the Brexit referendum in the UK, and the question of whether that had been the right way forward, had weighed heavily on officials’ minds in Brussels.
Responding to Sunday’s result, Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party, the largest group in the European parliament, of which Merkel and Juncker are members, expressed the relief felt by many at the result and its wider ramifications. “The election shows that people are ready to fight against extremism and populism,” he said. “For all those who think that France can only be strong in a strong Europe and that Europe needs France to be self-confident and sure of its assets, this result is an immense relief.”
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, and now the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “Congratulations to President @EmmanuelMacron! Everyone is looking to #France now to take the lead in a New Deal for Europe.”
Macron is said to be planning to promote democratic conventions in every member state in order to gauge the type of EU citizens are seeking.
He also made public his desire for the 73 seats currently held by UK MEPs to be transferred to a trans-national European list in a symbolic show of support for further pan-European cooperation.
Indeed while Downing Street welcomed the result, the British government may reasonably harbour some concerns about what the result will mean for the Brexit negotiations.
William talks of his “pain” and “shock”, plus “the humiliation heaped on his wife”. What he doesn’t explain, though, is why it’s necessary to revive all that pain and angst half a decade later – especially since, quite clinically, no French court is going to award him more than a (perhaps humiliating) fraction of the damages he seeks.
A future monarch needs a better legal advice team. Or maybe just have a word with the Duke of Edinburgh before he goes.
The artwork emerged overnight on the Castle Amusements building near the ferry terminal, which connects the UK with mainland Europe.
The mural, which was confirmed by Banksy’s representatives to be a genuine work by the elusive artist, is his first comment on the Brexit vote last year.
Indonesian authorities have said about 200 inmates remain at large two days after a mass escape from an overcrowded prison on Sumatra island.
The breakout at Sialang Bungkuk prison in Pekanbaru on Friday occurred when prisoners were let out of their cells to perform prayers. They broke through a prison door, overwhelming the few guards on duty.
Police said 242 men had been recaptured by Sunday morning, leaving about 200 still at large.
Authorities were initially uncertain how many prisoners had escaped, estimating the numbers at between 100 and 300.
Police said some of the men surrendered or were returned by their families and others were captured by local residents, police and soldiers.
Various officials have said the prisoners were angry about poor conditions and treatment. The prison has a capacity of about 360 but was holding more than 1,870 men, according to a local police spokesman, Guntur Aryo Tejo.
Tejo said four of the escaped inmates were apprehended by police late on Friday about 60 miles from the prison, on a bus heading for West Sumatra province.
Hundreds of police and soldiers have been deployed in the hunt for the prisoners.
Friday’s escape was the biggest since July 2013 when about 240 prisoners, including several convicted terrorists, escaped after a deadly riot at a prison in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province.
General manager Sandy Alderson announced the suspension in a brief statement before the game, saying that Harvey had been sent home but declining further comment. The team said the suspension was effective Saturday.
“We are going to keep it in house, the way it’s supposed to be,” manager Terry Collins said. “We hope to put it behind us and move forward.”
Left-hander Adam Wilk was called up from Triple-A Las Vegas to start in Harvey’s place. The three-day suspension removes Harvey from the 25-man roster. The Mets transferred Noah Syndergaard to the 60-day disabled list to open a spot on the 40-man roster for Wilk.
Collins indicated that he was aware that a suspension could be on the horizon for Harvey.
“There were some moves made last night because we felt this might occur,” he said.
In his first season after having a rib removed to treat thoracic outlet syndrome, the 28-year-old Harvey has struggled to a 2-2 record with a 5.14 ERA over 35 innings. Harvey is coming off two of the worst starts of his career, allowing 12 runs over 9 2/3 innings with eight walks in a pair of losses to Atlanta.
He missed the 2014 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Harvey’s best season was in 2015, when he went 13-8 with a 2.71 ERA. But that year, in his first postseason, he missed a mandatory workout the day before the NL East champion Mets traveled to Los Angeles for their playoff opener against the Dodgers. He apologized for his late arrival, for which he was fined. Harvey offered no public explanation for his tardiness, saying he simply “screwed up.”
Harvey’s suspension is the latest blow for the Mets, who have been plagued with injuries this season. New York is missing ace right-hander Syndergaard (latissimus dorsi), outfielder Yoenis Cespedes (hamstring), first baseman Lucas Duda (elbow), catcher Travis d’Arnaud (wrist), left-hander Steven Matz (elbow), right-hander Seth Lugo (elbow), third baseman David Wright (recovery from neck surgery) and outfielder Brandon Nimmo (hamstring). Shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera left Saturday’s game with an injured left thumb.
The team already has dealt with several public relations issues this season. Syndergaard initially missed a start with what the Mets said was biceps and shoulder discomfort and then made his next start against Washington after refusing to undergo an MRI. He was removed with the lat injury after only 11 batters. Syndergaard issued an apology Saturday to Mets public relations director Jay Horowitz and to members of the media for an outburst on April 27.
Backup catcher Kevin Plawecki was at the center of a controversy Friday when a sex toy could be viewed in his locker in a photo the Mets tweeted of T.J. Rivera wearing the star-of-the-game crown after New York’s come-from-behind victory.
Collins had a closed-door meeting with the team to address the situation, which Plawecki described as a prank.
Africa is home to 1.2 billion people, but by 2050 that number is likely to double, and may well double again by the end of the century to reach well over 4 billion. Globally, we may exceed 11 billion souls. This is of course a cause for celebration and a testament to the huge strides we’ve made in public health. We’ve all but beaten polio and yellow fever, mother and child mortality has plummeted, and we’re making headway in the fight against malaria.
Another cause for celebration is the confidence, energy and entrepreneurship in many parts of the African continent – a spirit that is unmatched anywhere in the world. It’s easy to see we’re on the cusp of enormous positive change.
The obvious flipside is the environmental disaster waiting to happen. This has been compounded by number crunchers who are leaving the future of our planet’s fragile ecosystems out of the equation as they try to come up with answers about how to fill billions of bellies. Several scenarios for cropland expansion – many of them focusing on Africa’s so-called “spare land” – have already effectively written off its elephants from having a future in the wild.
These projections have earmarked a huge swathe of land spanning from Nigeria to South Sudan for farming, or parts of west Africa for conversion to palm oil plantations. Economies are already being structured for the future, and are locking us into an unsustainable path to the tune of Feed the World – but with Africa providing the food.
But we can change this trajectory if we act now on three clear solutions – and even bring about a win-win scenario in which Africa’s future generations come out on top thanks to healthy ecosystems.
The first is better land-use planning; setting clear boundaries and limits on urban development and farming. The benefit here is that when constrained, we innovate. Land use becomes more considered and more efficient.
The second is agricultural yield – looking at food production in the sub-Saharan region and comparing it to, for example, the European Union, we can clearly see room for huge gains. With the right investment, yields could potentially double. Better choices and technology will remove the temptation simply to plough more land.
We have to see conservation not as a cost or a burden, but rather as an investment in our own survival
Third, we need conservation areas that generate tangible benefits for the people who live alongside wildlife, creating real, localised green economies that can secure local buy-in. Namibia has made great strides in providing for community-owned land outside national parks, while Kenya’s recent conservancies law creates a more robust framework for communities to protect and profit.
Most of all, we have to see conservation not as a cost or a burden, but rather as a business opportunity and an investment in our own survival. This is an argument I’ve carried with me into climate negotiations, where for years we’ve been disagreeing about who should foot the bill. At last we’re beginning to see an inclusive green economy and a shift to technologies like renewables as a bounty. These changes can be drivers of a better quality of life, better paid jobs, and a growth potential of decades.
Human wellbeing and the survival of our ecosystems are inextricably linked. The health of Africa’s elephants – a keystone species upon which countless others depend – serves as a barometer of not just the state of the environment, but also our prospects as a species. Simply put, we need to secure the space for both.

State media reports said Xie stood accused of “inciting state subversion” - an offence defined by the country’s criminal law as an attempt to subvert state power or overthrow the socialist system by spreading “rumours or slanders”. The crime carries a possible sentence of up to five years although those considered to be “ringleaders” or to have committed “grave crimes” could face longer jail terms.
Teng described the trials of Xie and other civil rights lawyers as a politically-driven attempt to wipe out opposition to the Communist party at a time of “political, economic and ideological crisis”.
“I feel very sad and very angry,” Teng said by phone from his home in New Jersey where he lives in exile with his wife and daughter.
“These people should be respected by all Chinese people but what the government has done is totally unacceptable and goes against [people’s] fundamental human rights.”

The go-ahead for the nation state bill by the ministerial committee for legislation means it will now move forward to a vote by the country’s parliament. The bill has to pass several stages in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for it to become law and could also be challenged in the courts.
Critics say the law is discriminatory and could undermine Israel’s balance of being both a Jewish and democratic state by harming the rights of minorities.
Hebrew and Arabic are both Israel’s national languages, but the bill states that Hebrew would be the lone national language, downgrading Arabic to “a special status in the state” whose “speakers have the right to language-accessible state services”.
The legislation is designed to be enshrined in Israel’s basic law, regarded as the closest approximation in Israel to a constitution.
The timing of the bill – after four years of deliberations – is significant, coming two weeks before a planned visit by Donald Trump in which the US president had hoped to breath life into a moribund peace process.
Although the bill has undergone some changes in the drafting process – not least removing language that would have seen Israel’s democracy subordinated in importance to its Jewish identity – it remains highly contentious.
While the way Israel’s legislative process functions has long allowed parties and individuals to put forward legislation likely to be challenged by the courts, the latest proposed law comes in the context of Israel’s most rightwing ever government.
The committee approved the bill unanimously but the measure has been condemned by opposition politicians, academics and in some parts of the Israeli media.
Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, representing Arab-Israeli parties, said the bill was a “declaration of war” on Israel’s Arab citizens. “Discrimination has received a legal stamp. The danger in this law in that it establishes two classes of citizen – Jewish and Arab,” he said.
Erel Margalit, a contender for the leadership of the centrist Zionist Union party, called the bill “reminiscent of dark periods” in history.
Zehava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, said the bill’s intention was to downgrade the rights of non-Jews in Israel. “The result of the Jewish state bill is clear. Jews will get preference over all other citizens, clearly violating human rights, democracy and the rights of the Arab minority in Israel,” she said.
The bill’s sponsor, Avi Dichter, an MP from Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, defended the proposals, as did other ministers.
 ”This is a small step for the Jewish state bill, which establishes that Israel is and will be a Jewish and democratic state, and it’s a big step towards defining our identity, not only in the eyes of the world but primarily for ourselves, Israelis – to be a free people in our land,” said Dichter after the committee’s vote.
He said the bill was necessary because “events of recent months prove that this is a battle for Israel’s image and national identity. The Palestinians no longer hide their goal of erasing the Jewish people’s nation state”.
The legislative committee’s chairman, Yariv Levin, also a Likud MP, said he had decided to put an end to foot-dragging over the bill. “We’ve been waiting to discuss and make a decision on this legislation for too long. This is a basic law, which has the simple objective of safeguarding Israel’s status as the nation state of the Jewish people. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been made into law so far,” he said.
Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.

Hargreaves, who is now retired after founding the Hargreaves Lansdown financial services company, said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of EU nationals before the delicate negotiations over Brexit. However, he said, May should simply “make the gesture” and not wait until Brussels agreed to do the same for UK nationals living in EU states.
It coincides with concern among some senior Brexit backers over May’s approach to immigration after Brexit.
Hargreaves said he was happy to see EU nationals already here maintain their current rights. “Most of those are in work and adding to our economy,” he said. “We are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future, but I think there should have been that comfort given, because they came under different circumstances.”
Wolfson said: “While it is important and essential that Britain controls who comes into this country, and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers … it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge.
“We are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war. If we are too draconian on immigration, it will have two adverse effects on our economy. The first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth, and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world.
“The most important thing to come out of Brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world – that Britain is an open country, a free trading country, one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it.”
Marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures, arguing that universities “must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post-Brexit economy”.
“It is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no-brainer to take students out of the migration numbers,” he said.
“Polling of Brexit voters even shows strong support for this change. People in the north and Midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector. They are simply not worried about student migration.”
Jonny Bairstow has done all he can to nudge England towards a rethink of their plans before this summer’s Champions Trophy with his brutal exhibition of hitting and the golden arm of Joe Root setting up an 85-run win over Ireland at Lord’s.
Asked to bat under initial grey skies, England hustled their way to 328 for six with Root and Morgan striking 73 and 76 respectively in a stand of 140 before Bairstow turned on the afterburners at the back end of the innings with an unbeaten 72 from 44 balls.
Facing a target one greater than their famous chase of 328 against the same opposition in Bangalore six years ago, Ireland were bowled out for 243 in 46.1 overs as Root’s off-breaks returned three for 52 and Liam Plunkett took three for 23. Nevertheless, individuals stood up for the supportersin green, with 82 from the captain, William Porterfield, following a brawny 48 by the Middlesex opener Paul Stirling.
Stirling’s initial salvo, one of eight crunched fours and a mighty six over the ridiculously short boundary, was, truth be told, the only time England looked as if they might end up grateful for the late flourish to their own innings, where 61 runs were reaped from the final four overs as Bairstow put on something of a show for the 23,000-strong crowd.
The Yorkshireman is due to be a drinks-carrier when Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler return from the Indian Premier League to face South Africa this month before the summer’s main event. But as he mowed Ireland’s bowlers to all parts his inability to command a regular place seemed all the more baffling. At the very least the position of first reserve ahead of Sam Billings – who was given the gloves ahead of him in Buttler’s absence – has surely been locked down.
Putting on 88 in 7.4 overs with his county team-mate Adil Rashid, who wristily flicked a 25-ball 39 from No7 himself, Bairstow delivered his full repertoire, standing tall with his high backlift and manipulating boundaries through power and placement.
Bar one heart-in-the-mouth moment, when George Dockrell held him on the midwicket rope on 43 only to tumble over and throw the ball back into play, he positively glowed in the form that brought him 1,470 Test runs last year, cracking seven fours as well as three sixes.
After heads understandably dropped in the field on Friday, Ireland’s performance in the field was much sharper. Tim Murtagh got the new ball to nibble first up on his home ground, castling Alex Hales on 32 with one that seamed up the slope, while his fellow right-armer Barry McCarthy – until some late tap from Bairstow – was the pick with two for 61.
Porterfield rotated his attack throughout, making 23 bowling changes in a bid to prevent the home side settling. Settle they did, however, after Hales and Jason Roy fell in the space of three overs – the latter picking out extra cover to make it 60 for two in the 13th – with Morgan and Root then easing to half-centuries at around a run a ball when an England team of old might have consolidated.
Morgan, whose one wobble before eventually chipping McCarthy to extra cover came on 39 when a ball from Stirling’s off-spin trickled on to the stumps without disturbing them, carved the bowlers in typical fashion thereafter, while Root glossily stroked his way to a fifth 50-plus score in seven innings this year before picking out mid-off.
England struggled early in the reply – not least David Willey, who saw his three overs with the new ball crashed for 23 runs and did not return – but after Jake Ball removed Stirling in the 14th over, thanks to a faint snick behind picked up on review, the second innings belonged to Root, who bowled the full allocation for the first time in his one-day career.
Castling Ed Joyce with a sliding round-arm delivery for 16, and then getting Niall O’Brien and Gary Wilson held in the deep, Root’s form with the ball may be the best way for his fellow Yorkshireman, Bairstow, to be retained in a move that would mean England leaving Moeen Ali out as they have during this mini-series.
With Chris Woakes similarly coming back from the IPL, Plunkett made sure he will not be one to make way following a strong tour of the Caribbean in March by trapping Andy Balbirnie lbw with an 89mph delivery and persuading both Murtagh and McCarthy to pick out Ball on the rope in his second spell.
Rashid followed his five-wicket showing in Bristol by ending Kevin O’Brien’s brief repeat of his Bangalore six-hitting on 18. Mark Wood, who along with Willey endured some early butchery from Stirling, snuffed out Portferfield’s vigil when he was bowled trying a flick down leg, before completing the win by crashing a yorker into Dockrell’s stumps.
They are blaming Simon Mayo for 'normalising' drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus
Yes, obviously the DJs mentioned booze loads and repeatedly implied that it was fine and nice. As Northumbria’s associate professor of public health and wellbeing put it: “Alcohol consumption is often portrayed as the norm without negative consequences, and just 5% of references on all stations were about sensible drinking.” That’s a lot more discussion of sensible drinking than I would’ve expected.
This is a bit of a soft target, you might think. Leave the guys at Northumbria University alone. If they can get funding for counting the number of times Steve Wright mentions Lambrusco, maybe I should wish them luck. But I don’t. Because it’s another case of people scrutinising how other people talk and vetting them for inadvertent divergences from an approved value system. A mild case, perhaps – these guys aren’t no-platforming Peter Tatchell – but they are blaming Simon Mayo for “normalising” drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus. The study will probably be ignored but, in these inane times, you just can’t be completely sure.
So it might be worth saying something obvious: DJs on the radio have to talk like human beings – the specific human beings they happen to be. That’s the premise of this form of entertainment: natural chat interspersed with music. It’s not high culture but it passes the time in heavy traffic.
But it won’t work if the people at the microphone, desperately trying to keep the energy up, also have to reflect some externally imposed consensus of how life should be lived. That’s Thought for the Day, which is scripted in advance and lasts under three minutes. Any longer than that and it really would drive listeners to drink…
The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.
“I don’t read the newspapers. I don’t have a television at home. I barely knew who Donald Trump was,” Li said during an interview at his agent’s 14-floor studio in a high-rise called Golden Triangle.
Li’s career as a Trump impersonator is still in its infancy; following his debut in Shenzhen he travelled to the nearby city of Zhongshan to perform at the opening of a lighting store and recorded a commercial for a tea company in his home province of Hunan.
Like Trump, Li is a master of bluster and bravado although his is delivered in a thick Hunanese accent. “[I’m] no ordinary person now. I’m a great man... I’m an internet celebrity now!” he boasts.
Ren Shihe, a impressionist from Xi’an who has spent three decades playing everyone from Leonid Brezhnev to Saddam Hussein, said he charged up to 30,000 yuan (£3,400) per appearance.
Zou Danrong, Li’s BMW-driving agent, admitted his Chinese Trump was still a work in progress. In a bid to make his black-haired apprentice more convincing he was trying to teach him to be more effeminate, like the real-life Trump, and planned to buy him some blue contact lenses.
 A well-known talent agent, Zou already represents a range of world leaders including a Kim Jong-un from Hebei province; a Barack Obama from Guangdong and a Vladimir Putin from Anhui.
“In the US people are free to protest and to hold Trump’s photograph upside down. In China no one would dare to do this,” he added. “That’s politics.”

And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (£78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn’t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (£356m).
One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: “Why did you do it?” At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: “I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.”
Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.
He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors’s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.
Why did I do it? I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer
Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?
“There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,” he says.
Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors’s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year’s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (£10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel “sick”.
“I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,” he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.
But it didn’t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. “I didn’t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,” he says. “It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You’re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don’t get to go outside and say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’”
Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn’t really see anyone who wasn’t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn’t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.
And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company’s liking. He did as he was told.
“Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?” he writes. “Should any such line be drawn at all?” I’m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?
“I think it’s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that’s what I wish I had done much earlier,” he says. “But it’s very easy for me to say: ‘Follow your own morals and it will be fine.’ But it won’t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you’ll begin to run into trouble.” He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it’s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.
I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. “I don’t want to say,” he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned “a seven-figure sum”. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.
“You get these bonus cheques, but there’s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I’ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.” At £1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.
But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn’t perform well, and he felt short-changed.
I didn’t think about the system as a whole. You never say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’
“Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It’s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn’t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It’s more like you’ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.”
Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.
I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says – he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. “The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.”
But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He’s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? “I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,” he says, “but I don’t think so.” He says he couldn’t do it without becoming obsessed again.
Does he miss the money? “Of course, it’s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn’t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.”
A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: “Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn’t spend much time thinking about it – at least not until it was too late.”
“That was the only thing that I really liked,” he says now. “Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.”
I think he should stick to lecturing.
Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time – but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.
During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo Häyhä. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when Häyhä was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: “I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.” Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed “snipers”. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees – no matter what their job description is.
I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.
I wouldn’t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I would become
“Don’t worry,” I was told. “We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.” I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee’s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.
Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.
The euro rose to a six-month high in the wake of Emmanuel Macron’s convincing victory in the French election but the upside for the single currency could be short-lived, analysts warned.
In Asian trading on Monday, the euro rose as high as $1.1024 , its highest since 9 November, and also jumped to a one-year high of 124.58 yen against its Japanese counterpart.
“The market already priced in the victory of Macron,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “We saw some additional rise of the euro this morning, but considering the difficulty for Macron’s party to get a majority in the national assembly election, he may not bring higher growth.”
Looking at positioning in the euro, he said, “the market has squared its short positions, but there are no fresh reasons to take long positions, as there will likely be no new positive developments, and limited scope for upside for the euro”.
The muted analysis was partly based on an acknowledgment of the problems facing Macron, a 39-year-old former banker who has never held elected office.
Analysts at BlackRock in a note on Monday: “We expect the focus to shift to French legislative elections in June. These will be crucial for determining Macron’s ability to implement his economic program, which includes labour market reforms that would make it easier for French businesses to hire and fire.”
On the equities market, the mood was upbeat with Japan’s Nikkei bouncing more than 2% to its highest point since November 2015 after resuming following the long spring holiday.

The go-ahead for the nation state bill by the ministerial committee for legislation means it will now move forward to a vote by the country’s parliament. The bill has to pass several stages in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for it to become law and could also be challenged in the courts.
Critics say the law is discriminatory and could undermine Israel’s balance of being both a Jewish and democratic state by harming the rights of minorities.
Hebrew and Arabic are both Israel’s national languages, but the bill states that Hebrew would be the lone national language, downgrading Arabic to “a special status in the state” whose “speakers have the right to language-accessible state services”.
The legislation is designed to be enshrined in Israel’s basic law, regarded as the closest approximation in Israel to a constitution.
The timing of the bill – after four years of deliberations – is significant, coming two weeks before a planned visit by Donald Trump in which the US president had hoped to breath life into a moribund peace process.
Although the bill has undergone some changes in the drafting process – not least removing language that would have seen Israel’s democracy subordinated in importance to its Jewish identity – it remains highly contentious.
While the way Israel’s legislative process functions has long allowed parties and individuals to put forward legislation likely to be challenged by the courts, the latest proposed law comes in the context of Israel’s most rightwing ever government.
Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, representing Arab-Israeli parties, said the bill was a “declaration of war” on Israel’s Arab citizens. “Discrimination has received a legal stamp. The danger in this law in that it establishes two classes of citizen – Jewish and Arab,” he said.
Erel Margalit, a contender for the leadership of the centrist Zionist Union party, called the bill “reminiscent of dark periods” in history.
Zehava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, said the bill’s intention was to downgrade the rights of non-Jews in Israel. “The result of the Jewish state bill is clear. Jews will get preference over all other citizens, clearly violating human rights, democracy and the rights of the Arab minority in Israel,” she said.
The bill’s sponsor, Avi Dichter, an MP from Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, defended the proposals, as did other ministers.
 ”This is a small step for the Jewish state bill, which establishes that Israel is and will be a Jewish and democratic state, and it’s a big step towards defining our identity, not only in the eyes of the world but primarily for ourselves, Israelis – to be a free people in our land,” said Dichter after the committee’s vote.
He said the bill was necessary because “events of recent months prove that this is a battle for Israel’s image and national identity. The Palestinians no longer hide their goal of erasing the Jewish people’s nation state”.
The legislative committee’s chairman, Yariv Levin, also a Likud MP, said he had decided to put an end to foot-dragging over the bill. “We’ve been waiting to discuss and make a decision on this legislation for too long. This is a basic law, which has the simple objective of safeguarding Israel’s status as the nation state of the Jewish people. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been made into law so far,” he said.
Bzzz. Bzzz. I can still remember the sound and the feeling of having my head shaved for the first time. It was a warm evening in July, I had some kind of throat infection and we were about to go on holiday. I had been dyeing my hair various colours of the rainbow since I was 12. The only options I had left were green or … shaved. I was about to start a new job and felt, for a few reasons, that I was starting again. Shaved it would be. As my hair dropped to the floor, and we went shorter and shorter with the clippers, I felt lighter, liberated, ecstatic. It sounds ridiculous, but the effect was so powerful that my tonsils, or whatever it was, stopped hurting.
I had recently stopped drinking and I wanted to cut off the past and its boozy repetitions, to shed a side of me that was dangerous and destructive. I wanted to raze myself to ground zero and build myself back up again. Shaving my head felt like the most elemental and easy way to do it. Perhaps it was also a reaction against a conception of life as a sober person. It felt like an emboldening, a taking control of my identity, something anarchic and subversive in the face of a lifetime of Diet Coke, tea and early-to-bed. It also felt a bit brave, as if by doing it I could front away the fear of life without my crutch. In those early months, I felt raw, as if my skin had been removed, and having a shaved head somehow made me feel stronger.
When you find yourself drunk all the time, or hungover, your self-esteem can take a kicking. It took time to build mine back, but having a shaved head gave me a starting point. It also affirmed in me the simple concept of growth as intrinsic to life (well, for a while), that things change and move forward. Hair grows. Patterns can be broken. Neurons adapt.
The reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Friends seemed to like it, but elderly relatives? Not so much. My mother cried the first time she saw it, because she thought I looked ill. A friend’s mother told me it looked awful and scary. My grandmother was upset because it reminded her of images of people in Nazi concentration camps. I was a lot more comfortable at a festival or in a city rather than the rural corners of Scotland or the news desk of the newspaper where I was working at the time.
It is true that, historically, a shaved head is associated with some pretty bad stuff. Deposed emperors in Byzantium would have their heads shaved, along with castration and disfigurement. The Merovingians shaved the heads of dethroned kings or failed successors. French women who slept with German soldiers in the second world war had their heads shaved and were then paraded through the streets. It has been used as a tool to shame, dehumanise and mark in different cultures. It’s not all bad, though: Grace Jones said that shaving her head led directly to her first orgasm.
I kept my head shaved for a couple of years, enjoying the ease of my husband getting his clippers out, not costing a penny, wash and go. I loved the way my scalp felt like a velvety vole. But in a way, it was high maintenance. It required makeup and a proper outfit. And growing it out was a bore.
This month sees the 20th anniversary of the granting by New Labour of independence to the Bank of England.
It was not full-scale independence but “operational independence” in monetary policy: that is, the freedom to change interest rates without having to consult the chancellor. The Bank is still the Treasury’s agent in other matters, such as decisions about the nation’s currency reserves.
The Strand Group at King’s College London held a high-powered conference to mark Bank independence last week: but against the background of elections and all this Brexit nonsense, the anniversary of what was a controversial event at the time seems to have passed non-aficionados by.
I myself was against the move at the time, and while hardly anyone questions the idea now, I am still inclined to take the Zhou Enlai view. This is a reference to then Chinese premier’s reply in the 1970s when he was asked what he thought the consequences of the French Revolution had been. He famously replied: “Too early to tell.” This has gone down in fake history as a witty reference to the events of 1789, but an official who was present said Zhou was actually referring to the riots in Paris in 1968.
Even critics of Gordon Brown give him, and his economic adviser at the time, Ed Balls, credit for making the Bank independent in this area.
It is noteworthy, however, that most of the Brexiters who go on about parliamentary sovereignty seem to have no qualms about placing decisions in the hands of unelected officials.
The granting of independence was the final resort of British policymakers in the long, and losing, battle for Labour and Tories alike to control inflation. Both parties had problems with incomes policies in the 1970s. The Tories brought monetarism from 1979, but that failed – indeed, the doctrine was even subsequently disowned by Milton Friedman, its most prominent advocate. Then came Chancellor Lawson’s obsession with the success of the Germans in controlling inflation; his instrument was to be membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. When Margaret Thatcher vetoed that, Lawson directed the Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market so that the pound “shadowed” the Deutschmark.
When he was rumbled, there was hell to pay, ending with Lawson’s dramatic resignation in 1989. Ironically, after Lawson went, Thatcher was finally worn down a year later, and the pound joined the ERM in 1990.
Membership of the ERM then ended in sterling’s ignominious exit from the mechanism on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. Amazingly, the British establishment did not seem to be aware of what the Germans knew only too well: namely that the historic reunification of Germany at around the time we joined the ERM would have serious inflationary consequences, because of the massive cost of absorbing the run-down East German economy. It was exactly the wrong time to subject Britain to what was effectively German monetary policy.
John Major was prime minister, and he took the rap. Now, although some fanatics had been trying to reverse the result of the 1975 referendum (a two-to-one verdict in favour of remaining in the EEC we had joined in 1973) from the start, we can really date the onset of the cancerous growth of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party to the early 1990s. The general election of 1992 saw the end of the dominance of pro-Europeans in the parliamentary party and the rise of what the beleaguered Major termed the Eurosceptic “bastards”.
Meanwhile, after the ERM, the next supposed panacea for British inflation was central bank independence. While this period has coincided with low inflation, it has not necessarily caused it. Most industrial countries have had low inflation in recent times.
However, central bank independence is but a sideshow when it comes to the major economic crisis of our times, which is the prospect of Brexit.
Well, it is an open question whether the poison has been neutralised. Quite apart from that, we are in the lamentable position where a Tory party that used to have the national interest at heart is now sacrificing everything to its own preservation. Yes: thanks to Theresa May’s lame acceptance of the result of a referendum conducted on a false prospectus, the poison has now spread to the nation at large.
We have a government that really is, in Angela Merkel’s word, “delusional” about squaring the circle: obsessed by the immigration she failed to control at the Home Office, May wishes to leave the customs union and the single market while cherrypicking her way back into the best bits. This is impossible. As often happens, the people running this country do not seem to realise that our continental partners have their own interests, and tend to say what they mean.
It is not too late to rethink. My old friend Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, says that it is not irrevocable. It is reversible. There is still an opportunity for our leaders to see sense, and own up to the people.
I know the people have spoken. They spoke in 1945 and said one thing, and in 1951 and said another. Throughout the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, they said one thing, and then another. To coin a phrase: it is a people’s privilege to change its mind.
For the adventurous, and those willing to tolerate some unpredictable weather, the rewards are plenty.
The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Hak Song had worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before he was held on Saturday.
“A relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes,” the KCNA said.
Kim Sang Duk was arrested at the Pyongyang International Airport on 22 April, the KCNA said. It said he was “intercepted for committing criminal acts” to overthrow the North’s government, but didn’t elaborate.
On Sunday, the KCNA did not say whether the two cases were connected.
In Washington, the state department said it was aware of the report of the new detention and that “the security of US citizens is one of the department’s highest priorities”.
Kim Hak Song and Kim Sang Duk are among at least four Americans being detained in North Korea, as tensions between the two countries continue.
The others are Otto Warmbier, who is serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor for alleged anti-state acts, and Kim Dong Chul, serving a 10-year term with hard labor for alleged espionage.
Washington, Seoul and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, which in recent years have involved high-profile American missions sent to secure releases.
When an American citizen is reported detained, the US works with the Swedish embassy in the North Korean capital, since the US and the North do not have diplomatic relations.
The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is the only privately funded university in North Korea and is unique for having a large number of foreign staff.
Britain has more billionaires than ever in what equality campaigners said was a clear sign the UK economy is only working for the few at the top.
“While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain’s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the rich list.
Today, the Hinduja Group employs more than 70,000 people and has global investments in a range of sectors including oil and gas, property, media and banking. Current projects include the transformation of the Old War Office in Westminster into a luxury hotel.
The Equality Trust said the £83bn increase in wealth among the richest 1,000 people over the past year could pay the energy bills of all UK households for two and a half years and would be enough for the grocery bills for all food bank users for 56 years.
Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust, said that an elite was sitting on mountains of wealth in the fifth largest economy of the world. “The super-rich continue to streak away from the rest of us, while the poorest see their wealth shrink. This is an economy working for the few, not the many,” she said.
“Record numbers of people visited food banks last year, millions are locked out of a decent home and two-thirds of children in poverty are in working households.
“We know that inequality damages our economy and society, and makes it harder for ordinary people and their children to get on. With the general election fast approaching, our politicians need to decide the sort of country they want to build. One where we can all prosper or one where we’re picking crumbs from the super-rich’s table.”
At least 28 of the top 100 individuals or families in the rich list have donated to the Conservative party or individual Tory politicians, according to the Electoral Commission’s records. Among them are David and Simon Reuben, third on the list, who donated to Boris Johnson.
Others in the top 10 who donated to the party include Guy, George and Galen Weston and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, who donated to the West Suffolk Conservatives.
The combined wealth of all the Conservative donors on the list is £102bn, according to the analysis by Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. “The fact that nearly a third of UK’s 100 richest people have given money to the Tories tells you all you need to know about where Theresa May’s priorities lie,” Watson said. “She claims to speak for working people but she’s beholden to the billionaires that bankroll her party.”
Watts said there was more diversity in this years’ rich list. “More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with private equity barons and hedge fund managers.”
The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”
“I know nobody wants to hear it but I am brave enough to say it. The pitch was really dry today. We gave it all the water we had but after 15 minutes it was really dry again with the wind. It was difficult. You could see it … a lot passes you thought ‘why are they playing this?’ But it was difficult. In a possession game you need to have the best circumstances, if possible, in a home game especially, but today we couldn’t have this. That is nobody’s fault; it is only a description.
“It is not nice to drop points at home but now we play away and then we have another home game. We really still enjoy playing at home. It is only a mental issue if you think it is one. We don’t see this. The boys like it here, they like playing in front of their crowd. That is all. Today the atmosphere was really good. People were really in the game. Everybody tried everything and it didn’t work out finally.”
“It’s very frustrating,” Milner said. “Obviously the penalty is my fault and the fact we didn’t get three points is definitely my fault. I have to live with that. Fraser is a top keeper. You have to take those chances. I’ve been around long enough to make sure that doesn’t worry me. I can’t do any more than hold my hands up. Southampton are a tough team to break down.
“We didn’t play as well as we would have liked. The penalty was a big chance and we didn’t take it. We have to win our remaining two games [to be sure now of a top-four finish].”
Jorge Luis Borges' poetry is usually considered profound and thought-provoking. But an upcoming Chinese TV series will make an effort to bring out the Argentine poet's romantic works.
The poem, written in 1934, is used by his character, a lonely entrepreneur, to win the heart of his true love.
The series will be aired on Beijing Satellite TV and the streaming site PPTV on May 11.
The cast includes mainland actress Pan Zhilin and Taiwan actresses Cherrie Ying and Elaine Jin.

The cost of living in Asian cities generally increased last year, with Singapore remaining at the top for the fourth consecutive year. But exchange rate volatility and resurgent commodity prices, rather than productivity gains, were responsible for the increase.
Asia remains the most diverse region in terms of the cost of living. Ironically, with several major agricultural and manufacturing product exporters, East Asian cities tend to be the world's priciest places for tradable products, such as general grocery and clothing.
Asian cities continue to climb up the world cost of living ladder, accounting for half of the 10 most expensive cities in the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Exchange rate volatility was the major factor that determined the cost of living in cities. With the strength of the US dollar moderating and the euro remaining relatively stable, currencies such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar have gained in value, ending up with higher relative cost. Underpinned by a stronger yen, Tokyo and Osaka have returned to the 10 most expensive cities' list, by climbing up seven and nine places. And Seoul, supported by currency and income growth, has moved up two places to the 6th spot.
The steady depreciation of the yuan and weaker consumer sentiment have dragged down living costs in China. Five Chinese mainland cities－Beijing, Suzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Dalian－are among the biggest movers down the ranking ladder in the past year. Shanghai remains the most expensive city in the Chinese mainland, though its relative costs are lower. The city is 8 percent cheaper than New York City now compared with just 3 percent 12 months ago. The city used to be as expensive as Tokyo, but is now cheaper than not only Tokyo and Osaka but also Sydney and Melbourne.
Asian cities' rankings are characterized by extremes, the most expensive and the cheapest. Singapore and Hong Kong continue to be the most and second-most expensive cities, while cities such as Colombo, Kathmandu, New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karachi and Bangalore represent the best value for money in Asia and are among the 30 cheapest in the world because of lower incomes and closer links to domestic agriculture and manufacturing supply chains.
A closer look at the most expensive cities shows Asian cities tend to form the priciest locations for tradable goods, such as grocery and daily necessities. Yet they offer non-tradable goods at much lower prices than European cities. This perhaps reflects a greater premium on discretionary spending for better quality products, such as organic food, branded clothes and advanced electronic products, in high-income cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo. The grocery products many Asian countries, such as China and Malaysia, export often do not match the demand for wealthier Asian countries' premium consumption.
Government subsidy is another important factor that decides Asian cities' ranks. Grocery prices in cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea, for instance, are among the highest in the world.
In Seoul, topping up a grocery basket is almost 50 percent more expensive than in New York City. The average price of a 1-kilogram loaf of bread in Seoul is 140 percent more than in New Delhi, and much higher than in China, Malaysia, New Zealand, which export agricultural products. Due to limited domestic arable land, the ROK relies on imports of agricultural products, but with high tariffs to protect its domestic agricultural industry, it ends up with very high grocery prices. In India, one sees the opposite trend. To reduce hunger, India provides subsidies for staple foods and other agricultural products, lowering the cost of foods.
In the long run, this divergence is likely to persist and Asian cities are expected to become relatively more expensive as emerging economies continue to supply much of the world's wage and demand growth. But the capacity for economic shocks and currency swings could make the ride quite bumpy.

A basketball-sharing locker is seen in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province. [Photo/Weibo]




The company has introduced several pilot lockers with basketballs at the city's public and campus courts. Users can borrow and return a basketball through the company's WeChat account after paying a 29-yuan ($4.2) deposit. One basketball costs 1.5 yuan for half an hour.
The lockers are equipped with a camera to ensure the process is completed properly. According to the company, the lockers can also hold personal items for users.
A photo of the lockers was posted online by a Weibo user, China's version of Twitter, which intrigued many netizens.
"It's indeed troublesome to bring a basketball oneself. With the service, you can rent a ball near the court when you want to play and return it afterwards and don't need to be burdened by anything if you want to go somewhere else," Weibo user xiaohaierhaipi wrote.
A company staff member said the pilot project is going well in Jiaxing and the service will soon be expanded to other cities nationwide.
A LAWYER IN GUANGZHOU, South China's Guangdong province, is suing a local expressway company after he was charged 10 yuan ($1.4) for using a highway designed to link non-adjacent towns to an expressway, which he claims he did not use. Legal Daily commented on Saturday:
The linking lanes usually have a tollgate on one end and a non-adjacent town on the other. In some cases, drivers who reach the tollgate from other lanes rather than tolled highway are still charged the extra fee. The Guangzhou lawyer is not alone in questioning whether a driver should pay for the highway linking to an expressway if he or she does not use it.
Expressway companies argue that they have the right to charge such a fee to cover the construction and maintenance costs of these lanes. While many drivers refuse to buy such an explanation because they believe that the pre-express lanes are not expressways and hence any such charges, which can be more expensive than toll fees, are illegitimate.
Of all the controversies surrounding the case, one thing is clear: Drivers should not be charged for a service they do not use. What the Guangzhou expressway company has done does not hold any legal water, despite the fact that it assumes that any driver arriving at the tollgate has used the highway providing access to the expressway.
It is unlikely that the local transportation authorities permit drivers to be charged a fee when they do not use roads that link to expressways, and even if they do, such a decision is still subject to relevant laws such as the Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests and the regulations on toll roads. If the toll authorization is misinterpreted, whether on purpose or not, the expressway company should at least explain why it did so and on what grounds it justifies charging all drivers indiscriminately.
The rapid expansion of expressway network in China is praiseworthy, but it also has caused problems. In addition to charging fees fairly and legally, local transportation officials should launch a thorough review of their road management to protect the legitimate interests of drivers.
Over 500 artists from 22 countries will attend the annual cultural event this year. It runs through May 31.
The play will be staged at Tsinghua University on May 20 and 21.
Directed by Kirill Glushajev and performed by the actors and actresses of the State Small Theatre of Vilnius, the play tells the story of Vassa Zheleznova, a woman whose alcoholic husband assaults her and does not do enough for their son while alive. She works in a factory for years and raises her son but eventually she and her son clash.
"The conflicts between materialism and spirituality, and between sociability and individualism have been presented well in The Mother. We may see it as a Lithuanian story but at the same time it's recognizable in every society," says Glushajev.
"I am more interested in the conflict between humans as individuals, especially in a family, rather than between different societies or ideologies," the 33-year-old director adds.
Lithuanian actress Egle Gabrenaite, who leads the cast as the mother in the play, has done more than 60 stage roles.
WeChat Pay advertisements hang from the ceiling at a supermarket in East China's Hangzhou city. LONG WEI/CHINA DAILY
WeChat is already one of China's most popular mobile payment methods. Now the social media app, owned by Internet giant Tencent, is teaming up with Silicon mobile payment startup Citcon to take its services to the US market.
Through WeChat accounts, users will be able to pay for whatever they need in Chinese currency renminbi without cash, just as they do in China.
For four consecutive years, China has been the world number one outbound tourism country, accounting for over 13 percent of the total tourism revenue globally. The United States has been one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travelers.
"Last year, over 100 million Chinese people traveled outside of China. Once they see this place can accept WeChat Pay, they can use their mobile phones. They certainly receive much warmer welcomes‍ from foreign countries," according to Chuck Huang, CEO of Citcon.
Mobile payment is the new frontier of commerce, and China is leading this trend. By providing an easy-to-use mobile payment and cross-border marketing solution, WeChat is empowering global merchants to connect with millions of Chinese consumers.
Currently, WeChat Pay is available in 15 countries and regions, for payments in 12 foreign currencies.
Tencent has now joined Apple and Google-parent Alphabet in the ranks of the world's biggest firms by market capitalization, with a value of more than 302 billion US dollars. Shares in the tech company hit a record high on Tuesday.
It's the only firm outside the US among the world's top 10 most valuable companies.‍

President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Emmanuel Macron on Monday for winning the French presidential election.
Mentioning that France was the first western power to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Xi said that China-France relations have strategic significance and international influence, which have seen healthy and stable development in previous years.
In the message, Xi pointed out that as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and powers with great global influence, China and France have important duties in world peace and development.
The continuous development of China-France relations would not only benefit the people of both countries, but also contribute to global peace, stability and prosperity, he said.
China is willing to make joint efforts with France to enhance the development of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level.

Centrist Macron wins French presidential election
Emmanuel Macron will be the next president of France after decisively defeating Marine Le Pen in Sunday's second-round run-off, according to early polling issued after voting closed at 8 pm local time.
Le Pen phoned Macron to congratulate him, and he was also called by Theresa May, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and received a message from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The centrist Macron is predicted to win 65.5 percent of the vote to right-winger Le Pen's 34.45 percent. The result shows that Macron did better than previous opinion polls suggested and that Le Pen's support deteriorated during the last two weeks.
Traditional Chinese medicine originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners use herbal medicines and various mind and body practices, such as acupuncture and Tai chi, to treat or prevent health problems.[Photo/Xinhua]
"It can hurt a little, but the pain does not stay, it takes maybe a few seconds then it goes away," Donnersmarck told Xinhua on Friday at an acupuncture clinic.
As a recognized authority on Traditional Chinese medicine with a degree in Western medicine, Dr. Wu has been practicing in Santa Monica for 27 years.
Donnersmarck admitted that it was scary when he saw the acupuncture needles for the first time. "Acupuncture is a very precise, careful and caring process... the doctor can not miss by a few millimeters," he told Xinhua, "With Dr. Wu, you feel so much the deep wisdom, the experience, the knowledge. I feel it so much and I trust him."
His trust paid him back. Without any surgery, Donnersmarck's problem was solved in one month. "I found that Western medicine can be very aggressive, and it has extreme side effects," Donnersmarck said. "But for Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, they do not have side effects, it is about activating the energy and oxygen flow in the body, it is about helping the body heal itself."
Another thing that Donnersmarck found impressive was how Dr. Wu takes Western medicine into consideration and uses that in Traditional Chinese medicine.

Even though the Republic of Korea's presidential election is just one day away, the candidates are still debating security matters rather than economic recovery and employment, because the winner will have the tough job of dealing with the security jigsaw on the Korean Peninsula.




The US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, according to claims, is operational to a large extent. And the likelihood of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducting its sixth nuclear test remains high as the United States threatens to relinquish "strategic patience".
Seoul needs deft diplomatic maneuverings, not some "defensive" weapons, to safeguard national security. The ROK's economic prospects don't look good either. The reform proposed by impeached and ousted president Park Geun-hye did little to break the plutocracy, which is still thwarting economic growth. In other words, the paradox that a government requires enough votes as well as financial support to run a country might keep haunting the new ROK administration.
The ROK presidential election is being held not only prematurely but also amid fears that a regional conflict could break out at any moment. That THAAD may be combat ready very soon will leave the new ROK president little room to take immediate strategic decisions. In fact, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party, the frontrunner in the presidential race had stressed that the final decision on THAAD should be left to the next government.
The Park administration's decision that THAAD can better counter the threat from Pyongyang (and the interim administration's ratification of the move) will make it difficult for the new ROK president to take a different course on national security.
Instead of testing its ballistic missiles, Pyongyang held its "largest ever live artillery drill" on April 25 to mark the 85th anniversary of the founding of its army. That said, Seoul will be simplifying the complex security and diplomatic issues if it places its faith in THAAD and its military alliance with Washington for safeguarding its national security.
The paramount security risk facing the ROK is the DPRK's nuclear program, whose longevity has a lot to do with the mixed defense structure in Northeast Asia. Rather than working closely with China, an important party to the global denuclearization efforts, the ROK chose to depend on its military alliance with the US and Japan for its national security.
US President Donald Trump has said that he wants a diplomatic resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue despite warning of a "major, major" conflict with the DPRK. In this context, the ROK could help resolve the disputes surrounding the DPRK nuclear issue.
Peaceful handling of the nuclear issue is at the core of the interests of both Seoul and Beijing, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry has reiterated China's strong opposition to the DPRK's nuclear and missile tests.
The new ROK president may have an unenviable job on hand, with the country's security and diplomatic situation approaching a turning point. There is hope, though, because strategic patience and delicate maneuverings have not yet exhausted. In this regard, concerted efforts to resume the Kaesong Industrial Complex in the DPRK's border town, restart the tours to the DPRK's Mount Kumgang resort, and recalibrate China-ROK relations would be more than worth the trouble.

LONDON — Arsene Wenger got the better of managerial rival Jose Mourinho for the first time in a competitive game as Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday to keep alive its Champions League qualification hopes.
Granit Xhaka, with a deflected shot, and former United player Danny Welbeck, with a bullet header, scored goals in a four-minute span early in the second half to end United's 25-match unbeaten in the league dating to October.
This was the 16th competitive head to head between Wenger and Mourinho — and the 13th in league play — since 2004. It has been a one-sided rivalry but Wenger finally got a victory over the man who once dubbed him a "specialist in failure," for a result that might end United's chances of a top-four finish and leaves Arsenal with some hope.
"Finally, I leave this (Emirates) stadium with Arsenal fans happy," Mourinho said. "It's the first time I see them smile, enjoy."Arsenal moved two points behind fifth-place United with a game in hand, and is seven points behind third-placed Liverpool having played two games fewer and six behind fourth-placed Manchester City having played one game fewer. Wenger's team has four matches remaining to earn a 20th straight season in the Champions League.
"We still have a mathematical chance but we need some help," Wenger said. "But the best help we can get is by winning our own games."A disappointing game burst into life in the 54th when Xhaka, afforded plenty of space in central midfield following a throw-in, advanced and sent in a 30-meter (yard) shot that struck the turned back of Ander Herrera and looped over goalkeeper David de Gea.
Welbeck, who was sold to Arsenal in 2014 to end a 13-year association with United, has now scored in each of his last three appearances against his old club after powering a header in off the bar in the 57th from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross.
Mourinho made eight changes to his starting team from the 1-0 win over Celta Vigo in the first leg of the Europa League semifinals on Thursday. The second leg is at Old Trafford on Thursday and Mourinho has suggested the European competition, which offers a place in the Champions League for the winner, is his priority for the remainder of the season.
"Of course, we knew we were not coming in our maximum power," Mourinho said. "Thursday is the match of the season."It meant the 19-year-old Axel Tuanzebe was handed his Premier League debut, at right back up against Alexis Sanchez, and he performed excellently. Scott McTominay, a 20-year-old midfielder, came on as a second-half substitute for his first-team debut while Paul Pogba — the world's most expensive player — didn't even come off the bench.
United hasn't scored away to a top-six rival all season.
Arsenal will climb above United with a win at Southampton on Wednesday.

A Chinese company is not only pumping 'black gold' and providing jobs, but also establishing community projects for locals, reports Ren Qi in Aktobe, Kazakhstan
Editor's note: This is the ninth in a series of reports focusing on the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's proposed trading route linking Asia, Europe and Africa.
Kazakhstan holds a special place in the history of Belt and Road Initiative, because President Xi Jinping proposed the ambitious initiative during a speech at Nazarbayev University in Astana, the Kazakh capital, in 2013.
China has been working closely with Kazakhstan for about 20 years, mainly in the energy sector. That cooperation has expanded since the launch of the landmark project, which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
Aktobe, in the west, is Kazakhstan's second-largest region but it has the lowest population density in the country, with just 2.6 people per square kilometer.
It's also the location of a prime example of the strong links between the two nations: China National Petroleum Corp AktobeMunaiGas, known as CNPC AMG, Kazakhstan's fifth-largest oil and gas producer.
In June 1997, China National Petroleum Corp, the nation's largest oil and gas producer and supplier, bought a 60.34 percent stake in the Kazakh company and obtained production licenses for three oil fields and a contract for an oil exploration block.
"The acquisition was the company's first investment in Central Asia, and the development of the Aktobe project is a prime example of China's oil and gas cooperation in Kazakhstan," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan Corp, a subsidiary established to oversee operations.
Later, CNPC was awarded four more oil and gas projects in the country, along with two exploration projects and the Kazakhstan-China crude oil pipeline, the Northwest oil pipeline, and phase two of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline.
Construction of the 1,454-kilometer-long western section of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline was completed on April 14. According to the company, the pipeline can now carry more than 5 billion cubic meters a year from Kazakhstan to Chna.
"China is busy building the Silk Road Economic Belt throughout Central Asia, and we see these oil and natural gas pipelines as an 'energy Silk Road'," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan.
CNPC now holds 89.17 percent of CNPC AMG, which produced more than 134 million metric tons of crude oil and 72.3 billion cu m of natural gas between 1997 and the end of last year, according to company data.
Wang Junren, general manager of CNPC AMG, said the project has faced several challenges since it was established, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the drop in the price of oil between 2010 and 2015.
"However, thanks to a better energy cooperation environment, such as a higher oil price and positive policies introduced as part of the initiative, the development of CNPC AMG has jumped in the past two years," he said.
"The initiative is an updated version of China's international cooperation model, and the Silk Road Economic Belt is helping to raise the level of sustainable cooperation between China and Kazakhstan," he added.
Wang Yanfeng, deputy chief engineer and head of field operations in Aktobe, said the company's employees have made many sacrifices to ensure the project's success.
After working at the company's oil field in Daqing, Heilongjiang province, for seven years, Wang studied in Moscow from 2001 to 2003 to further his professional skills. After that, he moved to Kazakhstan.
"When I arrived in Aktobe, the company was in a critical situation because the price of oil had almost reached its lowest point and the business was really not smooth. Living and working conditions were also quite poor," he recalled.
The hardest thing was traveling the 270 km between the oil field and the regional capital, also called Aktobe: "The roads were bad, and there were deep potholes all the way to the field, so we had to ride in an open pickup truck for more than eight hours in winter."
Acts of charity
CNPC AMG has signed memorandums of understanding with the Aktobe regional government every year since 1997, and has donated more than $47 million to local charities.
The company has spent more than $694 million to boost local amenities, including subsidizing medical services and building infrastructure, such as hospitals and cultural or religious venues, according to Yury Shikarev, deputy director of the general manager's office.
In 2003, the company bought 80 apartments in downtown Aktobe city. It offered them to World War II veterans free of charge as part of celebrations to mark the 58th anniversary of the end of the war.
"We also spend $63,700 a year on newspaper subscriptions for the old soldiers," he said. "Furthermore, we sponsored a Veterans' Day to commemorate them, which received positive feedback from local people."
Xu Anping, deputy general manager of CNPC AMG, visits the apartments to meet with the veterans every year.
"For a company exploring natural resources in a foreign country, relations with local governments, and especially local communities, are very important," he said.
Xu was one of the first Chinese workers to arrive in Aktobe in 1997. He said the CNPC management team understood the need for positive relations and immediately set about cultivating them.
In the first year, CNPC AMG bought and renovated an old sanatorium. When the work had been completed, the company organized a three-month summer camp for the children of its Chinese and Kazakh employees.
"Now, our summer camp is one of the most famous in Aktobe, or even western Kazakhstan. It has become a fairytale land for the children of the region," Xu said, with pride.

China Post has recently released on its WeChat account a free set of 16 animated stickers, or biaoqing bao, each portraying a type of dinosaur found in China.
In each sticker, the cartoon dinosaur expresses various emotions, such as shock, joy and anger, or depicts a scene, such as saying goodbye.
Featured genera include the Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic, the remains of which were first found in Sichuan province in 1979, and Liaoningosaurus from the early Cretaceous period; two fossil specimens were collected in Liaoning province.
The stickers are to generate interest in a set of seven stamps, titled Dinosaurs of China, which China Post will issue on May 19.
Jorge Luis Borges' poetry is usually considered profound and thought-provoking. But an upcoming Chinese TV series will make an effort to bring out the Argentine poet's romantic works.
The poem, written in 1934, is used by his character, a lonely entrepreneur, to win the heart of his true love.
The series will be aired on Beijing Satellite TV and the streaming site PPTV on May 11.
The cast includes mainland actress Pan Zhilin and Taiwan actresses Cherrie Ying and Elaine Jin.

'Ode to Joy 2' to hit the small screen in May
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also called the Forbidden City, said on Friday that it will open its first permanent satellite gallery outside Beijing on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, Fujian province, on May 13.
The Kulangsu Gallery of Foreign Artifacts from the Palace Museum Collections will be in a former hospital that was set up by a Dutch-American missionary in 1898.
The opening exhibition features 219 artifacts including antique clocks, scientific instruments and paintings from abroad. They come from the 16th to the early 20th century.
The artifacts were chosen from the Palace Museum's collection of some 10,000 foreign artifacts, many of which were brought by missionaries and diplomats to the court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Because the museum has lacked a space to present the items, most of those going on display in Xiamen have long been stored in warehouses.
"The Palace Museum has the responsibility to find a place to show the artifacts to give the public a wider view of the world's civilization," said Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. "Due to historical reasons, in Western museums, we can see many items from abroad, but such institutions are quite rare in China."
Gulangyu Island, a top tourist spot once called Kulangsu, hosted the settlements of 13 countries from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, making the 1.88-square-kilometer island a cultural melting pot.
"The island is a center of historical architecture from many countries," Shan said. "Its atmosphere echoes our exhibits from overseas, and is thus a perfect place to display them."
Gulangyu's bid to become a World Heritage Site will be taken up at a UNESCO conference in Poland in July. Ni Chao, a standing member of the Xiamen committee of the Communist Party of China, said the new, 5,168-square-meter museum will be a bonus for the island's cultural landscape.
Belt and Road has support of 100-plus countries, international organizations
When a train approached a freight railway station in Warsaw, Poland, on June 20, President Xi Jinping, who was making a state visit to the country, happily bit into a red apple, as did his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda.
The two leaders were attending a ceremony to mark the arrival of the first China-Europe Block Train, carrying Chinese-made products, including electronic components, to Warsaw. When the train returned to China, it was laden with Polish commodities, including produce, such as apples.
Boosting the interconnection of Asia and the rest of the world－the purpose of the China-Europe Block Train－is one of the goals of the China-proposed Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, collectively known as the Belt and Road Initiative.
The initiative, put forward by Xi in 2013, has become one of the most important public goods China offers the world and a key vehicle for Beijing to help improve global governance.
China has invested more than $50 billion in the programs related to the initiative and has won the support of over 100 countries and international organizations－more than 40 have signed cooperation agreements with China.
At least 28 heads of state and government will attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on May 14 and 15 in Beijing. The forum will be the highest-profile international meeting on the Belt and Road since the initiative was put forward.
Xi will attend the opening ceremony and host a roundtable leaders summit. The meeting is expected to translate the ambitious blueprint into solid progress and turn a new page on the initiative.
According to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the results of the forum will range from consensus-building to specific measures on implementation. China expects to sign agreements with about 20 countries and 20 international organizations at the event.
Launched by China, shared by the world
During his visit to Kazakhstan in September 2013, Xi proposed building the Silk Road Economic Belt to boost regional cooperation. A month later, in a speech to the Indonesian parliament, he put forward a proposal to jointly establish the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
With its guiding principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, the initiative has been defined by Xi as "a chorus of all countries along the routes, not only for China itself".
During his overseas trips in the past years, Xi repeatedly called on the countries－including in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America－to cooperate with China on the initiative.
"Instead of seeking any sphere of influence, China calls on all countries to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road," he said in a speech in January 2016 at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.
The past three years have witnessed the launch, expansion, faster-than-expected progress and fruitful outcomes of the Belt and Road Initiative.
According to the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, Chinese businesses have invested more than $50 billion in countries along the Belt and Road and have helped to build 56 economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 of those countries, generating nearly $1.1 billion in tax revenue and 180,000 local jobs.
"Through the Belt and Road Initiative, I want to share China's development opportunities with the countries along the routes and achieve joint prosperity," Xi said in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the business leader's forum of the G20 in September.
The Belt and Road Initiative has been widely recognized in the international community, showing that it is in accord with the will of the people, Xi said while visiting a port in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region last month.
Wang Yiwei, a professor at Renmin University of China's School of International Relations, said that since the launch of the initiative, China has been sharing its expertise in fields such as infrastructure construction and clean energy with countries and regions along the routes.
Though proposed by China, the initiative is an open, inclusive proposal and welcomes participation from all sides, he said.
Injecting impetus intoglobal economy
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation meets an increasingly urgent need for a new cooperation platform that brings countries together to pull the world out of the economic mire and inject fresh energy into interconnected development.
Last year, the world experienced the worst economic hardship since the global financial crisis, with a 13-percent drop in foreign direct investment and weak trade growth.
Chinese companies' investment in countries along the Belt and Road routes have resulted in a number of major projects, which contributed to those countries' economic growth, Xi said in January in his keynote speech at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland.
A series of major transportation, energy and communication projects, including the multipurpose road-rail Padma Bridge in Bangladesh, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and China Railway Express trains to Europe, have advanced over the past three years along with the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.
In November 2014, Xi announced that China will contribute $40 billion to set up the Silk Road Fund to boost infrastructure and resource development while improving industrial and financial cooperation along the centuries-old Silk Road trading routes.
In 2015, China set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to provide financing for infrastructure improvement in Asia. The AIIB has 70 members, so far, and its total lending fund amounts to over $2 billion.
China is pushing forward six economic corridors in the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative: the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, the China-Mongolia-Russia corridor, the China-Central Asia-West Asia corridor, the China-Indochina Peninsula corridor, the China-Pakistan corridor and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar corridor.
The six corridors form together a trade and transport network across Eurasia, laying a solid foundation for regional and trans-regional development plans.
Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, said the international community has higher expectations for China now, at a time when the global economic recovery lacks power.
"The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will hopefully help drive away the clouds of the economic doldrums and channel more positivity to global economic growth," he said.

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.
 
The United States is Chinese tourists' top destination for road trips overseas. PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Chinese are increasingly preferring road trips overseas as the preferred way to travel and soak in sights and cultures. The United States remains their top destination with Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco being particularly popular.
The US is followed by New Zealand, Germany, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, in terms of popularity, according to a recent report Tuniu Corp, an online travel agency based in Nanjing.
Besides, the United Arab of Emirates, Belgium and France are growing in popularity as Chinese driving licenses are valid there.
The top five cities where self-driving outbound Chinese tourists come from are Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing. These cities have more than two million car owners, making them more likely to travel in their own vehicles in China and in rented cars abroad.
Currently, there are more than 360 million car drivers in China, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
"The growth of holidays marked by car drives is frequently associated with wealth, freedom, and choice, and a growing middle-class in China," said Alex Yan, COO of Tuniu Corp.
"Meanwhile, we found that Chinese road trippers prefer to stay at nicer hotels, but not motels near the roads. More than 80 percent of the them usually stay at four-star or five-star hotels."
The majority of tourists who prefer self-driving trips are aged between 21 and 40, with those aged between 31 and 40 dominating this group. Most of them are affluent and tend to pursue unique trip experiences. Besides, many of them have young children and road trips fulfil their demand for travel with kids.
Lily Min, 26, an office worker in Beijing, said she and her boyfriend last year traveled to Hawaii, where they rented a red convertible.
"Hawaii is large and it's inconvenient to travel around if you don't rent a car or travel with a group. It feels really cool to drive by ourselves, as we have greater control over our time. And it's not expensive to rent a car－it costs less than $100 per day," she said.
Overseas road trips tend to take longer than an average trip. About half of these trips last year lasted 11 to15 days.
Domestic road trips are also proving to be popular. Among the well-received weekend getaways are Zhuhai and Guangzhou in Guangdong province, and Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
Longer domestic road trips to Tibet, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are also popular among Chinese tourists. About half of the domestic road trips last six to 10 days.




Over 500 artists from 22 countries will attend the annual cultural event this year. It runs through May 31.
The play will be staged at Tsinghua University on May 20 and 21.
Directed by Kirill Glushajev and performed by the actors and actresses of the State Small Theatre of Vilnius, the play tells the story of Vassa Zheleznova, a woman whose alcoholic husband assaults her and does not do enough for their son while alive. She works in a factory for years and raises her son but eventually she and her son clash.
"The conflicts between materialism and spirituality, and between sociability and individualism have been presented well in The Mother. We may see it as a Lithuanian story but at the same time it's recognizable in every society," says Glushajev.
"I am more interested in the conflict between humans as individuals, especially in a family, rather than between different societies or ideologies," the 33-year-old director adds.
Lithuanian actress Egle Gabrenaite, who leads the cast as the mother in the play, has done more than 60 stage roles.
As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.
Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.
WeChat Pay advertisements hang from the ceiling at a supermarket in East China's Hangzhou city. LONG WEI/CHINA DAILY
WeChat is already one of China's most popular mobile payment methods. Now the social media app, owned by Internet giant Tencent, is teaming up with Silicon mobile payment startup Citcon to take its services to the US market.
Through WeChat accounts, users will be able to pay for whatever they need in Chinese currency renminbi without cash, just as they do in China.
For four consecutive years, China has been the world number one outbound tourism country, accounting for over 13 percent of the total tourism revenue globally. The United States has been one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travelers.
"Last year, over 100 million Chinese people traveled outside of China. Once they see this place can accept WeChat Pay, they can use their mobile phones. They certainly receive much warmer welcomes‍ from foreign countries," according to Chuck Huang, CEO of Citcon.
Mobile payment is the new frontier of commerce, and China is leading this trend. By providing an easy-to-use mobile payment and cross-border marketing solution, WeChat is empowering global merchants to connect with millions of Chinese consumers.
Currently, WeChat Pay is available in 15 countries and regions, for payments in 12 foreign currencies.
Tencent has now joined Apple and Google-parent Alphabet in the ranks of the world's biggest firms by market capitalization, with a value of more than 302 billion US dollars. Shares in the tech company hit a record high on Tuesday.
It's the only firm outside the US among the world's top 10 most valuable companies.‍

"The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will hopefully help drive away the clouds of the economic doldrums and channel more positivity to global economic growth," he said.

LONDON — Arsene Wenger got the better of managerial rival Jose Mourinho for the first time in a competitive game as Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday to keep alive its Champions League qualification hopes.
Granit Xhaka, with a deflected shot, and former United player Danny Welbeck, with a bullet header, scored goals in a four-minute span early in the second half to end United's 25-match unbeaten in the league dating to October.
This was the 16th competitive head to head between Wenger and Mourinho — and the 13th in league play — since 2004. It has been a one-sided rivalry but Wenger finally got a victory over the man who once dubbed him a "specialist in failure," for a result that might end United's chances of a top-four finish and leaves Arsenal with some hope.
"Finally, I leave this (Emirates) stadium with Arsenal fans happy," Mourinho said. "It's the first time I see them smile, enjoy."Arsenal moved two points behind fifth-place United with a game in hand, and is seven points behind third-placed Liverpool having played two games fewer and six behind fourth-placed Manchester City having played one game fewer. Wenger's team has four matches remaining to earn a 20th straight season in the Champions League.
"We still have a mathematical chance but we need some help," Wenger said. "But the best help we can get is by winning our own games."A disappointing game burst into life in the 54th when Xhaka, afforded plenty of space in central midfield following a throw-in, advanced and sent in a 30-meter (yard) shot that struck the turned back of Ander Herrera and looped over goalkeeper David de Gea.
Welbeck, who was sold to Arsenal in 2014 to end a 13-year association with United, has now scored in each of his last three appearances against his old club after powering a header in off the bar in the 57th from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross.
Mourinho made eight changes to his starting team from the 1-0 win over Celta Vigo in the first leg of the Europa League semifinals on Thursday. The second leg is at Old Trafford on Thursday and Mourinho has suggested the European competition, which offers a place in the Champions League for the winner, is his priority for the remainder of the season.
"Of course, we knew we were not coming in our maximum power," Mourinho said. "Thursday is the match of the season."It meant the 19-year-old Axel Tuanzebe was handed his Premier League debut, at right back up against Alexis Sanchez, and he performed excellently. Scott McTominay, a 20-year-old midfielder, came on as a second-half substitute for his first-team debut while Paul Pogba — the world's most expensive player — didn't even come off the bench.
United hasn't scored away to a top-six rival all season.
Arsenal will climb above United with a win at Southampton on Wednesday.

A Chinese lawyer on trial for subversion has denied claims he was tortured while in police detention.
Xie Yang, of Hunan province, is accused of subversion and "disrupting court order", a charge similar to contempt of court.
At a hearing at Changsha Intermediate People's Court on Monday morning, the 45-year-old said the police and prosecutors had adequately protected his legal rights.
He said the authorities did not use torture to force a confession, adding that he has "not suffered torture", according to footage of the trial released on Sina Weibo.
The court also posted a transcript of the hearing online.
Police placed Xie under investigation in July 2015 and arrested him on Jan 8 last year, according to prosecutors.
The trial was attended by more than 40 people, including Xie's relatives and attorneys, legislators and political advisers.
The hearing was also open to journalists from foreign and domestic media organizations.

BEIJING - China's foreign trade surplus widened in April as import growth decline outpaced that of exports, customs data showed Monday.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.3 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan ($179.8 billion), down from the 22.3-percent increase in March.
Imports expanded 18.6 percent to 979.1 billion yuan, compared with a 26.3-percent increase a month ago.
That leaves a trade surplus of 262.3 billion yuan, up 0.6 percent year on year. The surplus widened from 164.3 billion yuan seen in March.
In the first four months, total trade volume added up to 8.42 trillion yuan, up 20.3 percent year on year.
While the April trade growth fell short of expectations, customs data reflected improved trade structure.
In the first four months, general trade expanded 21.6 percent year on year to 4.75 trillion yuan, accounting for 56.5 percent of the total trade volume.
Trade of private enterprises grew 21.7 percent to 3.17 trillion yuan in the first four months, accounting for 37.6 percent of the total, and 0.4 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
Despite rising protectionism and anti-globalization sentiment, China's imports and exports with major trade partners remained strong.
During the first four months, trade with the European Union gained 15.5 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan, accounting for 14.8 percent of the total. Trade with the United States expanded 20.3 percent to 1.18 trillion yuan, making it China's second largest trade partner.
Customs data also showed that a leading indicator for China's exports rebounded from 40.2 to 40.7 month on month in April, signalling positive potential in exports.
SOFIA－Chinese and Bulgarian officials in the Bulgarian capital on April 28 voiced hopes to boost tourism cooperation, promising to make full use of the countries' unique resources.
At the opening of the conference of the "EU-China Tourism Year 2018: New Investment Opportunities for the Tourism Sector in Bulgaria", China's ambassador to Bulgaria Zhang Haizhou said: "Today's seminar reflects the strong desire of the Bulgarian side to tap its potential, improve its services and expand its market in tourism so as to attract more Chinese tourists."
He says Bulgaria "has rich, unique tourism resources, and the Bulgarian government attaches great importance to the development of the tourism industry".
Traveling to China will bring huge profits to Bulgarian tourism enterprises, he says.
"The Chinese side sincerely welcomes more Bulgarian friends to China."
A LAWYER IN GUANGZHOU, South China's Guangdong province, is suing a local expressway company after he was charged 10 yuan ($1.4) for using a highway designed to link non-adjacent towns to an expressway, which he claims he did not use. Legal Daily commented on Saturday:
The linking lanes usually have a tollgate on one end and a non-adjacent town on the other. In some cases, drivers who reach the tollgate from other lanes rather than tolled highway are still charged the extra fee. The Guangzhou lawyer is not alone in questioning whether a driver should pay for the highway linking to an expressway if he or she does not use it.
Expressway companies argue that they have the right to charge such a fee to cover the construction and maintenance costs of these lanes. While many drivers refuse to buy such an explanation because they believe that the pre-express lanes are not expressways and hence any such charges, which can be more expensive than toll fees, are illegitimate.
Of all the controversies surrounding the case, one thing is clear: Drivers should not be charged for a service they do not use. What the Guangzhou expressway company has done does not hold any legal water, despite the fact that it assumes that any driver arriving at the tollgate has used the highway providing access to the expressway.
It is unlikely that the local transportation authorities permit drivers to be charged a fee when they do not use roads that link to expressways, and even if they do, such a decision is still subject to relevant laws such as the Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests and the regulations on toll roads. If the toll authorization is misinterpreted, whether on purpose or not, the expressway company should at least explain why it did so and on what grounds it justifies charging all drivers indiscriminately.
The rapid expansion of expressway network in China is praiseworthy, but it also has caused problems. In addition to charging fees fairly and legally, local transportation officials should launch a thorough review of their road management to protect the legitimate interests of drivers.
Grandmothers play important roles for many Chinese. Unlike in the West, many of them live and grow up in a family of three to four generations.
Ni Ping, actress and one of the country's best-known TV anchors who hosted the CCTV Spring Festival Gala 12 times, establishes herself as a sincere, congenial, and empathic speaker, whose plain and full-of-life words have the power to move people to tears.
"I get that from my grandma," Ni says.
She has recorded her grandmother's quotations and memories of living with her for 50 years in a book. The book gets popular and its newest edition, published last month, invites young readers to ponder on family tradition as well as ways to return love and care to the elderly.
Ni had a difficult time when her son was found ill shortly after birth, and she had to stop working to get him treatment. It was in 1999, when her hosting career was at its peak. She was upset and began to smoke cigarettes.
It was her grandma who calmed her, and encouraged her with colloquial and simple words: "If you're not beaten, everything can be settled; if you give up and let yourself fall, nobody could help you to stand up. If you are not the one to save your kid, nobody can. Grandma believes you can."

MADRID — Maria Sharapova is not yet worried about whether she will be awarded a wild card for Wimbledon following her doping ban.
After moving into the second round of the Madrid Open on Sunday, Sharapova said it's too early to think about the July tournament.
"I mean, look, I would love to be in a position to compete in that event," she said.
"It's very meaningful to me. But it's just too far down the line right now."Sharapova defeated Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Croatia in three sets for her fourth victory since serving a 15-month ban for testing positive for meldonium at last year's Australian Open. She was eliminated in the semifinals in Stuttgart last month in her first tournament since the ban.
"I feel like I'm like a broken-record player, but these tournaments are really important," Sharapova said. "The match play that I have, getting myself in these situations, getting out of them, will ultimately help me for those big events whether I'm in there or not."Sharapova, who is also expected to play in Rome later this month, has been playing on wild-card entries because she lost her ranking following the doping suspension.
The decision on her wild card for Wimbledon may not come until June 20, according to tournament officials. The five-time Grand Slam champion and former top-ranked player will know on May 16 if she will be able to compete on a wild card in the French Open, which starts May 22.
A win in the second round in Madrid against Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, one of the most outspoken players against Sharapova's return to tennis, could be enough to let the Russian qualify for Wimbledon on points, without needing a wild card.
Bouchard, who called Sharapova "a cheater" and said she should be banned for life from tennis, was a finalist in Wimbledon in 2014. Sharapova won the 2004 title in Wimbledon.
Sharapova said playing as many matches as possible is the most important thing for her at the moment.
"I feel like it's still a learning experience, and it's still just getting back in the groove and understanding what I need to work on and improve," she said. "But those are all things that are normal and are part of the process, part of kind of the journey that I've started.
"You can train for as much as you want, but playing the matches and being in that competitive environment is just not the same. You can never replicate it," she said.
"Expectations of how I play, I'll get back into that. But, as I said, the match play is the most important thing right now."Sharapova said she is not being affected by the off-the-court controversy involving her return to tennis.
"I'm very much in my element. I think it's always great to be the person that's kind of in control of your actions while everything around you is moving in a different way," she said. "Not much has changed from my end. I still go through my routines. I still go through my training. I'm around my team. But then there's a little bit more around. I definitely feel it, but it doesn't change anything that I do.
"I'm kind of the driver of that," she said. "I like being in that position. I like doing my work. I love being quiet about it and letting everyone around speak or have the noise, whatever it is."

MADRID — While Rafael Nadal continues to thrive, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray are just trying to get back in form.
The top-ranked Murray and the second-ranked Djokovic arrive for the Madrid Open looking to regain their confidence after lackluster starts to their seasons, hoping to find their best game in time for the French Open later this month.
Nadal has won two straight titles on clay, while Murray and Djokovic have struggled on the surface so far.
For defending Madrid Open champion Djokovic, the tournament in Spain will also give him a chance to test his game after parting ways with longtime coach Marian Vajda last week.
"When you start losing more matches, you start questioning your game, yourself, what you're doing wrong so you can rectify that and get better, turn the tables around," Djokovic said Sunday. "I've been very fortunate to experience the upwards direction of my career ever since I've started. This is now a different direction a little bit. In the last six months, I haven't had too many of great results. That's why, you know, I've felt like I needed some changes and I needed to approach things maybe a little bit differently."
Djokovic won in Doha to start the year but never made it past the quarterfinals in the following four tournaments he played. Among his losses was a second-round defeat to Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin in the Australian Open. He lost to Australia's Nick Kyrgios in the quarterfinals in Acapulco and in the Round of 16 in Indian Wells. In his first clay-court tournament of the year, Djokovic was eliminated by David Goffin in the quarterfinals.
"I've played so many years on this level that I'm feeling comfortable on the tennis court regardless of these current changes," he said. "Generally, I mean, I haven't forgotten to hit the tennis ball. I've continued on more or less with the same kind of routine and approach that I've had over the years, you know, with certain changes."Murray, the runner-up to Djokovic in Madrid in 2016, also lost to the Serbian in the final in Doha earlier this year.
Murray won in Dubai, but started the clay season trying to regain his form following a right elbow injury that kept him out of the Miami Open and the Davis Cup quarterfinals.
He lost to Albert Ramos-Vinolas in the third round in Monte Carlo after blowing a 4-0 lead in the deciding set, then was eliminated by Dominic Thiem in the semifinals of the Barcelona Open.
"At the beginning of the clay season, it's always a bit trickier for me than the other surfaces just because the movement isn't as natural on this surface for me as it is on the hard courts and the grass courts," Murray said. "It takes me time. I need to work on that each year when I come back onto it a lot before I feel comfortable doing it."He said he remained optimistic for Madrid and the run-up to Roland Garros despite the disappointing result recently.
"Expectations are high. I want to do well the next few weeks," Murray said. "In many ways, it's the most important part of the year. There's a lot of big tournaments that come very quickly, one after the other. I'm motivated. The last couple of years, once I've got that part of my game right, then I feel like clay does actually suit my game well."Murray and Djokovic will likely have to get past a resurging Nadal if they are to win in Madrid.
Nadal won in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, playing well in each tournament. He has won 10 consecutive matches and is 21-1 in his past 22 sets.
Next month, the fifth-ranked Spaniard will try to win a 10th French Open title. The last of his 14 Grand Slams was three years ago at Roland Garros.

Mainland authorities call for thorough probe, ask that fishermen be respected
Mainland authorities called on Taiwan to thoroughly investigate the shooting of fishermen by the Taiwan coast guard over the weekend, to avoid similar incidents in the future.
A fishing boat from Guangdong province was seized on Saturday morning by a Taiwan patrol boat in waters near Penghu county in southeastern Taiwan.
Two of its seven crew members were injured by rubber bullets fired from the patrol boat, Taiwan authorities said. They were sent to a hospital in Penghu for medical treatment, while the other five were detained.
An Fengshan, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, called on the Taiwan side late on Saturday to respect the fact that fishermen from both sides of the Taiwan Straits have long been fishing in the area.
"Similar cases in which Taiwan has seized a mainland fishing boat have occurred frequently in recent times," An said. "We have highlighted respect for the rights of mainland fishermen several times, but another incident occurred on Saturday morning."
Taiwan should stop seizing fishing boats without sound reason for doing so, he said.
"We requested the Taiwan side take the case seriously, release the fishermen and the boat as soon as possible and prevent the recurrence of similar cases in the future."
In March, another spokesman from the office, Ma Xiaoguang, commented on reports that Taiwan authorities had detained 20 mainland fishermen and their boat on charges of illegally trespassing in waters around the Dongsha Islands.
At that time, the office said: "Taiwan should respect fishermen from both sides of the Straits, including those from Hong Kong and Macao, stop its improper treatment of fishermen and protect their lives and property."
Ma voiced opposition to acts that undermine the basis of cross-Straits talks and hinder the development of cross-Straits ties.
The mainland has offered travel conveniences to Taiwan residents for several years.
At the end of 2016, the Civil Aviation Administration of China started upgrading self-service systems at mainland airports, in a move to make buying tickets and checking-in easier for Taiwan travelers.
More than 1,700 self-service facilities are planned across the country by the end of this year, the administration said.

Jorge Luis Borges' poetry is usually considered profound and thought-provoking. But an upcoming Chinese TV series will make an effort to bring out the Argentine poet's romantic works.
The poem, written in 1934, is used by his character, a lonely entrepreneur, to win the heart of his true love.
The series will be aired on Beijing Satellite TV and the streaming site PPTV on May 11.
The cast includes mainland actress Pan Zhilin and Taiwan actresses Cherrie Ying and Elaine Jin.

Traditional Chinese medicine originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners use herbal medicines and various mind and body practices, such as acupuncture and Tai chi, to treat or prevent health problems.[Photo/Xinhua]
"It can hurt a little, but the pain does not stay, it takes maybe a few seconds then it goes away," Donnersmarck told Xinhua on Friday at an acupuncture clinic.
As a recognized authority on Traditional Chinese medicine with a degree in Western medicine, Dr. Wu has been practicing in Santa Monica for 27 years.
Donnersmarck admitted that it was scary when he saw the acupuncture needles for the first time. "Acupuncture is a very precise, careful and caring process... the doctor can not miss by a few millimeters," he told Xinhua, "With Dr. Wu, you feel so much the deep wisdom, the experience, the knowledge. I feel it so much and I trust him."
His trust paid him back. Without any surgery, Donnersmarck's problem was solved in one month. "I found that Western medicine can be very aggressive, and it has extreme side effects," Donnersmarck said. "But for Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, they do not have side effects, it is about activating the energy and oxygen flow in the body, it is about helping the body heal itself."
Another thing that Donnersmarck found impressive was how Dr. Wu takes Western medicine into consideration and uses that in Traditional Chinese medicine.

Workers test samples at an oil field in Aktobe, Kazakhstan. Ren Qi / China Daily
A Chinese company is not only pumping 'black gold' and providing jobs, but also establishing community projects for locals, reports Ren Qi in Aktobe, Kazakhstan
Editor's note: This is the ninth in a series of reports focusing on the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's proposed trading route linking Asia, Europe and Africa.
Kazakhstan holds a special place in the history of Belt and Road Initiative, because President Xi Jinping proposed the ambitious initiative during a speech at Nazarbayev University in Astana, the Kazakh capital, in 2013.
China has been working closely with Kazakhstan for about 20 years, mainly in the energy sector. That cooperation has expanded since the launch of the landmark project, which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
Aktobe, in the west, is Kazakhstan's second-largest region but it has the lowest population density in the country, with just 2.6 people per square kilometer.
It's also the location of a prime example of the strong links between the two nations: China National Petroleum Corp AktobeMunaiGas, known as CNPC AMG, Kazakhstan's fifth-largest oil and gas producer.
In June 1997, China National Petroleum Corp, the nation's largest oil and gas producer and supplier, bought a 60.34 percent stake in the Kazakh company and obtained production licenses for three oil fields and a contract for an oil exploration block.
"The acquisition was the company's first investment in Central Asia, and the development of the Aktobe project is a prime example of China's oil and gas cooperation in Kazakhstan," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan Corp, a subsidiary established to oversee operations.
Later, CNPC was awarded four more oil and gas projects in the country, along with two exploration projects and the Kazakhstan-China crude oil pipeline, the Northwest oil pipeline, and phase two of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline.
Construction of the 1,454-kilometer-long western section of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline was completed on April 14. According to the company, the pipeline can now carry more than 5 billion cubic meters a year from Kazakhstan to Chna.
"China is busy building the Silk Road Economic Belt throughout Central Asia, and we see these oil and natural gas pipelines as an 'energy Silk Road'," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan.
CNPC now holds 89.17 percent of CNPC AMG, which produced more than 134 million metric tons of crude oil and 72.3 billion cu m of natural gas between 1997 and the end of last year, according to company data.
Wang Junren, general manager of CNPC AMG, said the project has faced several challenges since it was established, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the drop in the price of oil between 2010 and 2015.
"However, thanks to a better energy cooperation environment, such as a higher oil price and positive policies introduced as part of the initiative, the development of CNPC AMG has jumped in the past two years," he said.
"The initiative is an updated version of China's international cooperation model, and the Silk Road Economic Belt is helping to raise the level of sustainable cooperation between China and Kazakhstan," he added.
Wang Yanfeng, deputy chief engineer and head of field operations in Aktobe, said the company's employees have made many sacrifices to ensure the project's success.
After working at the company's oil field in Daqing, Heilongjiang province, for seven years, Wang studied in Moscow from 2001 to 2003 to further his professional skills. After that, he moved to Kazakhstan.
"When I arrived in Aktobe, the company was in a critical situation because the price of oil had almost reached its lowest point and the business was really not smooth. Living and working conditions were also quite poor," he recalled.
The hardest thing was traveling the 270 km between the oil field and the regional capital, also called Aktobe: "The roads were bad, and there were deep potholes all the way to the field, so we had to ride in an open pickup truck for more than eight hours in winter."
Acts of charity
CNPC AMG has signed memorandums of understanding with the Aktobe regional government every year since 1997, and has donated more than $47 million to local charities.
The company has spent more than $694 million to boost local amenities, including subsidizing medical services and building infrastructure, such as hospitals and cultural or religious venues, according to Yury Shikarev, deputy director of the general manager's office.
In 2003, the company bought 80 apartments in downtown Aktobe city. It offered them to World War II veterans free of charge as part of celebrations to mark the 58th anniversary of the end of the war.
"We also spend $63,700 a year on newspaper subscriptions for the old soldiers," he said. "Furthermore, we sponsored a Veterans' Day to commemorate them, which received positive feedback from local people."
Xu Anping, deputy general manager of CNPC AMG, visits the apartments to meet with the veterans every year.
"For a company exploring natural resources in a foreign country, relations with local governments, and especially local communities, are very important," he said.
Xu was one of the first Chinese workers to arrive in Aktobe in 1997. He said the CNPC management team understood the need for positive relations and immediately set about cultivating them.
In the first year, CNPC AMG bought and renovated an old sanatorium. When the work had been completed, the company organized a three-month summer camp for the children of its Chinese and Kazakh employees.
"Now, our summer camp is one of the most famous in Aktobe, or even western Kazakhstan. It has become a fairytale land for the children of the region," Xu said, with pride.

President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Emmanuel Macron on Monday for winning the French presidential election.
Mentioning that France was the first western power to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Xi said that China-France relations have strategic significance and international influence, which have seen healthy and stable development in previous years.
In the message, Xi pointed out that as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and powers with great global influence, China and France have important duties in world peace and development.
The continuous development of China-France relations would not only benefit the people of both countries, but also contribute to global peace, stability and prosperity, he said.
China is willing to make joint efforts with France to enhance the development of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level.

Centrist Macron wins French presidential election
Emmanuel Macron will be the next president of France after decisively defeating Marine Le Pen in Sunday's second-round run-off, according to early polling issued after voting closed at 8 pm local time.
Le Pen phoned Macron to congratulate him, and he was also called by Theresa May, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and received a message from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The centrist Macron is predicted to win 65.5 percent of the vote to right-winger Le Pen's 34.45 percent. The result shows that Macron did better than previous opinion polls suggested and that Le Pen's support deteriorated during the last two weeks.




Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, the most visited museum in the world each year, plans to stop selling paper tickets from its box office, perhaps by later this year.
Shan Jixiang, the museum's director, said an Internet-based system will be set up to better coordinate the number of visitors for different hours of the day.
The new plan is preliminarily scheduled to be launched in an "appropriate time after late October", but he said it still depends on whether conditions allow. Starting in July, the museum will gradually decrease the percentage of tickets available at physical box offices.
The Palace Museum opened its online ticket system in 2011, and its statistics show nearly half the tickets are sold via the internet. The tickets sold in the box office in the first quarter of 2017 decreased by about 10 percent from the same period a year earlier.
"As the public recognition for online tickets has kept rising in recent years, there is a foundation for our plan," Shan said.
The Palace Museum, China's former royal palace from 1420 to 1911 and also known as the Forbidden City, received more than 16 million visitors in 2016.
The museum set a daily quota of 80,000 visitors in 2015 due to safety concerns caused by overcrowding.
Shan said the change is another way to handle the crowds.
The current online booking system allows visitors to buy tickets only for the following days, but Shan said visitors now will be able to buy same-day tickets during the off-season, which is November to March.
Shan said the museum will work with online booking platforms and mobile apps, as well as digital payment channels such as Alipay and WeChat Wallet.
"For those people who are not familiar with online payments, we'll leave some windows of box office open to help them," he said.
Shan said its online payment system will have English and other language versions to assist foreign visitors.
Still, the change is not welcomed by all.
"It's unfair because not all Chinese people are netizens," said Mo Yao, 29, an office worker from Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, who recently visited the Palace Museum. She did say her shopping was heavily de-pendent on online payment. "At least, some tickets should be reserved for those preferring a traditional way of purchasing.
"And, if people come to Beijing and suddenly have a desire to admire the splendor of the Forbidden City, how will they feel if they are refused?"
A response given by the Palace Museum is that "staff will patiently explain for those who don't know the policy".
According to Pan Shou-yong, a museology professor at Minzu University of China, it is premature to map out the policy. His team once conducted research showing that about 80 percent of people going to the Palace Museum were first-time visitors.
He said that while some overseas counterparts, like the Louvre museum, also have online ticket systems, none use the system as the exclusive means to sell tickets.
"It's ok if paper tickets are no longer printed, but current studies don't endorse such a plan entirely depending on online booking," Pan said.
Rail freight services linking Chinese cities with destinations across Eurasia seen as critical to boosting trade and economic ties
The trees and plants exported by Sichuan Heshengde Import and Export Trade Co used to spend up to 35 days in transit before they reached their destination markets in Europe.
After being loaded onto a truck at the company's base in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, the plants were driven to Xiamen Port on the southeast coast and transferred to a ship, which crossed the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea before docking in Europe.
Things changed in December, however, when the company switched to using a China Railway Express freight service that travels between Chengdu and the Dutch city of Tilburg in just 13 days.
"It's not only cut the travel time, but also wastage," said Gao Yunfei, assistant to Heshengde's general manager. "The rail journey has increased the survival rate of our plants by 10 percent compared with the previous shipping method.
"The plants also look much better, which means they can be sold at a higher price," he added.
To date, the company has shipped nine containers loaded with money tree plants, Chinese banyan or white willow on the freight service. Most containers are about 12 meters by 2 meters by 2 meters.
Gao said about half of Heshengde's exports now travel by train. "The price is higher, but considering the time and reduced wastage, the cost is about the same as by sea," he said. "It depends on our customers' requirements, but as the supplier, we prefer rail."
The CR Express network is helping companies throughout China and neighboring countries to improve their trade with markets in Central Asia and Europe.
China launched its first cross-border rail freight service - between Chongqing and Duisburg in Germany - in March 2011. Since then, the number has risen to 51, connecting 27 Chinese cities with 28 destinations in 11 countries.
Some 3,557 outbound and inbound journeys had been made on these routes, and that figure is expected hit 5,000 by 2020, according to a five-year development plan for the CR Express released in October by the National Development and Reform Commission.
Seventeen Chinese cities have regular scheduled services, with the busiest being Chengdu, where 10 trains depart every week. The other 10 offer chartered services.
The shortest run is between Chengdu and Lodz in Poland, which takes 12 days, while the longest starts in Yiwu in Zhejiang and ends in Madrid, covering 13,052 km in 18 days.
CR Express services utilize three key border ports: Manzhouli in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, the eastern gateway; Erenhot in Inner Mongolia, the central gateway; and Alashankou and Khorgos in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, which form the western gateway.
As a logistical option, rail freight is faster than by sea and cheaper than by air, according to the network operator, China Railway Corp, which says almost all services arrive on time. Prices are not publicly disclosed.
Plan to rebrand
China's first cross-border freight services were launched by local railway authorities, with a route's name usually made up of the departure city, the border port and the destination: Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe, for example.
Last year, the NDRC rebranded all services as CR Express as part of its development plan, which highlighted the rail links as crucial to the Belt and Road Initiative.
First proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, the initiative comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and aims to boost trade and investment between China, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
Logistics services are seen as a physical link connecting Eurasia that could prove the cornerstone for strengthening economic ties. However, the development plan states that better regulation is urgently needed to deal with the high costs, disorderly competition, inefficient customs clearance, and unsuitable infrastructure.
The plan sets a target to have three gateways and 43 transit hubs as part of the CR Express network by 2020.
China could learn from the experience of Tokyo Bay area how to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area, which this year's Government Work Report lists as a central government mission.
Bay areas are important growth points and leaders in technological innovation across the world. World Bank data show about 60 percent of the global economy is concentrated in the river delta regions, and the trend of people moving from inland areas of a country to its coasts has intensified.
The metropolitan zone in the Tokyo Bay area comprises Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures, covering an area of 13,562 square kilometers. Although the Tokyo Bay's metropolitan area adds up to only 3.5 percent of the total land of Japan, it is home to one-third of the country's population and generates one-third of national GDP.
Compared with the densely populated Tokyo Bay area, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area's population of about 100 million is more scattered and concentrated relatively away from the sea, which means there is enough room for development in the coastal areas.
The rise of the new economy, especially the service sector, in the mid-1960s when Shinkansen high-speed trains started operation, led to the influx of people from across Japan to the Tokyo Bay area, which further boosted the growth of the agglomeration economy. This in turn gave rise to big city malaise, which became increasingly serious after the area's population crossed 10 million. Surprisingly, though, after the Tokyo Bay area's population reached 40 million, the big city malaise began subsiding thanks especially to the constant improvements in urban infrastructure and management.
Opening-up gives rise to diversity, and diversity leads to efficiency. Although the Pearl River Delta region, which consists of 11 cities, is no less diverse than the Tokyo Bay area, the economic interaction among and complementarity of the cities are not up to the mark because of the wide gaps among them in terms of opening up to the outside world.
The Tokyo Bay area resorted to harsh environmental protection measures after experiencing a serious pollution crisis, which in turn caused a social crisis in the 1950s and 1960s, and succeeded in solving the industrial pollution problem while upgrading its technology and restructuring the economy.
The measures the Tokyo Bay area adopted to address the problems plaguing it could be important lessons for China to effectively manage its large metropolitan areas and improve their infrastructure, especially because the Pearl River Delta region has to improve its urban management, service sector and infrastructure, transportation in particular, to develop the coastal areas, so as to allow the agglomeration economy to truly flourish.
Besides, the prefecture-level and city-level governments in the Tokyo Bay area have established effective communication channels and mechanisms, so as to coordinate their planning, construction and development, which is exactly what the 11 cities in the Pearl River Delta region should do.
China also has to help develop strong think tanks, because they play an important role in inter-governmental exchanges and communication owing to their greater foresight. The success of the Tokyo Bay area's development indicates China's advanced manufacturing industries should shift to the great bay area to have easier access to global markets and enjoy better industrial interaction.
In all probability, the knowledge-intensive economy, supported by information and communication technology and research and development, as well as the high-end service sector will continue to move into the greater bay area. But to facilitate the process, the Pearl River Delta region needs to further open up to the outside world and be more inclusive in terms of foreign ideas and planning process.
The planning and development of the Pearl River Delta region should also make the environment a compulsory aspect of its development agenda, in order to avoid going through the painstaking and costly environmental-cleansing process of the Tokyo Bay area.

The company has introduced several pilot lockers with basketballs at the city's public and campus courts. Users can borrow and return a basketball through the company's WeChat account after paying a 29-yuan ($4.2) deposit. One basketball costs 1.5 yuan for half an hour.
The lockers are equipped with a camera to ensure the process is completed properly. According to the company, the lockers can also hold personal items for users.
A photo of the lockers was posted online by a Weibo user, China's version of Twitter, which intrigued many netizens.
"It's indeed troublesome to bring a basketball oneself. With the service, you can rent a ball near the court when you want to play and return it afterwards and don't need to be burdened by anything if you want to go somewhere else," Weibo user xiaohaierhaipi wrote.
A company staff member said the pilot project is going well in Jiaxing and the service will soon be expanded to other cities nationwide.
Too much salt may be causing excessive urination at night, scientists believe. Provided To China Daily
THE SHENYING SALT COMPANY in Pingdingshan, Central China's Henan province, is recalling its rock salt products, which customers in several provinces have complained give off the odor of smelly feet when heated. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Friday:




Although the company has recalled over 7,000 tons of its salt products and further production has been halted, there are questions unanswered: Are the salt products really "harmless" as claimed, and how did the provincial salt management bureau came to that conclusion?
Questioned about the cause of the bad smell in March, the Henan company blamed butyric acid, a harmless chemical often found in goat's milk. While an inspection by the Henan provincial salt management bureau found that the salt did not conform to national standards, it said the bad smell is caused by several chemicals that are not harmful to humans.
But the salt quality supervision and inspection station of Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu province, tested the stinky salt earlier and found nitrite traces, which are far from harmless. The investigation authorities in Tai'an, East China's Shandong province, also found hydrogen sulfide in the samples. These results warrant tests by a more authoritative third-party organization.
Why did it take the Henan authorities so long to disclose their test results is also a question worth asking. The complaints about the smelly salt were first exposed about two months ago, so too were the Nanjing and Tai'an tests, but the Henan provincial salt management bureau did not respond until the public outcry for "a proper explanation" became too loud to ignore in the past few days.
More important, it seems that those behind the scandal are yet to be held accountable. On the one hand, the substandard salt may pose a threat to public health. On the other hand, the company said in earlier reports that its products are sent to a third-party organization for quality tests every quarter. It is inconceivable that these testers did not notice the odor that was detectable even by human noses.

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.

Sunday's convincing win for Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential elections provides the EU with an opportunity to shake off its populist blues and move forward with a new unity of purpose. The Macron win was important because he was by far the most pro-EU candidate arguing that what France needed was more European integration, not less. It is no surprise that his victory was especially welcomed in Brussels.
The re-launch of the European project will not be possible before the German elections in September. But it matters little whether Angela Merkel or Martin Schulz is elected as both are solid pro-European centrist politicians. In the intervening five months you can expect a flurry of activity between Berlin, Brussels and Paris as politicians and officials work out how best to re-launch the EU that has been floating aimlessly for the past couple of years.
The reasons for the EU's malaise were the triple shock of the Greek financial crisis, the rise of populism and Brexit. The Greek crisis has been contained and the government in Athens has been granted further loans by the IMF and the EU. The fact that the European economy is showing signs of renewed growth has helped open the coffers.
The defeat of Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands is a good sign that populism has peaked and is now falling. The rise of populist parties was closely linked to the refugee crisis but this is now under control and their support is dropping. The EU has also pushed back against the policies of some populist governments (Poland and Hungary) which demonstrate that Brussels is still prepared to defend the core values of the EU.
Brexit was of course linked to the populist movement. "Take back control" was an appealing if meaningless slogan that helped the Brexiteers to victory in June 2016. The British vote was a huge shock to the political elites in Europe and occasioned much soul-searching. But oddly it has pushed the 27 member states closer together and reinforced their desire to strengthen the EU. At a succession of meetings in Bratislava, Rome and Brussels the 27 have shown a steely determination to stay united and negotiate Brexit as one. Brexit is a classic lose-lose situation but the UK may be a bigger loser than the EU.
This new confidence in the EU can be seen from its determination to stand up, with China, in support of globalisation and the multilateral system. Worried at the noises coming from the US Donald Trump administration, the EU has reinforced its determination to uphold the Paris climate change agreement and forge ahead with free trade agreements.
Brussels welcomed President Xi Jinping's Davos speech defending the fruits of globalisation. The EU now looks forward to the EU-China summit this year as an opportunity to further deepen relations. It hopes to give a push to the negotiations for a bilateral investment agreement which are viewed as a precursor to an eventual FTA. China also recognises the growing importance of the EU not only as a major market for its goods but also as a strong pillar of the multilateral system. The recent strategic dialogue meeting in Beijing between EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini and State Councillor Yang Jiechi revealed a broad consensus on many global issues.
The EU is also a strong supporter of the Belt and Road Initiative. The over-arching principle of connectivity is a concept shared by the EU and China. Both sides are already working on a number of major infrastructure projects and more will be discussed at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. Several European countries have joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank while China has joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which improves mutual understanding and transparency.
The Belt and Road Forum is an important sign of China's on-going commitment to a more global and connected world. In this endeavour the EU is a natural partner.

Even though the Republic of Korea's presidential election is just one day away, the candidates are still debating security matters rather than economic recovery and employment, because the winner will have the tough job of dealing with the security jigsaw on the Korean Peninsula.




The US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, according to claims, is operational to a large extent. And the likelihood of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducting its sixth nuclear test remains high as the United States threatens to relinquish "strategic patience".
Seoul needs deft diplomatic maneuverings, not some "defensive" weapons, to safeguard national security. The ROK's economic prospects don't look good either. The reform proposed by impeached and ousted president Park Geun-hye did little to break the plutocracy, which is still thwarting economic growth. In other words, the paradox that a government requires enough votes as well as financial support to run a country might keep haunting the new ROK administration.
The ROK presidential election is being held not only prematurely but also amid fears that a regional conflict could break out at any moment. That THAAD may be combat ready very soon will leave the new ROK president little room to take immediate strategic decisions. In fact, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party, the frontrunner in the presidential race had stressed that the final decision on THAAD should be left to the next government.
The Park administration's decision that THAAD can better counter the threat from Pyongyang (and the interim administration's ratification of the move) will make it difficult for the new ROK president to take a different course on national security.
Instead of testing its ballistic missiles, Pyongyang held its "largest ever live artillery drill" on April 25 to mark the 85th anniversary of the founding of its army. That said, Seoul will be simplifying the complex security and diplomatic issues if it places its faith in THAAD and its military alliance with Washington for safeguarding its national security.
The paramount security risk facing the ROK is the DPRK's nuclear program, whose longevity has a lot to do with the mixed defense structure in Northeast Asia. Rather than working closely with China, an important party to the global denuclearization efforts, the ROK chose to depend on its military alliance with the US and Japan for its national security.
US President Donald Trump has said that he wants a diplomatic resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue despite warning of a "major, major" conflict with the DPRK. In this context, the ROK could help resolve the disputes surrounding the DPRK nuclear issue.
Peaceful handling of the nuclear issue is at the core of the interests of both Seoul and Beijing, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry has reiterated China's strong opposition to the DPRK's nuclear and missile tests.
The new ROK president may have an unenviable job on hand, with the country's security and diplomatic situation approaching a turning point. There is hope, though, because strategic patience and delicate maneuverings have not yet exhausted. In this regard, concerted efforts to resume the Kaesong Industrial Complex in the DPRK's border town, restart the tours to the DPRK's Mount Kumgang resort, and recalibrate China-ROK relations would be more than worth the trouble.

The Palace Museum in Beijing, also called the Forbidden City, said on Friday that it will open its first permanent satellite gallery outside Beijing on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, Fujian province, on May 13.
The Kulangsu Gallery of Foreign Artifacts from the Palace Museum Collections will be in a former hospital that was set up by a Dutch-American missionary in 1898.
The opening exhibition features 219 artifacts including antique clocks, scientific instruments and paintings from abroad. They come from the 16th to the early 20th century.
The artifacts were chosen from the Palace Museum's collection of some 10,000 foreign artifacts, many of which were brought by missionaries and diplomats to the court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Because the museum has lacked a space to present the items, most of those going on display in Xiamen have long been stored in warehouses.
"The Palace Museum has the responsibility to find a place to show the artifacts to give the public a wider view of the world's civilization," said Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. "Due to historical reasons, in Western museums, we can see many items from abroad, but such institutions are quite rare in China."
Gulangyu Island, a top tourist spot once called Kulangsu, hosted the settlements of 13 countries from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, making the 1.88-square-kilometer island a cultural melting pot.
"The island is a center of historical architecture from many countries," Shan said. "Its atmosphere echoes our exhibits from overseas, and is thus a perfect place to display them."
Gulangyu's bid to become a World Heritage Site will be taken up at a UNESCO conference in Poland in July. Ni Chao, a standing member of the Xiamen committee of the Communist Party of China, said the new, 5,168-square-meter museum will be a bonus for the island's cultural landscape.

The cost of living in Asian cities generally increased last year, with Singapore remaining at the top for the fourth consecutive year. But exchange rate volatility and resurgent commodity prices, rather than productivity gains, were responsible for the increase.
Asia remains the most diverse region in terms of the cost of living. Ironically, with several major agricultural and manufacturing product exporters, East Asian cities tend to be the world's priciest places for tradable products, such as general grocery and clothing.
Asian cities continue to climb up the world cost of living ladder, accounting for half of the 10 most expensive cities in the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Exchange rate volatility was the major factor that determined the cost of living in cities. With the strength of the US dollar moderating and the euro remaining relatively stable, currencies such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar have gained in value, ending up with higher relative cost. Underpinned by a stronger yen, Tokyo and Osaka have returned to the 10 most expensive cities' list, by climbing up seven and nine places. And Seoul, supported by currency and income growth, has moved up two places to the 6th spot.
The steady depreciation of the yuan and weaker consumer sentiment have dragged down living costs in China. Five Chinese mainland cities－Beijing, Suzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Dalian－are among the biggest movers down the ranking ladder in the past year. Shanghai remains the most expensive city in the Chinese mainland, though its relative costs are lower. The city is 8 percent cheaper than New York City now compared with just 3 percent 12 months ago. The city used to be as expensive as Tokyo, but is now cheaper than not only Tokyo and Osaka but also Sydney and Melbourne.
Asian cities' rankings are characterized by extremes, the most expensive and the cheapest. Singapore and Hong Kong continue to be the most and second-most expensive cities, while cities such as Colombo, Kathmandu, New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karachi and Bangalore represent the best value for money in Asia and are among the 30 cheapest in the world because of lower incomes and closer links to domestic agriculture and manufacturing supply chains.
A closer look at the most expensive cities shows Asian cities tend to form the priciest locations for tradable goods, such as grocery and daily necessities. Yet they offer non-tradable goods at much lower prices than European cities. This perhaps reflects a greater premium on discretionary spending for better quality products, such as organic food, branded clothes and advanced electronic products, in high-income cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo. The grocery products many Asian countries, such as China and Malaysia, export often do not match the demand for wealthier Asian countries' premium consumption.
Government subsidy is another important factor that decides Asian cities' ranks. Grocery prices in cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea, for instance, are among the highest in the world.
In Seoul, topping up a grocery basket is almost 50 percent more expensive than in New York City. The average price of a 1-kilogram loaf of bread in Seoul is 140 percent more than in New Delhi, and much higher than in China, Malaysia, New Zealand, which export agricultural products. Due to limited domestic arable land, the ROK relies on imports of agricultural products, but with high tariffs to protect its domestic agricultural industry, it ends up with very high grocery prices. In India, one sees the opposite trend. To reduce hunger, India provides subsidies for staple foods and other agricultural products, lowering the cost of foods.
In the long run, this divergence is likely to persist and Asian cities are expected to become relatively more expensive as emerging economies continue to supply much of the world's wage and demand growth. But the capacity for economic shocks and currency swings could make the ride quite bumpy.

Jan Rinnert, chairman of Heraeus, a family-owned German company engaged in precious and special metals, sensors, specialty light sources, quartz glass and medical technology PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Led by Jan Rinnert, Germany's Heraeus expects China's initiative to spawn digital infrastructure
Overseeing a business as tough as precious metal recycling, thick film pastes and water decontamination, Jan Rinnert, chairman of German technology company Heraeus, has long recognized the importance of adding a human touch to his management philosophy.
It may have been derived from his earlier experience as a local government spokesperson, where he grasped the art of articulating a view, or, later, as a management consultant role in which he learned a slew of business best practices.
"I've always believed in the power in people. My father once told me never to look for a job, but to search for the right individual that you report to and learn from," he said.
Since taking the helm of the one of the most renowned family-run companies in Germany, Rinnert strives to become the "approachable" leader and role model for his 12,500 employees around the globe.
His frankness in leadership is exemplified by a number of initiatives to engage with staff, such as the "open space dialogue" where employees get to raise thorny questions from the outlook of the European Union to personal distractions.
"I was once asked by a Chinese colleague if our businesses would be dragged down by the gloomy outlook of the European Union following Brexit. That's when you realize they are absolutely the most valuable assets of the company," he said.
Founded in 1851 in Hanau, a city near Frankfurt, Heraeus may not be a household name, but it has a sizable presence globally by virtue of its business, which is providing materials and solutions to markets like environment, energy, health and transport. It also provides industrial applications from power electronics systems to electric vehicles, and engages in trading in precious metals such as platinum and gold.
Like many of its German peers, Heraeus is a "Hidden Champion"－a term coined by management consultant Hermann Simon to describe smaller companies that are among the top three of a niche market－with the only problem being it has grown a bit too big to be invisible now.
Sales in 2016 topped $20 billion with a satisfying level of margin, according to Rinnert, whose company does not disclose financial details and chooses to stay private.
"As a family(-run) company, we've never considered an initial public offering. Diversification remains a route to long-term growth. Under one roof, we aim to run eight hidden champions that are all independent, all leaders in their respective niche markets, while leveraging the company's synergies to grow along," he said.
That vision, in part, was made possible thanks to an overhaul plan led by Rinnert in 2014 to turn Heraeus into a portfolio company, by making business units more market-oriented and eliminating several levels of hierarchy.
Today, its portfolio ranges from components to coordinated material systems used in a wide variety of industries, including steel, electronics, chemical, automotive and telecommunications.
But this does not indicate an inward-looking business strategy. Its latest acquisition of Swiss precious metal processor Argor-Heraeus in April would help kick up a notch in processing capacity for gold and silver.
The buyout accords with an earlier investment in China, where Heraeus broke ground for a plant in Nanjing last year to boost capacity in recycling precious metals and manufacturing chemicals, to grow its local market share to 20 percent by 2020.
As the largest precious metals company in the world and one of the very few companies licensed to trade in precious metals in China, Heraeus has been present in the country for 40 years and generates 30 percent of its entire revenue from here.
In the eyes of Rinnert, the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) has laid a solid ground for Chinese companies to embark on technological breakthroughs and shed over-capacities through the supply-side structural reform, guidelines that are in line with what his company could offer.
"Retaining existing technology is not an option－that's the key learning from my family business. That's not easy because you are challenging the status quo. But automation, advanced manufacturing, and other things Chinese are doing is the way ahead to make businesses sustain," he said.
The Belt and Road Initiative will lend new momentum to growth, he said. "It's a visionary initiative. Today, it's more focused on physical infrastructure investment, with substantial financial systems in place such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as the cornerstone. In the future, we look forward to the digital and data infrastructure building where there is a larger role for us to play."
Rinnert further said the initiative would require extra efforts and coordination for public-private partnerships. It is a subject where Europe has experience and can share that with China.
But it is still the forthcoming cultural and people-to-people exchanges that matter the most, he said.
"I often recall my first startup company that hosted a number of DJs prior to college. That experience helped me deal with pressure, and know my strengths and limits. Today, I see the younger generation in China who are well-educated, digital-savvy and understand the complexity of the environment. I've a lot to expect from you."

An attractive voice can get you a recording contract, but in China, talking the talk can get you thousands of followers, dollars and a career as a video game anchor.
China is one of the biggest video game markets in the world, having generated 50.46 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) in revenue in 2016.
The tremendous growth in internet penetration rate and the ubiquity of personal devices and handsets have supported the growing trend of the sport at the beginning of the 21st century. In recent years, the popularity of live streaming platforms has led to the rise of a different kind of competition within the gaming industry: battle of the video gaming hosts.
The stakes are high undoubtedly, as anchors have to strike a chord with more than 100 million users religiously following live streaming platforms for video gaming.
JY from Beijing is a celebrity video gaming anchor. The 30-year-old man, known as "the lord of eSports," fell in love with video gaming in high school. He later sacrificed his college entrance exams to focus on becoming one of China's first professional video players… and he made it, eventually.

However, the beginning was not without road bumps. JY told Yangtze Evening Post that his income was around 500 to 800 yuan ($72-115) initially. The financial crisis in 2007 forced him to develop a second career as a video game anchor, which turned out to be a great success thanks to his gaming skills and popularity among online users, which he accumulated after six years of professional gaming.
The average online viewership of YJ's videos can reach 400,000. And today, JY makes a six-figure income annually.
"The money comes from the live streaming platforms I signed with, the Taobao store I run, gifts from fans, advertisements of video game developers implanted during live streaming, and my startups," he said.
"But few people can reach the top of the pyramid in this field. Most commentators don't even have an income," YJ added.

Popularity is a survival key. An anchor's worth essentially depends on the fans they have. But how to get users to follow at times competition is cutthroat?
Gaming techniques, talking styles, good looks and strong commitment are crucial.
Once one tick the right boxes, being the next Han Yiying, an eSport hostess who reportedly signed a three-year contract with live streaming platform Huya at 90 million yuan ($130,000) last year, won't be virtual reality.
SOFIA－Chinese and Bulgarian officials in the Bulgarian capital on April 28 voiced hopes to boost tourism cooperation, promising to make full use of the countries' unique resources.
At the opening of the conference of the "EU-China Tourism Year 2018: New Investment Opportunities for the Tourism Sector in Bulgaria", China's ambassador to Bulgaria Zhang Haizhou said: "Today's seminar reflects the strong desire of the Bulgarian side to tap its potential, improve its services and expand its market in tourism so as to attract more Chinese tourists."
He says Bulgaria "has rich, unique tourism resources, and the Bulgarian government attaches great importance to the development of the tourism industry".
Traveling to China will bring huge profits to Bulgarian tourism enterprises, he says.

Sunday's convincing win for Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential elections provides the EU with an opportunity to shake off its populist blues and move forward with a new unity of purpose. The Macron win was important because he was by far the most pro-EU candidate arguing that what France needed was more European integration, not less. It is no surprise that his victory was especially welcomed in Brussels.
The re-launch of the European project will not be possible before the German elections in September. But it matters little whether Angela Merkel or Martin Schulz is elected as both are solid pro-European centrist politicians. In the intervening five months you can expect a flurry of activity between Berlin, Brussels and Paris as politicians and officials work out how best to re-launch the EU that has been floating aimlessly for the past couple of years.
The reasons for the EU's malaise were the triple shock of the Greek financial crisis, the rise of populism and Brexit. The Greek crisis has been contained and the government in Athens has been granted further loans by the IMF and the EU. The fact that the European economy is showing signs of renewed growth has helped open the coffers.
The defeat of Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands is a good sign that populism has peaked and is now falling. The rise of populist parties was closely linked to the refugee crisis but this is now under control and their support is dropping. The EU has also pushed back against the policies of some populist governments (Poland and Hungary) which demonstrate that Brussels is still prepared to defend the core values of the EU.
Brexit was of course linked to the populist movement. "Take back control" was an appealing if meaningless slogan that helped the Brexiteers to victory in June 2016. The British vote was a huge shock to the political elites in Europe and occasioned much soul-searching. But oddly it has pushed the 27 member states closer together and reinforced their desire to strengthen the EU. At a succession of meetings in Bratislava, Rome and Brussels the 27 have shown a steely determination to stay united and negotiate Brexit as one. Brexit is a classic lose-lose situation but the UK may be a bigger loser than the EU.
This new confidence in the EU can be seen from its determination to stand up, with China, in support of globalisation and the multilateral system. Worried at the noises coming from the US Donald Trump administration, the EU has reinforced its determination to uphold the Paris climate change agreement and forge ahead with free trade agreements.
Brussels welcomed President Xi Jinping's Davos speech defending the fruits of globalisation. The EU now looks forward to the EU-China summit this year as an opportunity to further deepen relations. It hopes to give a push to the negotiations for a bilateral investment agreement which are viewed as a precursor to an eventual FTA. China also recognises the growing importance of the EU not only as a major market for its goods but also as a strong pillar of the multilateral system. The recent strategic dialogue meeting in Beijing between EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini and State Councillor Yang Jiechi revealed a broad consensus on many global issues.
The EU is also a strong supporter of the Belt and Road Initiative. The over-arching principle of connectivity is a concept shared by the EU and China. Both sides are already working on a number of major infrastructure projects and more will be discussed at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. Several European countries have joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank while China has joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which improves mutual understanding and transparency.
The Belt and Road Forum is an important sign of China's on-going commitment to a more global and connected world. In this endeavour the EU is a natural partner.

An attractive voice can get you a recording contract, but in China, talking the talk can get you thousands of followers, dollars and a career as a video game anchor.
China is one of the biggest video game markets in the world, having generated 50.46 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) in revenue in 2016.
The tremendous growth in internet penetration rate and the ubiquity of personal devices and handsets have supported the growing trend of the sport at the beginning of the 21st century. In recent years, the popularity of live streaming platforms has led to the rise of a different kind of competition within the gaming industry: battle of the video gaming hosts.
The stakes are high undoubtedly, as anchors have to strike a chord with more than 100 million users religiously following live streaming platforms for video gaming.
JY from Beijing is a celebrity video gaming anchor. The 30-year-old man, known as "the lord of eSports," fell in love with video gaming in high school. He later sacrificed his college entrance exams to focus on becoming one of China's first professional video players… and he made it, eventually.

However, the beginning was not without road bumps. JY told Yangtze Evening Post that his income was around 500 to 800 yuan ($72-115) initially. The financial crisis in 2007 forced him to develop a second career as a video game anchor, which turned out to be a great success thanks to his gaming skills and popularity among online users, which he accumulated after six years of professional gaming.
The average online viewership of YJ's videos can reach 400,000. And today, JY makes a six-figure income annually.
"The money comes from the live streaming platforms I signed with, the Taobao store I run, gifts from fans, advertisements of video game developers implanted during live streaming, and my startups," he said.
"But few people can reach the top of the pyramid in this field. Most commentators don't even have an income," YJ added.

Popularity is a survival key. An anchor's worth essentially depends on the fans they have. But how to get users to follow at times competition is cutthroat?
Gaming techniques, talking styles, good looks and strong commitment are crucial.
Once one tick the right boxes, being the next Han Yiying, an eSport hostess who reportedly signed a three-year contract with live streaming platform Huya at 90 million yuan ($130,000) last year, won't be virtual reality.

A Chinese company is not only pumping 'black gold' and providing jobs, but also establishing community projects for locals, reports Ren Qi in Aktobe, Kazakhstan
Editor's note: This is the ninth in a series of reports focusing on the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's proposed trading route linking Asia, Europe and Africa.
Kazakhstan holds a special place in the history of Belt and Road Initiative, because President Xi Jinping proposed the ambitious initiative during a speech at Nazarbayev University in Astana, the Kazakh capital, in 2013.
China has been working closely with Kazakhstan for about 20 years, mainly in the energy sector. That cooperation has expanded since the launch of the landmark project, which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
Aktobe, in the west, is Kazakhstan's second-largest region but it has the lowest population density in the country, with just 2.6 people per square kilometer.
It's also the location of a prime example of the strong links between the two nations: China National Petroleum Corp AktobeMunaiGas, known as CNPC AMG, Kazakhstan's fifth-largest oil and gas producer.
In June 1997, China National Petroleum Corp, the nation's largest oil and gas producer and supplier, bought a 60.34 percent stake in the Kazakh company and obtained production licenses for three oil fields and a contract for an oil exploration block.
"The acquisition was the company's first investment in Central Asia, and the development of the Aktobe project is a prime example of China's oil and gas cooperation in Kazakhstan," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan Corp, a subsidiary established to oversee operations.
Later, CNPC was awarded four more oil and gas projects in the country, along with two exploration projects and the Kazakhstan-China crude oil pipeline, the Northwest oil pipeline, and phase two of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline.
Construction of the 1,454-kilometer-long western section of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline was completed on April 14. According to the company, the pipeline can now carry more than 5 billion cubic meters a year from Kazakhstan to Chna.
"China is busy building the Silk Road Economic Belt throughout Central Asia, and we see these oil and natural gas pipelines as an 'energy Silk Road'," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan.
CNPC now holds 89.17 percent of CNPC AMG, which produced more than 134 million metric tons of crude oil and 72.3 billion cu m of natural gas between 1997 and the end of last year, according to company data.
Wang Junren, general manager of CNPC AMG, said the project has faced several challenges since it was established, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the drop in the price of oil between 2010 and 2015.
"However, thanks to a better energy cooperation environment, such as a higher oil price and positive policies introduced as part of the initiative, the development of CNPC AMG has jumped in the past two years," he said.
"The initiative is an updated version of China's international cooperation model, and the Silk Road Economic Belt is helping to raise the level of sustainable cooperation between China and Kazakhstan," he added.
Wang Yanfeng, deputy chief engineer and head of field operations in Aktobe, said the company's employees have made many sacrifices to ensure the project's success.
After working at the company's oil field in Daqing, Heilongjiang province, for seven years, Wang studied in Moscow from 2001 to 2003 to further his professional skills. After that, he moved to Kazakhstan.
"When I arrived in Aktobe, the company was in a critical situation because the price of oil had almost reached its lowest point and the business was really not smooth. Living and working conditions were also quite poor," he recalled.
The hardest thing was traveling the 270 km between the oil field and the regional capital, also called Aktobe: "The roads were bad, and there were deep potholes all the way to the field, so we had to ride in an open pickup truck for more than eight hours in winter."
Acts of charity
CNPC AMG has signed memorandums of understanding with the Aktobe regional government every year since 1997, and has donated more than $47 million to local charities.
The company has spent more than $694 million to boost local amenities, including subsidizing medical services and building infrastructure, such as hospitals and cultural or religious venues, according to Yury Shikarev, deputy director of the general manager's office.
In 2003, the company bought 80 apartments in downtown Aktobe city. It offered them to World War II veterans free of charge as part of celebrations to mark the 58th anniversary of the end of the war.
"We also spend $63,700 a year on newspaper subscriptions for the old soldiers," he said. "Furthermore, we sponsored a Veterans' Day to commemorate them, which received positive feedback from local people."
Xu Anping, deputy general manager of CNPC AMG, visits the apartments to meet with the veterans every year.
"For a company exploring natural resources in a foreign country, relations with local governments, and especially local communities, are very important," he said.
Xu was one of the first Chinese workers to arrive in Aktobe in 1997. He said the CNPC management team understood the need for positive relations and immediately set about cultivating them.
In the first year, CNPC AMG bought and renovated an old sanatorium. When the work had been completed, the company organized a three-month summer camp for the children of its Chinese and Kazakh employees.
"Now, our summer camp is one of the most famous in Aktobe, or even western Kazakhstan. It has become a fairytale land for the children of the region," Xu said, with pride.

MADRID — While Rafael Nadal continues to thrive, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray are just trying to get back in form.
The top-ranked Murray and the second-ranked Djokovic arrive for the Madrid Open looking to regain their confidence after lackluster starts to their seasons, hoping to find their best game in time for the French Open later this month.
Nadal has won two straight titles on clay, while Murray and Djokovic have struggled on the surface so far.
For defending Madrid Open champion Djokovic, the tournament in Spain will also give him a chance to test his game after parting ways with longtime coach Marian Vajda last week.
"When you start losing more matches, you start questioning your game, yourself, what you're doing wrong so you can rectify that and get better, turn the tables around," Djokovic said Sunday. "I've been very fortunate to experience the upwards direction of my career ever since I've started. This is now a different direction a little bit. In the last six months, I haven't had too many of great results. That's why, you know, I've felt like I needed some changes and I needed to approach things maybe a little bit differently."
Djokovic won in Doha to start the year but never made it past the quarterfinals in the following four tournaments he played. Among his losses was a second-round defeat to Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin in the Australian Open. He lost to Australia's Nick Kyrgios in the quarterfinals in Acapulco and in the Round of 16 in Indian Wells. In his first clay-court tournament of the year, Djokovic was eliminated by David Goffin in the quarterfinals.
"I've played so many years on this level that I'm feeling comfortable on the tennis court regardless of these current changes," he said. "Generally, I mean, I haven't forgotten to hit the tennis ball. I've continued on more or less with the same kind of routine and approach that I've had over the years, you know, with certain changes."Murray, the runner-up to Djokovic in Madrid in 2016, also lost to the Serbian in the final in Doha earlier this year.
Murray won in Dubai, but started the clay season trying to regain his form following a right elbow injury that kept him out of the Miami Open and the Davis Cup quarterfinals.
He lost to Albert Ramos-Vinolas in the third round in Monte Carlo after blowing a 4-0 lead in the deciding set, then was eliminated by Dominic Thiem in the semifinals of the Barcelona Open.
"At the beginning of the clay season, it's always a bit trickier for me than the other surfaces just because the movement isn't as natural on this surface for me as it is on the hard courts and the grass courts," Murray said. "It takes me time. I need to work on that each year when I come back onto it a lot before I feel comfortable doing it."He said he remained optimistic for Madrid and the run-up to Roland Garros despite the disappointing result recently.
"Expectations are high. I want to do well the next few weeks," Murray said. "In many ways, it's the most important part of the year. There's a lot of big tournaments that come very quickly, one after the other. I'm motivated. The last couple of years, once I've got that part of my game right, then I feel like clay does actually suit my game well."Murray and Djokovic will likely have to get past a resurging Nadal if they are to win in Madrid.
Nadal won in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, playing well in each tournament. He has won 10 consecutive matches and is 21-1 in his past 22 sets.
Next month, the fifth-ranked Spaniard will try to win a 10th French Open title. The last of his 14 Grand Slams was three years ago at Roland Garros.

A LAWYER IN GUANGZHOU, South China's Guangdong province, is suing a local expressway company after he was charged 10 yuan ($1.4) for using a highway designed to link non-adjacent towns to an expressway, which he claims he did not use. Legal Daily commented on Saturday:
The linking lanes usually have a tollgate on one end and a non-adjacent town on the other. In some cases, drivers who reach the tollgate from other lanes rather than tolled highway are still charged the extra fee. The Guangzhou lawyer is not alone in questioning whether a driver should pay for the highway linking to an expressway if he or she does not use it.
Expressway companies argue that they have the right to charge such a fee to cover the construction and maintenance costs of these lanes. While many drivers refuse to buy such an explanation because they believe that the pre-express lanes are not expressways and hence any such charges, which can be more expensive than toll fees, are illegitimate.
Of all the controversies surrounding the case, one thing is clear: Drivers should not be charged for a service they do not use. What the Guangzhou expressway company has done does not hold any legal water, despite the fact that it assumes that any driver arriving at the tollgate has used the highway providing access to the expressway.
It is unlikely that the local transportation authorities permit drivers to be charged a fee when they do not use roads that link to expressways, and even if they do, such a decision is still subject to relevant laws such as the Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests and the regulations on toll roads. If the toll authorization is misinterpreted, whether on purpose or not, the expressway company should at least explain why it did so and on what grounds it justifies charging all drivers indiscriminately.
The rapid expansion of expressway network in China is praiseworthy, but it also has caused problems. In addition to charging fees fairly and legally, local transportation officials should launch a thorough review of their road management to protect the legitimate interests of drivers.
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also called the Forbidden City, said on Friday that it will open its first permanent satellite gallery outside Beijing on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, Fujian province, on May 13.
The Kulangsu Gallery of Foreign Artifacts from the Palace Museum Collections will be in a former hospital that was set up by a Dutch-American missionary in 1898.
The opening exhibition features 219 artifacts including antique clocks, scientific instruments and paintings from abroad. They come from the 16th to the early 20th century.
The artifacts were chosen from the Palace Museum's collection of some 10,000 foreign artifacts, many of which were brought by missionaries and diplomats to the court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Because the museum has lacked a space to present the items, most of those going on display in Xiamen have long been stored in warehouses.
"The Palace Museum has the responsibility to find a place to show the artifacts to give the public a wider view of the world's civilization," said Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. "Due to historical reasons, in Western museums, we can see many items from abroad, but such institutions are quite rare in China."
Gulangyu Island, a top tourist spot once called Kulangsu, hosted the settlements of 13 countries from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, making the 1.88-square-kilometer island a cultural melting pot.
"The island is a center of historical architecture from many countries," Shan said. "Its atmosphere echoes our exhibits from overseas, and is thus a perfect place to display them."
Gulangyu's bid to become a World Heritage Site will be taken up at a UNESCO conference in Poland in July. Ni Chao, a standing member of the Xiamen committee of the Communist Party of China, said the new, 5,168-square-meter museum will be a bonus for the island's cultural landscape.




Over 500 artists from 22 countries will attend the annual cultural event this year. It runs through May 31.
The play will be staged at Tsinghua University on May 20 and 21.
Directed by Kirill Glushajev and performed by the actors and actresses of the State Small Theatre of Vilnius, the play tells the story of Vassa Zheleznova, a woman whose alcoholic husband assaults her and does not do enough for their son while alive. She works in a factory for years and raises her son but eventually she and her son clash.
"The conflicts between materialism and spirituality, and between sociability and individualism have been presented well in The Mother. We may see it as a Lithuanian story but at the same time it's recognizable in every society," says Glushajev.
"I am more interested in the conflict between humans as individuals, especially in a family, rather than between different societies or ideologies," the 33-year-old director adds.
Lithuanian actress Egle Gabrenaite, who leads the cast as the mother in the play, has done more than 60 stage roles.

The Palace Museum in Beijing, the most visited museum in the world each year, plans to stop selling paper tickets from its box office, perhaps by later this year.
Shan Jixiang, the museum's director, said an Internet-based system will be set up to better coordinate the number of visitors for different hours of the day.
The new plan is preliminarily scheduled to be launched in an "appropriate time after late October", but he said it still depends on whether conditions allow. Starting in July, the museum will gradually decrease the percentage of tickets available at physical box offices.
The Palace Museum opened its online ticket system in 2011, and its statistics show nearly half the tickets are sold via the internet. The tickets sold in the box office in the first quarter of 2017 decreased by about 10 percent from the same period a year earlier.
"As the public recognition for online tickets has kept rising in recent years, there is a foundation for our plan," Shan said.
The Palace Museum, China's former royal palace from 1420 to 1911 and also known as the Forbidden City, received more than 16 million visitors in 2016.
The museum set a daily quota of 80,000 visitors in 2015 due to safety concerns caused by overcrowding.
Shan said the change is another way to handle the crowds.
The current online booking system allows visitors to buy tickets only for the following days, but Shan said visitors now will be able to buy same-day tickets during the off-season, which is November to March.
Shan said the museum will work with online booking platforms and mobile apps, as well as digital payment channels such as Alipay and WeChat Wallet.
"For those people who are not familiar with online payments, we'll leave some windows of box office open to help them," he said.
Shan said its online payment system will have English and other language versions to assist foreign visitors.
Still, the change is not welcomed by all.
"It's unfair because not all Chinese people are netizens," said Mo Yao, 29, an office worker from Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, who recently visited the Palace Museum. She did say her shopping was heavily de-pendent on online payment. "At least, some tickets should be reserved for those preferring a traditional way of purchasing.
"And, if people come to Beijing and suddenly have a desire to admire the splendor of the Forbidden City, how will they feel if they are refused?"
A response given by the Palace Museum is that "staff will patiently explain for those who don't know the policy".
According to Pan Shou-yong, a museology professor at Minzu University of China, it is premature to map out the policy. His team once conducted research showing that about 80 percent of people going to the Palace Museum were first-time visitors.
He said that while some overseas counterparts, like the Louvre museum, also have online ticket systems, none use the system as the exclusive means to sell tickets.
"It's ok if paper tickets are no longer printed, but current studies don't endorse such a plan entirely depending on online booking," Pan said.
As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.

President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Emmanuel Macron on Monday for winning the French presidential election.
Mentioning that France was the first western power to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Xi said that China-France relations have strategic significance and international influence, which have seen healthy and stable development in previous years.
In the message, Xi pointed out that as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and powers with great global influence, China and France have important duties in world peace and development.
The continuous development of China-France relations would not only benefit the people of both countries, but also contribute to global peace, stability and prosperity, he said.
China is willing to make joint efforts with France to enhance the development of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level.

Centrist Macron wins French presidential election
Emmanuel Macron will be the next president of France after decisively defeating Marine Le Pen in Sunday's second-round run-off, according to early polling issued after voting closed at 8 pm local time.
Le Pen phoned Macron to congratulate him, and he was also called by Theresa May, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and received a message from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The centrist Macron is predicted to win 65.5 percent of the vote to right-winger Le Pen's 34.45 percent. The result shows that Macron did better than previous opinion polls suggested and that Le Pen's support deteriorated during the last two weeks.

LONDON — Arsene Wenger got the better of managerial rival Jose Mourinho for the first time in a competitive game as Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday to keep alive its Champions League qualification hopes.
Granit Xhaka, with a deflected shot, and former United player Danny Welbeck, with a bullet header, scored goals in a four-minute span early in the second half to end United's 25-match unbeaten in the league dating to October.
This was the 16th competitive head to head between Wenger and Mourinho — and the 13th in league play — since 2004. It has been a one-sided rivalry but Wenger finally got a victory over the man who once dubbed him a "specialist in failure," for a result that might end United's chances of a top-four finish and leaves Arsenal with some hope.
"Finally, I leave this (Emirates) stadium with Arsenal fans happy," Mourinho said. "It's the first time I see them smile, enjoy."Arsenal moved two points behind fifth-place United with a game in hand, and is seven points behind third-placed Liverpool having played two games fewer and six behind fourth-placed Manchester City having played one game fewer. Wenger's team has four matches remaining to earn a 20th straight season in the Champions League.
"We still have a mathematical chance but we need some help," Wenger said. "But the best help we can get is by winning our own games."A disappointing game burst into life in the 54th when Xhaka, afforded plenty of space in central midfield following a throw-in, advanced and sent in a 30-meter (yard) shot that struck the turned back of Ander Herrera and looped over goalkeeper David de Gea.
Welbeck, who was sold to Arsenal in 2014 to end a 13-year association with United, has now scored in each of his last three appearances against his old club after powering a header in off the bar in the 57th from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross.
Mourinho made eight changes to his starting team from the 1-0 win over Celta Vigo in the first leg of the Europa League semifinals on Thursday. The second leg is at Old Trafford on Thursday and Mourinho has suggested the European competition, which offers a place in the Champions League for the winner, is his priority for the remainder of the season.
"Of course, we knew we were not coming in our maximum power," Mourinho said. "Thursday is the match of the season."It meant the 19-year-old Axel Tuanzebe was handed his Premier League debut, at right back up against Alexis Sanchez, and he performed excellently. Scott McTominay, a 20-year-old midfielder, came on as a second-half substitute for his first-team debut while Paul Pogba — the world's most expensive player — didn't even come off the bench.
United hasn't scored away to a top-six rival all season.
Arsenal will climb above United with a win at Southampton on Wednesday.

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.

WeChat is already one of China's most popular mobile payment methods. Now the social media app, owned by Internet giant Tencent, is teaming up with Silicon mobile payment startup Citcon to take its services to the US market.
Through WeChat accounts, users will be able to pay for whatever they need in Chinese currency renminbi without cash, just as they do in China.
For four consecutive years, China has been the world number one outbound tourism country, accounting for over 13 percent of the total tourism revenue globally. The United States has been one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travelers.
"Last year, over 100 million Chinese people traveled outside of China. Once they see this place can accept WeChat Pay, they can use their mobile phones. They certainly receive much warmer welcomes‍ from foreign countries," according to Chuck Huang, CEO of Citcon.
Mobile payment is the new frontier of commerce, and China is leading this trend. By providing an easy-to-use mobile payment and cross-border marketing solution, WeChat is empowering global merchants to connect with millions of Chinese consumers.
Currently, WeChat Pay is available in 15 countries and regions, for payments in 12 foreign currencies.
Tencent has now joined Apple and Google-parent Alphabet in the ranks of the world's biggest firms by market capitalization, with a value of more than 302 billion US dollars. Shares in the tech company hit a record high on Tuesday.
It's the only firm outside the US among the world's top 10 most valuable companies.‍
Jan Rinnert, chairman of Heraeus, a family-owned German company engaged in precious and special metals, sensors, specialty light sources, quartz glass and medical technology PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Led by Jan Rinnert, Germany's Heraeus expects China's initiative to spawn digital infrastructure
Overseeing a business as tough as precious metal recycling, thick film pastes and water decontamination, Jan Rinnert, chairman of German technology company Heraeus, has long recognized the importance of adding a human touch to his management philosophy.
It may have been derived from his earlier experience as a local government spokesperson, where he grasped the art of articulating a view, or, later, as a management consultant role in which he learned a slew of business best practices.
"I've always believed in the power in people. My father once told me never to look for a job, but to search for the right individual that you report to and learn from," he said.
Since taking the helm of the one of the most renowned family-run companies in Germany, Rinnert strives to become the "approachable" leader and role model for his 12,500 employees around the globe.
His frankness in leadership is exemplified by a number of initiatives to engage with staff, such as the "open space dialogue" where employees get to raise thorny questions from the outlook of the European Union to personal distractions.
"I was once asked by a Chinese colleague if our businesses would be dragged down by the gloomy outlook of the European Union following Brexit. That's when you realize they are absolutely the most valuable assets of the company," he said.
Founded in 1851 in Hanau, a city near Frankfurt, Heraeus may not be a household name, but it has a sizable presence globally by virtue of its business, which is providing materials and solutions to markets like environment, energy, health and transport. It also provides industrial applications from power electronics systems to electric vehicles, and engages in trading in precious metals such as platinum and gold.
Like many of its German peers, Heraeus is a "Hidden Champion"－a term coined by management consultant Hermann Simon to describe smaller companies that are among the top three of a niche market－with the only problem being it has grown a bit too big to be invisible now.
Sales in 2016 topped $20 billion with a satisfying level of margin, according to Rinnert, whose company does not disclose financial details and chooses to stay private.
"As a family(-run) company, we've never considered an initial public offering. Diversification remains a route to long-term growth. Under one roof, we aim to run eight hidden champions that are all independent, all leaders in their respective niche markets, while leveraging the company's synergies to grow along," he said.
That vision, in part, was made possible thanks to an overhaul plan led by Rinnert in 2014 to turn Heraeus into a portfolio company, by making business units more market-oriented and eliminating several levels of hierarchy.
Today, its portfolio ranges from components to coordinated material systems used in a wide variety of industries, including steel, electronics, chemical, automotive and telecommunications.
But this does not indicate an inward-looking business strategy. Its latest acquisition of Swiss precious metal processor Argor-Heraeus in April would help kick up a notch in processing capacity for gold and silver.
The buyout accords with an earlier investment in China, where Heraeus broke ground for a plant in Nanjing last year to boost capacity in recycling precious metals and manufacturing chemicals, to grow its local market share to 20 percent by 2020.
As the largest precious metals company in the world and one of the very few companies licensed to trade in precious metals in China, Heraeus has been present in the country for 40 years and generates 30 percent of its entire revenue from here.
In the eyes of Rinnert, the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) has laid a solid ground for Chinese companies to embark on technological breakthroughs and shed over-capacities through the supply-side structural reform, guidelines that are in line with what his company could offer.
"Retaining existing technology is not an option－that's the key learning from my family business. That's not easy because you are challenging the status quo. But automation, advanced manufacturing, and other things Chinese are doing is the way ahead to make businesses sustain," he said.
The Belt and Road Initiative will lend new momentum to growth, he said. "It's a visionary initiative. Today, it's more focused on physical infrastructure investment, with substantial financial systems in place such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as the cornerstone. In the future, we look forward to the digital and data infrastructure building where there is a larger role for us to play."
Rinnert further said the initiative would require extra efforts and coordination for public-private partnerships. It is a subject where Europe has experience and can share that with China.
But it is still the forthcoming cultural and people-to-people exchanges that matter the most, he said.
"I often recall my first startup company that hosted a number of DJs prior to college. That experience helped me deal with pressure, and know my strengths and limits. Today, I see the younger generation in China who are well-educated, digital-savvy and understand the complexity of the environment. I've a lot to expect from you."

Now, let's take a look at the main characters in the film.
The ancient music of the Hani people faces decline, Chen Nan reports in Yuanyang county, Yunnan province.
He sits alone on a bench in the sun, surrounded by people, most of whom are tourists.
This is Zhu Xiaohe, a 79-year-old man from the Hani ethnic group, who lives in the village of Dongpu in Southwest China's Yunnan province.
The village is located in Yuanyang county, in the Honghe Hani and Yi autonomous prefecture of Yunnan.
In 2007, he became the first in his ethnic group to be recognized as an inheritor of this form of intangible culture.
He sings ancient Hani songs, or haba.
Too much salt may be causing excessive urination at night, scientists believe. Provided To China Daily
THE SHENYING SALT COMPANY in Pingdingshan, Central China's Henan province, is recalling its rock salt products, which customers in several provinces have complained give off the odor of smelly feet when heated. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Friday:




Although the company has recalled over 7,000 tons of its salt products and further production has been halted, there are questions unanswered: Are the salt products really "harmless" as claimed, and how did the provincial salt management bureau came to that conclusion?
Questioned about the cause of the bad smell in March, the Henan company blamed butyric acid, a harmless chemical often found in goat's milk. While an inspection by the Henan provincial salt management bureau found that the salt did not conform to national standards, it said the bad smell is caused by several chemicals that are not harmful to humans.
But the salt quality supervision and inspection station of Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu province, tested the stinky salt earlier and found nitrite traces, which are far from harmless. The investigation authorities in Tai'an, East China's Shandong province, also found hydrogen sulfide in the samples. These results warrant tests by a more authoritative third-party organization.
Why did it take the Henan authorities so long to disclose their test results is also a question worth asking. The complaints about the smelly salt were first exposed about two months ago, so too were the Nanjing and Tai'an tests, but the Henan provincial salt management bureau did not respond until the public outcry for "a proper explanation" became too loud to ignore in the past few days.
More important, it seems that those behind the scandal are yet to be held accountable. On the one hand, the substandard salt may pose a threat to public health. On the other hand, the company said in earlier reports that its products are sent to a third-party organization for quality tests every quarter. It is inconceivable that these testers did not notice the odor that was detectable even by human noses.
Jorge Luis Borges' poetry is usually considered profound and thought-provoking. But an upcoming Chinese TV series will make an effort to bring out the Argentine poet's romantic works.
The poem, written in 1934, is used by his character, a lonely entrepreneur, to win the heart of his true love.
The series will be aired on Beijing Satellite TV and the streaming site PPTV on May 11.
The cast includes mainland actress Pan Zhilin and Taiwan actresses Cherrie Ying and Elaine Jin.

The cost of living in Asian cities generally increased last year, with Singapore remaining at the top for the fourth consecutive year. But exchange rate volatility and resurgent commodity prices, rather than productivity gains, were responsible for the increase.
Asia remains the most diverse region in terms of the cost of living. Ironically, with several major agricultural and manufacturing product exporters, East Asian cities tend to be the world's priciest places for tradable products, such as general grocery and clothing.
Asian cities continue to climb up the world cost of living ladder, accounting for half of the 10 most expensive cities in the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Exchange rate volatility was the major factor that determined the cost of living in cities. With the strength of the US dollar moderating and the euro remaining relatively stable, currencies such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar have gained in value, ending up with higher relative cost. Underpinned by a stronger yen, Tokyo and Osaka have returned to the 10 most expensive cities' list, by climbing up seven and nine places. And Seoul, supported by currency and income growth, has moved up two places to the 6th spot.
The steady depreciation of the yuan and weaker consumer sentiment have dragged down living costs in China. Five Chinese mainland cities－Beijing, Suzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Dalian－are among the biggest movers down the ranking ladder in the past year. Shanghai remains the most expensive city in the Chinese mainland, though its relative costs are lower. The city is 8 percent cheaper than New York City now compared with just 3 percent 12 months ago. The city used to be as expensive as Tokyo, but is now cheaper than not only Tokyo and Osaka but also Sydney and Melbourne.
Asian cities' rankings are characterized by extremes, the most expensive and the cheapest. Singapore and Hong Kong continue to be the most and second-most expensive cities, while cities such as Colombo, Kathmandu, New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karachi and Bangalore represent the best value for money in Asia and are among the 30 cheapest in the world because of lower incomes and closer links to domestic agriculture and manufacturing supply chains.
A closer look at the most expensive cities shows Asian cities tend to form the priciest locations for tradable goods, such as grocery and daily necessities. Yet they offer non-tradable goods at much lower prices than European cities. This perhaps reflects a greater premium on discretionary spending for better quality products, such as organic food, branded clothes and advanced electronic products, in high-income cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo. The grocery products many Asian countries, such as China and Malaysia, export often do not match the demand for wealthier Asian countries' premium consumption.
Government subsidy is another important factor that decides Asian cities' ranks. Grocery prices in cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea, for instance, are among the highest in the world.
In Seoul, topping up a grocery basket is almost 50 percent more expensive than in New York City. The average price of a 1-kilogram loaf of bread in Seoul is 140 percent more than in New Delhi, and much higher than in China, Malaysia, New Zealand, which export agricultural products. Due to limited domestic arable land, the ROK relies on imports of agricultural products, but with high tariffs to protect its domestic agricultural industry, it ends up with very high grocery prices. In India, one sees the opposite trend. To reduce hunger, India provides subsidies for staple foods and other agricultural products, lowering the cost of foods.
In the long run, this divergence is likely to persist and Asian cities are expected to become relatively more expensive as emerging economies continue to supply much of the world's wage and demand growth. But the capacity for economic shocks and currency swings could make the ride quite bumpy.

China could learn from the experience of Tokyo Bay area how to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area, which this year's Government Work Report lists as a central government mission.
Bay areas are important growth points and leaders in technological innovation across the world. World Bank data show about 60 percent of the global economy is concentrated in the river delta regions, and the trend of people moving from inland areas of a country to its coasts has intensified.
The metropolitan zone in the Tokyo Bay area comprises Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures, covering an area of 13,562 square kilometers. Although the Tokyo Bay's metropolitan area adds up to only 3.5 percent of the total land of Japan, it is home to one-third of the country's population and generates one-third of national GDP.
Compared with the densely populated Tokyo Bay area, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area's population of about 100 million is more scattered and concentrated relatively away from the sea, which means there is enough room for development in the coastal areas.
The rise of the new economy, especially the service sector, in the mid-1960s when Shinkansen high-speed trains started operation, led to the influx of people from across Japan to the Tokyo Bay area, which further boosted the growth of the agglomeration economy. This in turn gave rise to big city malaise, which became increasingly serious after the area's population crossed 10 million. Surprisingly, though, after the Tokyo Bay area's population reached 40 million, the big city malaise began subsiding thanks especially to the constant improvements in urban infrastructure and management.
Opening-up gives rise to diversity, and diversity leads to efficiency. Although the Pearl River Delta region, which consists of 11 cities, is no less diverse than the Tokyo Bay area, the economic interaction among and complementarity of the cities are not up to the mark because of the wide gaps among them in terms of opening up to the outside world.
The Tokyo Bay area resorted to harsh environmental protection measures after experiencing a serious pollution crisis, which in turn caused a social crisis in the 1950s and 1960s, and succeeded in solving the industrial pollution problem while upgrading its technology and restructuring the economy.
The measures the Tokyo Bay area adopted to address the problems plaguing it could be important lessons for China to effectively manage its large metropolitan areas and improve their infrastructure, especially because the Pearl River Delta region has to improve its urban management, service sector and infrastructure, transportation in particular, to develop the coastal areas, so as to allow the agglomeration economy to truly flourish.
Besides, the prefecture-level and city-level governments in the Tokyo Bay area have established effective communication channels and mechanisms, so as to coordinate their planning, construction and development, which is exactly what the 11 cities in the Pearl River Delta region should do.
China also has to help develop strong think tanks, because they play an important role in inter-governmental exchanges and communication owing to their greater foresight. The success of the Tokyo Bay area's development indicates China's advanced manufacturing industries should shift to the great bay area to have easier access to global markets and enjoy better industrial interaction.
In all probability, the knowledge-intensive economy, supported by information and communication technology and research and development, as well as the high-end service sector will continue to move into the greater bay area. But to facilitate the process, the Pearl River Delta region needs to further open up to the outside world and be more inclusive in terms of foreign ideas and planning process.
The planning and development of the Pearl River Delta region should also make the environment a compulsory aspect of its development agenda, in order to avoid going through the painstaking and costly environmental-cleansing process of the Tokyo Bay area.

File photo shows Seoungju residents chant slogans during a protest against the government's decision on deploying a US THAAD anti-missile defense unit in Seongju, in Seoul, South Korea, July 21, 2016. The banner reads "Desperately oppose deploying THAAD". [Photo/Agencies]
Even though the Republic of Korea's presidential election is just one day away, the candidates are still debating security matters rather than economic recovery and employment, because the winner will have the tough job of dealing with the security jigsaw on the Korean Peninsula.




The US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, according to claims, is operational to a large extent. And the likelihood of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducting its sixth nuclear test remains high as the United States threatens to relinquish "strategic patience".
Seoul needs deft diplomatic maneuverings, not some "defensive" weapons, to safeguard national security. The ROK's economic prospects don't look good either. The reform proposed by impeached and ousted president Park Geun-hye did little to break the plutocracy, which is still thwarting economic growth. In other words, the paradox that a government requires enough votes as well as financial support to run a country might keep haunting the new ROK administration.
The ROK presidential election is being held not only prematurely but also amid fears that a regional conflict could break out at any moment. That THAAD may be combat ready very soon will leave the new ROK president little room to take immediate strategic decisions. In fact, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party, the frontrunner in the presidential race had stressed that the final decision on THAAD should be left to the next government.
The Park administration's decision that THAAD can better counter the threat from Pyongyang (and the interim administration's ratification of the move) will make it difficult for the new ROK president to take a different course on national security.
Instead of testing its ballistic missiles, Pyongyang held its "largest ever live artillery drill" on April 25 to mark the 85th anniversary of the founding of its army. That said, Seoul will be simplifying the complex security and diplomatic issues if it places its faith in THAAD and its military alliance with Washington for safeguarding its national security.
The paramount security risk facing the ROK is the DPRK's nuclear program, whose longevity has a lot to do with the mixed defense structure in Northeast Asia. Rather than working closely with China, an important party to the global denuclearization efforts, the ROK chose to depend on its military alliance with the US and Japan for its national security.
US President Donald Trump has said that he wants a diplomatic resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue despite warning of a "major, major" conflict with the DPRK. In this context, the ROK could help resolve the disputes surrounding the DPRK nuclear issue.
Peaceful handling of the nuclear issue is at the core of the interests of both Seoul and Beijing, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry has reiterated China's strong opposition to the DPRK's nuclear and missile tests.
The new ROK president may have an unenviable job on hand, with the country's security and diplomatic situation approaching a turning point. There is hope, though, because strategic patience and delicate maneuverings have not yet exhausted. In this regard, concerted efforts to resume the Kaesong Industrial Complex in the DPRK's border town, restart the tours to the DPRK's Mount Kumgang resort, and recalibrate China-ROK relations would be more than worth the trouble.

A basketball-sharing locker is seen in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province. [Photo/Weibo]




The company has introduced several pilot lockers with basketballs at the city's public and campus courts. Users can borrow and return a basketball through the company's WeChat account after paying a 29-yuan ($4.2) deposit. One basketball costs 1.5 yuan for half an hour.
The lockers are equipped with a camera to ensure the process is completed properly. According to the company, the lockers can also hold personal items for users.
A photo of the lockers was posted online by a Weibo user, China's version of Twitter, which intrigued many netizens.
"It's indeed troublesome to bring a basketball oneself. With the service, you can rent a ball near the court when you want to play and return it afterwards and don't need to be burdened by anything if you want to go somewhere else," Weibo user xiaohaierhaipi wrote.
A company staff member said the pilot project is going well in Jiaxing and the service will soon be expanded to other cities nationwide.
Traditional Chinese medicine originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners use herbal medicines and various mind and body practices, such as acupuncture and Tai chi, to treat or prevent health problems.[Photo/Xinhua]
"It can hurt a little, but the pain does not stay, it takes maybe a few seconds then it goes away," Donnersmarck told Xinhua on Friday at an acupuncture clinic.
As a recognized authority on Traditional Chinese medicine with a degree in Western medicine, Dr. Wu has been practicing in Santa Monica for 27 years.
Donnersmarck admitted that it was scary when he saw the acupuncture needles for the first time. "Acupuncture is a very precise, careful and caring process... the doctor can not miss by a few millimeters," he told Xinhua, "With Dr. Wu, you feel so much the deep wisdom, the experience, the knowledge. I feel it so much and I trust him."
His trust paid him back. Without any surgery, Donnersmarck's problem was solved in one month. "I found that Western medicine can be very aggressive, and it has extreme side effects," Donnersmarck said. "But for Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, they do not have side effects, it is about activating the energy and oxygen flow in the body, it is about helping the body heal itself."
Another thing that Donnersmarck found impressive was how Dr. Wu takes Western medicine into consideration and uses that in Traditional Chinese medicine.
Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.
A Chinese lawyer on trial for subversion has denied claims he was tortured while in police detention.
Xie Yang, of Hunan province, is accused of subversion and "disrupting court order", a charge similar to contempt of court.
At a hearing at Changsha Intermediate People's Court on Monday morning, the 45-year-old said the police and prosecutors had adequately protected his legal rights.
He said the authorities did not use torture to force a confession, adding that he has "not suffered torture", according to footage of the trial released on Sina Weibo.
The court also posted a transcript of the hearing online.
Police placed Xie under investigation in July 2015 and arrested him on Jan 8 last year, according to prosecutors.
The trial was attended by more than 40 people, including Xie's relatives and attorneys, legislators and political advisers.
The hearing was also open to journalists from foreign and domestic media organizations.
Rail freight services linking Chinese cities with destinations across Eurasia seen as critical to boosting trade and economic ties
The trees and plants exported by Sichuan Heshengde Import and Export Trade Co used to spend up to 35 days in transit before they reached their destination markets in Europe.
After being loaded onto a truck at the company's base in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, the plants were driven to Xiamen Port on the southeast coast and transferred to a ship, which crossed the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea before docking in Europe.
Things changed in December, however, when the company switched to using a China Railway Express freight service that travels between Chengdu and the Dutch city of Tilburg in just 13 days.
"It's not only cut the travel time, but also wastage," said Gao Yunfei, assistant to Heshengde's general manager. "The rail journey has increased the survival rate of our plants by 10 percent compared with the previous shipping method.
"The plants also look much better, which means they can be sold at a higher price," he added.
To date, the company has shipped nine containers loaded with money tree plants, Chinese banyan or white willow on the freight service. Most containers are about 12 meters by 2 meters by 2 meters.
Gao said about half of Heshengde's exports now travel by train. "The price is higher, but considering the time and reduced wastage, the cost is about the same as by sea," he said. "It depends on our customers' requirements, but as the supplier, we prefer rail."
The CR Express network is helping companies throughout China and neighboring countries to improve their trade with markets in Central Asia and Europe.
China launched its first cross-border rail freight service - between Chongqing and Duisburg in Germany - in March 2011. Since then, the number has risen to 51, connecting 27 Chinese cities with 28 destinations in 11 countries.
Some 3,557 outbound and inbound journeys had been made on these routes, and that figure is expected hit 5,000 by 2020, according to a five-year development plan for the CR Express released in October by the National Development and Reform Commission.
Seventeen Chinese cities have regular scheduled services, with the busiest being Chengdu, where 10 trains depart every week. The other 10 offer chartered services.
The shortest run is between Chengdu and Lodz in Poland, which takes 12 days, while the longest starts in Yiwu in Zhejiang and ends in Madrid, covering 13,052 km in 18 days.
CR Express services utilize three key border ports: Manzhouli in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, the eastern gateway; Erenhot in Inner Mongolia, the central gateway; and Alashankou and Khorgos in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, which form the western gateway.
As a logistical option, rail freight is faster than by sea and cheaper than by air, according to the network operator, China Railway Corp, which says almost all services arrive on time. Prices are not publicly disclosed.
Plan to rebrand
China's first cross-border freight services were launched by local railway authorities, with a route's name usually made up of the departure city, the border port and the destination: Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe, for example.
Last year, the NDRC rebranded all services as CR Express as part of its development plan, which highlighted the rail links as crucial to the Belt and Road Initiative.
First proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, the initiative comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and aims to boost trade and investment between China, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
Logistics services are seen as a physical link connecting Eurasia that could prove the cornerstone for strengthening economic ties. However, the development plan states that better regulation is urgently needed to deal with the high costs, disorderly competition, inefficient customs clearance, and unsuitable infrastructure.
The plan sets a target to have three gateways and 43 transit hubs as part of the CR Express network by 2020.

MADRID — Maria Sharapova is not yet worried about whether she will be awarded a wild card for Wimbledon following her doping ban.
After moving into the second round of the Madrid Open on Sunday, Sharapova said it's too early to think about the July tournament.
"I mean, look, I would love to be in a position to compete in that event," she said.
"It's very meaningful to me. But it's just too far down the line right now."Sharapova defeated Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Croatia in three sets for her fourth victory since serving a 15-month ban for testing positive for meldonium at last year's Australian Open. She was eliminated in the semifinals in Stuttgart last month in her first tournament since the ban.
"I feel like I'm like a broken-record player, but these tournaments are really important," Sharapova said. "The match play that I have, getting myself in these situations, getting out of them, will ultimately help me for those big events whether I'm in there or not."Sharapova, who is also expected to play in Rome later this month, has been playing on wild-card entries because she lost her ranking following the doping suspension.
The decision on her wild card for Wimbledon may not come until June 20, according to tournament officials. The five-time Grand Slam champion and former top-ranked player will know on May 16 if she will be able to compete on a wild card in the French Open, which starts May 22.
A win in the second round in Madrid against Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, one of the most outspoken players against Sharapova's return to tennis, could be enough to let the Russian qualify for Wimbledon on points, without needing a wild card.
Bouchard, who called Sharapova "a cheater" and said she should be banned for life from tennis, was a finalist in Wimbledon in 2014. Sharapova won the 2004 title in Wimbledon.
Sharapova said playing as many matches as possible is the most important thing for her at the moment.
"I feel like it's still a learning experience, and it's still just getting back in the groove and understanding what I need to work on and improve," she said. "But those are all things that are normal and are part of the process, part of kind of the journey that I've started.
"You can train for as much as you want, but playing the matches and being in that competitive environment is just not the same. You can never replicate it," she said.
"Expectations of how I play, I'll get back into that. But, as I said, the match play is the most important thing right now."Sharapova said she is not being affected by the off-the-court controversy involving her return to tennis.
"I'm very much in my element. I think it's always great to be the person that's kind of in control of your actions while everything around you is moving in a different way," she said. "Not much has changed from my end. I still go through my routines. I still go through my training. I'm around my team. But then there's a little bit more around. I definitely feel it, but it doesn't change anything that I do.
"I'm kind of the driver of that," she said. "I like being in that position. I like doing my work. I love being quiet about it and letting everyone around speak or have the noise, whatever it is."

Grandmothers play important roles for many Chinese. Unlike in the West, many of them live and grow up in a family of three to four generations.
Ni Ping, actress and one of the country's best-known TV anchors who hosted the CCTV Spring Festival Gala 12 times, establishes herself as a sincere, congenial, and empathic speaker, whose plain and full-of-life words have the power to move people to tears.
"I get that from my grandma," Ni says.
She has recorded her grandmother's quotations and memories of living with her for 50 years in a book. The book gets popular and its newest edition, published last month, invites young readers to ponder on family tradition as well as ways to return love and care to the elderly.
Ni had a difficult time when her son was found ill shortly after birth, and she had to stop working to get him treatment. It was in 1999, when her hosting career was at its peak. She was upset and began to smoke cigarettes.
It was her grandma who calmed her, and encouraged her with colloquial and simple words: "If you're not beaten, everything can be settled; if you give up and let yourself fall, nobody could help you to stand up. If you are not the one to save your kid, nobody can. Grandma believes you can."

BEIJING - China's foreign trade surplus widened in April as import growth decline outpaced that of exports, customs data showed Monday.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.3 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan ($179.8 billion), down from the 22.3-percent increase in March.
Imports expanded 18.6 percent to 979.1 billion yuan, compared with a 26.3-percent increase a month ago.
That leaves a trade surplus of 262.3 billion yuan, up 0.6 percent year on year. The surplus widened from 164.3 billion yuan seen in March.
In the first four months, total trade volume added up to 8.42 trillion yuan, up 20.3 percent year on year.
While the April trade growth fell short of expectations, customs data reflected improved trade structure.
In the first four months, general trade expanded 21.6 percent year on year to 4.75 trillion yuan, accounting for 56.5 percent of the total trade volume.
Trade of private enterprises grew 21.7 percent to 3.17 trillion yuan in the first four months, accounting for 37.6 percent of the total, and 0.4 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
Despite rising protectionism and anti-globalization sentiment, China's imports and exports with major trade partners remained strong.
During the first four months, trade with the European Union gained 15.5 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan, accounting for 14.8 percent of the total. Trade with the United States expanded 20.3 percent to 1.18 trillion yuan, making it China's second largest trade partner.
Customs data also showed that a leading indicator for China's exports rebounded from 40.2 to 40.7 month on month in April, signalling positive potential in exports.
Mainland authorities call for thorough probe, ask that fishermen be respected
Mainland authorities called on Taiwan to thoroughly investigate the shooting of fishermen by the Taiwan coast guard over the weekend, to avoid similar incidents in the future.
A fishing boat from Guangdong province was seized on Saturday morning by a Taiwan patrol boat in waters near Penghu county in southeastern Taiwan.
Two of its seven crew members were injured by rubber bullets fired from the patrol boat, Taiwan authorities said. They were sent to a hospital in Penghu for medical treatment, while the other five were detained.
An Fengshan, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, called on the Taiwan side late on Saturday to respect the fact that fishermen from both sides of the Taiwan Straits have long been fishing in the area.
"Similar cases in which Taiwan has seized a mainland fishing boat have occurred frequently in recent times," An said. "We have highlighted respect for the rights of mainland fishermen several times, but another incident occurred on Saturday morning."
Taiwan should stop seizing fishing boats without sound reason for doing so, he said.
"We requested the Taiwan side take the case seriously, release the fishermen and the boat as soon as possible and prevent the recurrence of similar cases in the future."
In March, another spokesman from the office, Ma Xiaoguang, commented on reports that Taiwan authorities had detained 20 mainland fishermen and their boat on charges of illegally trespassing in waters around the Dongsha Islands.
At that time, the office said: "Taiwan should respect fishermen from both sides of the Straits, including those from Hong Kong and Macao, stop its improper treatment of fishermen and protect their lives and property."
Ma voiced opposition to acts that undermine the basis of cross-Straits talks and hinder the development of cross-Straits ties.
The mainland has offered travel conveniences to Taiwan residents for several years.
At the end of 2016, the Civil Aviation Administration of China started upgrading self-service systems at mainland airports, in a move to make buying tickets and checking-in easier for Taiwan travelers.
More than 1,700 self-service facilities are planned across the country by the end of this year, the administration said.

Belt and Road has support of 100-plus countries, international organizations
When a train approached a freight railway station in Warsaw, Poland, on June 20, President Xi Jinping, who was making a state visit to the country, happily bit into a red apple, as did his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda.
The two leaders were attending a ceremony to mark the arrival of the first China-Europe Block Train, carrying Chinese-made products, including electronic components, to Warsaw. When the train returned to China, it was laden with Polish commodities, including produce, such as apples.
Boosting the interconnection of Asia and the rest of the world－the purpose of the China-Europe Block Train－is one of the goals of the China-proposed Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, collectively known as the Belt and Road Initiative.
The initiative, put forward by Xi in 2013, has become one of the most important public goods China offers the world and a key vehicle for Beijing to help improve global governance.
China has invested more than $50 billion in the programs related to the initiative and has won the support of over 100 countries and international organizations－more than 40 have signed cooperation agreements with China.
At least 28 heads of state and government will attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on May 14 and 15 in Beijing. The forum will be the highest-profile international meeting on the Belt and Road since the initiative was put forward.
Xi will attend the opening ceremony and host a roundtable leaders summit. The meeting is expected to translate the ambitious blueprint into solid progress and turn a new page on the initiative.
According to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the results of the forum will range from consensus-building to specific measures on implementation. China expects to sign agreements with about 20 countries and 20 international organizations at the event.
Launched by China, shared by the world
During his visit to Kazakhstan in September 2013, Xi proposed building the Silk Road Economic Belt to boost regional cooperation. A month later, in a speech to the Indonesian parliament, he put forward a proposal to jointly establish the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
With its guiding principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, the initiative has been defined by Xi as "a chorus of all countries along the routes, not only for China itself".
During his overseas trips in the past years, Xi repeatedly called on the countries－including in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America－to cooperate with China on the initiative.
"Instead of seeking any sphere of influence, China calls on all countries to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road," he said in a speech in January 2016 at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.
The past three years have witnessed the launch, expansion, faster-than-expected progress and fruitful outcomes of the Belt and Road Initiative.
According to the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, Chinese businesses have invested more than $50 billion in countries along the Belt and Road and have helped to build 56 economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 of those countries, generating nearly $1.1 billion in tax revenue and 180,000 local jobs.
"Through the Belt and Road Initiative, I want to share China's development opportunities with the countries along the routes and achieve joint prosperity," Xi said in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the business leader's forum of the G20 in September.
The Belt and Road Initiative has been widely recognized in the international community, showing that it is in accord with the will of the people, Xi said while visiting a port in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region last month.
Wang Yiwei, a professor at Renmin University of China's School of International Relations, said that since the launch of the initiative, China has been sharing its expertise in fields such as infrastructure construction and clean energy with countries and regions along the routes.
Though proposed by China, the initiative is an open, inclusive proposal and welcomes participation from all sides, he said.
Injecting impetus intoglobal economy
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation meets an increasingly urgent need for a new cooperation platform that brings countries together to pull the world out of the economic mire and inject fresh energy into interconnected development.
Last year, the world experienced the worst economic hardship since the global financial crisis, with a 13-percent drop in foreign direct investment and weak trade growth.
Chinese companies' investment in countries along the Belt and Road routes have resulted in a number of major projects, which contributed to those countries' economic growth, Xi said in January in his keynote speech at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland.
A series of major transportation, energy and communication projects, including the multipurpose road-rail Padma Bridge in Bangladesh, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and China Railway Express trains to Europe, have advanced over the past three years along with the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.
In November 2014, Xi announced that China will contribute $40 billion to set up the Silk Road Fund to boost infrastructure and resource development while improving industrial and financial cooperation along the centuries-old Silk Road trading routes.
In 2015, China set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to provide financing for infrastructure improvement in Asia. The AIIB has 70 members, so far, and its total lending fund amounts to over $2 billion.
China is pushing forward six economic corridors in the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative: the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, the China-Mongolia-Russia corridor, the China-Central Asia-West Asia corridor, the China-Indochina Peninsula corridor, the China-Pakistan corridor and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar corridor.
The six corridors form together a trade and transport network across Eurasia, laying a solid foundation for regional and trans-regional development plans.
Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, said the international community has higher expectations for China now, at a time when the global economic recovery lacks power.
"The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will hopefully help drive away the clouds of the economic doldrums and channel more positivity to global economic growth," he said.

The United States is Chinese tourists' top destination for road trips overseas. PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Chinese are increasingly preferring road trips overseas as the preferred way to travel and soak in sights and cultures. The United States remains their top destination with Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco being particularly popular.
The US is followed by New Zealand, Germany, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, in terms of popularity, according to a recent report Tuniu Corp, an online travel agency based in Nanjing.
Besides, the United Arab of Emirates, Belgium and France are growing in popularity as Chinese driving licenses are valid there.
The top five cities where self-driving outbound Chinese tourists come from are Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing. These cities have more than two million car owners, making them more likely to travel in their own vehicles in China and in rented cars abroad.
Currently, there are more than 360 million car drivers in China, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
"The growth of holidays marked by car drives is frequently associated with wealth, freedom, and choice, and a growing middle-class in China," said Alex Yan, COO of Tuniu Corp.
"Meanwhile, we found that Chinese road trippers prefer to stay at nicer hotels, but not motels near the roads. More than 80 percent of the them usually stay at four-star or five-star hotels."
The majority of tourists who prefer self-driving trips are aged between 21 and 40, with those aged between 31 and 40 dominating this group. Most of them are affluent and tend to pursue unique trip experiences. Besides, many of them have young children and road trips fulfil their demand for travel with kids.
Lily Min, 26, an office worker in Beijing, said she and her boyfriend last year traveled to Hawaii, where they rented a red convertible.
"Hawaii is large and it's inconvenient to travel around if you don't rent a car or travel with a group. It feels really cool to drive by ourselves, as we have greater control over our time. And it's not expensive to rent a car－it costs less than $100 per day," she said.
Overseas road trips tend to take longer than an average trip. About half of these trips last year lasted 11 to15 days.
Domestic road trips are also proving to be popular. Among the well-received weekend getaways are Zhuhai and Guangzhou in Guangdong province, and Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
Longer domestic road trips to Tibet, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are also popular among Chinese tourists. About half of the domestic road trips last six to 10 days.




China never lacks access to quality animation productions. The difficulty lies in how to translate them successfully and adapt them into the market, but young Chinese animation creators are on the move. Zhang Xingjian reports.
These hit animations may shape several vivid characters, have fascinating animation effects or boast an interesting yet rigorous storyline. However, they are seldom made in China. But that trend could be in the past.
Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France on Sunday with a business-friendly vision of European integration, defeating Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist who threatened to take France out of the European Union, early projections showed.
The centrist's emphatic victory, which also smashed the dominance of France’s mainstream parties, will bring huge reliefto European allies who had feared another populist upheaval to follow Britain's vote to quit the EU and Donald Trump's election as US president.
Five projections, issued within minutes of polling stations closing at 8 pm (1800 GMT), showed Macron beating Le Pen byaround 65 percent to 35 - a gap wider than the 20 or so percentage points that pre-election surveys had pointed to.
Even so, it was a record performance for the National Front,a party whose anti-immigrant policies until recently made it apariah in French politics, and underlined the scale of the divisions that Macron must now try to heal.
Le Pen's high-spending, anti-globalisation 'France-first'policies may have unnerved financial markets but they appealedto many poorer members of society against a background of highunemployment, social tensions and security concerns.
Macron's immediate challenge will be to secure a majority innext month's parliamentary election for En Marche! (Onwards!),his political movement that is barely a year old, in order toimplement his programme.
The 39-year-old former investment banker, who served for twoyears as economy minister but has never previously held electedoffice, will become France's youngest leader since Napoleon with a promise to transcend outdated left-right divisions.
At least one opinion poll published in the run-up to thesecond round has indicated that the majority he needs could bewithin reach.
Despite having served briefly as economy minister inPresident Francois Hollande's deeply unpopular Socialistgovernment, Macron managed to portray himself as the man torecast a political landscape moulded by the left-right divisionsof the last century.
While Macron sees France's way forward in boosting thecompetitiveness of an open economy, Le Pen wanted to shieldFrench workers by closing borders, quitting the EU's commoncurrency the euro, radically loosening the bloc and scrappingtrade deals.
Socialist Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuze said France hadchosen to retain its place at the heart of Europe.
Shortly after the first projections were published, Le Pen,48, said she had congratulated Macron. But she defiantly claimedthe mantle of France's main opposition in calling on "allpatriots to join us" in constituting a "new political force".
Her deputy said this new force would not be called "NationalFront".
When he moves into the Elysee Palace after his inaugurationnext weekend, Macron will become the eighth - and youngest -president of France's Fifth Republic.
He plans to blend a big reduction in public spending and arelaxation of labour laws with greater investment in training.
A European integrationist and pro-NATO, he is orthodox inforeign and defence policy and shows no sign of wishing tochange France's traditional alliances or re-shape its militaryand peace-keeping roles in the Middle East and Africa.
His election also represents a long-awaited generationalchange in French politics that have been dominated by the samefaces for years.
He will be the youngest leader in the current Group of Seven(G7) major nations and has elicited comparisons with youthfulleaders past and present, from Canadian Prime Minister JustinTrudeau to British ex-premier Tony Blair and even President JohnF. Kennedy in the United States.

Opportunities for us to work together
The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, has become the most promising platform for international cooperation. The initiative, comprising the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, has drawn a growing number of participants thanks to its global influence. More than 100 countries and international organizations support the initiative, while over 40 have signed cooperation agreements with China.
The initiative has added fresh impetus to China and the rest of the world to promote globalization and build a "community of shared destiny of humankind", which UN Security Council Resolution 2344 of March 17 referred to while calling for regional economic cooperation to promote sustainable growth in Afghanistan. The reference to a community of shared destiny of humankind in the resolution reflects the extent of China's contribution to global governance.
The UN reference was followed by New Zealand signing a memorandum of understanding on cooperation with China on March 31, indicating that more developed countries could join the Belt and Road Initiative.
Moreover, the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank already has 70 members, more than both the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. The AIIB, in fact, is the world's largest multilateral development organization after the World Bank, and has five of the G7 countries as members.
Still, some scholars in the United States doubt the intentions of China's initiative, suggesting it is part of Beijing's plan to widen its influence in Eurasia and challenge Washington's global leadership. A few US scholars have even labeled it the Marshall Plan of China and have adopted await-and-see approach, while others oppose it simply because it was proposed by China. By doing so, they are only preventing US enterprises from benefiting from the initiative.
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled for May 14-15, will provide a platform for the participants to share their views about the future development of the initiative. In other words, although launched by China, the initiative can bring great benefits for all the participating countries. And it can help Washington and Beijing to work together in fields such as infrastructure construction in the US, and take measures to boost free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Besides, the initiative can also help deepen Sino-US cooperation and promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.

A constructive alternative to the gathering dark clouds
Four years after its formal launch in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative continues to quietly generate momentum as one of the most important geostrategic developments of the new millennium.
Over the past 40 years, China has developed the greatest concentration of industrial and manufacturing capability, raising the overall standard of living of its people while also helping boost neighboring economies, which are among the greatest achievements of the human race.
Owing to its investments and still rapidly growing market for energy, food staples and raw materials, China has become the greatest economic engine powering the major economies of Africa as well.
But why is the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing so important for China? Does it mean China will further promote globalization and regional cooperation? And how should China try to seek more chances of cooperation with other countries?
The Belt and Road Initiative is vital to promoting peace and stability in two crucial regions of the world-Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Central Asia's most visionary leaders, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, President Almazbek Atambayev of Kyrgyzstan and President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan have grasped the enormous value of transforming the region, long neglected as peripheral, into a central artery of world communication and commerce, because it will bring great benefits to their peoples.
The initiative offers the prospect of fulfilling through peace, rising living standards and improved international cooperation and understanding, the goal of making the heartland of the "world island"-the combined continents of Asia, Europe and Africa-the communications heartland, or nerve center, of the world.
That is why the forum in Beijing is so important. It offers the peoples of the "world island" a constructive alternative to the sinister gathering clouds of religious fanaticism, usually generated by poverty, fear and chaos, or the advance of menacing military alliances to threaten the national sovereignty of great nations.

Helping to fulfill the dream of shared destiny
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, as a "flagship project", is one of most crucial parts of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has both economic and geopolitical goals. The impact of the Belt and Road Initiative can be gauged from the fact that, once completed, it will include more than 60 countries, more than half of global GDP, three-quarters of global energy reserves and more than 65 percent of the world population.
Due to its very substantial geographical location, the CPEC will serve as a primary facilitator in achieving the goal of global connectedness. On a regional level, it will gradually act as the center of economic activities, with plans turning into progress. It will not only benefit Pakistan's economy by creating more than 700,000 jobs in the country and adding 2 to 2.5 percent to its GDP; its larger impact will be evident for regional neighbors as well. There is good potential to link the CPEC with regional countries. The current focus is on its expansion toward the West: Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia. Its expansion toward the East may take some time, as India has occasionally expressed reservations about it, mainly on technical grounds. Yet as things are progressing, the chances that the CPEC could play a catalyst role in even bringing the two countries closer are very much there.
Russia has vital interests in this region as well, as an active partner of both China and Pakistan. The Karachi-Lahore gas pipeline, worth $1.7 billion, has been pledged by Russia. And Russia, China and Pakistan have decided to work together to restore peace in Afghanistan.
Realizing the importance of the CPEC for Central Asia and Russia, their leaderships have shown greater interest in developing more cordial and cooperative economic and geostrategic relations with Pakistan in areas such as trade, energy sharing and tourism. Keeping in view China's economic and geostrategic interest in Central Asia and Russia, it is a vital development. The increased economic cooperation between Pakistan and Central Asia and Russia will also strengthen Pakistan's role in regional organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
Iran, too, has been playing a very significant role in regional cooperation through the CPEC, and it is significant that the Chabahar and Gwadar ports, once portrayed as competitors, have now been declared sister ports. Given the changing scenarios, the Iranian leadership hinted that China, Pakistan, Iran and Russia should cooperate more for regional stability. And China-Russia-Iran-Pakistan cooperation is being discussed in this context.
Given these scenarios of regional connectivity, there is a definite chance the CPEC will sow the seeds of more comprehensive regional connectivity and fulfill the dream of shared destiny.
BEIJING -- For centuries, the ancient Silk Road had played a significant role in commercial and cultural exchange among the countries plying its route.
Today, entrepreneurs are devoting themselves to rejuvenating the historical route and building a new world.
STRONGER TRADE LINKS
More than a thousand years ago, Emperor Xuanzong of China's Tang Dynasty (618 AD-907 AD) sent special envoys and fast horses to southern China thousands of miles away from the capital to get freshly picked lychees for his favorite concubine, killing many horses and envoys during the exhausting long trip.
Now even for fresh fruits tens of thousands miles away, say fresh cherries from Chile in South America, they can easily "fly" into Chinese supermarkets for ordinary people to enjoy thanks to the current convenient and fast trade routes.
China has now become the largest export destination for Chilean cherries. Data from the Chilean Fresh Fruit Exporters Association shows that during the last cherry export season, over 80 percent of the country's cherries were exported to China.
Chilean cherry planters and traders have made huge endeavors to ensure the fresh, crisp texture of cherries for Chinese customers. For example, newly picked cherries are transported to China by "private planes" to ensure good quality.
"I hope direct flights between China and Chile will be opened in the near future, so that Chile's cherries could arrive in China sooner and at a lower cost," said Ricardo Vial, trade manager of the Rucaray Corporation, a large-scale Chilean cherry manufacturer.
Poland is the world's third largest apple producing country. In 2014, the Russian government imposed a ban on food imports from the European Union and the United States in retaliation for their sanctions against Moscow over the Ukraine crisis, forcing Poland's apple exports to plunge.
"We launched a three-year apple promotion project focused on the Chinese market, bringing new hope for fruit farmers," said Miroslaw Maliszewski, principal of Polish Fruit Growers Association.
BOOMING INVESTMENTS AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION
In December 1992, China's Shougang Group bid for 98.4 percent of Peruvian Iron Ore Corporation's stocks and the right to tap, explore and run the mineral resources of its mineral field.
Shougang headquarters founded Shougang Hierro Peru S.A.A., a mining company, which extracts, processes and sells iron ore in Peru.
The company's entrepreneurial path in the South American country with a different language and environment from China has been bumpy with obstacles, both big or small.
"During the past 24 years, Shougang Group has invested nearly 1.5 billion US dollars in equipment replacement, technology transformation, environmental governance, living quarters and project expansion. Its output has surged from less than 3 million tons in 1992 to 11.12 million tons in 2015," said Kong Aimin, general manager of Shougang Hierro Peru S.A.A.
In addition to founding new companies abroad, a large number of Chinese corporations have deepened their cooperation with local companies overseas.
Zhejiang RIFA Digital Precision Machinery Company is a manufacturer of high-end precision machine tools with annual sales exceeding a billion yuan (about $145 million).
In 2014 and 2015, it bought out Italian corporations MCM and Colgar, which were suffering from an economic crisis in Italy.
The two Italian companies are world-leading machine tool manufacturers, whose customers include renowned airplane manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing and industrial giants General Electrics and Siemens.
"Improving technology, boosting development and expanding markets are not only play an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative, but they also meet the needs of both Chinese and Italian corporations," said Wang Benshan, chairman of Zhejiang RIFA Digital Precision Machinery Company.
"MCM and Colgar boast high-quality products and good word of mouth. Chinese companies help Italian ones out of difficulties with the market and funds, and increased taxes and stimulated employment for our city. This is win-win cooperation," said Maria Catrina Wono, deputy mayor of Cornaredo, where Calgar is based.
SMOOTHER PASSAGEWAY LINKING CHINA AND WEST
Kazakhstan is an important hub on the ancient Silk Road. The city of Khorgas is located in China, in Kazakhstan and on the border of the two countries. It serves as China's youngest border port city, a special economic zone forged by Kazakhstan, and the first cross-border trade area between China and its neighboring countries.
In December 2014, the Khorgos-Eastern Gate special economic zone in Kazakhstan, the most significant logistics center, was officially put into use.
Some foreign enterprises have gradually settled down in the special zone. With a soaring population and schools, hospitals, kindergartens and other supporting public facilities having been built, a brand new town is appearing. Many young Kazakh people have come to the special zone, some even giving up their jobs in big cities, because they think highly of the development potential and vitality here, said Zaslan, investment director of the special economic zone.
"The China-Kazakstan Horgos Frontier International Cooperation Center is the busiest among the three Horgoses," said transport driver Juura.
Spanning Chinese and Kazakh territory, the center is 5.28 square km in size. With special access linking the two countries, a constant stream of Chinese and Kazakh customers come here to buy Chinese commodities.
"My customers are merchants from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus and many other countries," said Zhang Wei, who sells bed linen at the center's Yiwu International Shopping Mall.
The Horgos city in China has become an important nod opening up to the West. Central Asia freight trains and China-Europe trains have linked up Horgos with the outside world.
Once the highway in Kazakhstan linking western China and western Europe is complete, travel time will be reduced from 40 days by sea to 10 days by land.
Chinese oil giant among 29 firms to bid for tenders as a nation recovers from international sanctions
China National Petroleum Corp, one of the country's oil giants, has been invited to bid for Iran's crude and natural gas development projects as the Persian Gulf state seeks investment in energy.
CNPC, together with 28 other oil companies including Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PJSC Gazprom, is among the international companies that have qualified to bid for tenders, according to Iran's oil ministry
If CNPC wins, the deal would be in the interests of both countries, reviving Iran's energy industry which has been hard hit by international sanctions while satisfying China, the world's second-largest economy, which has a strong demand for energy.
Iran is trying to fast-track projects to boost oil and gas production amid low prices and wants to sign agreements as soon as possible.
However, Alastair Syme, an oil analyst at Citigroup Inc in London, warns companies to be wary of investing too quickly or too much in Iran.
According to a senior engineer with CNPC, despite years of sanctions leading to a hammered economy and infrastructure, Iran, with the world's biggest natural gas reserves-estimated by BP Plc at 34 trillion cubic meters- still has significant strategic importance, with its substantial reserves of oil and gas.
Strategically located in the Middle East and sharing land borders with 15 nations, Iran also plays a crucial role in the Belt and Road Initiative as an energy hub, he says.
According to CNPC, the company has been present in Iran since 2004 and is engaged in oil and gas operations and oilfield services.
In 2009, the company signed contracts with National Iranian Oil Co to develop the North Azadegan Oilfield and Phase 11 of the South Pars gas field, which began trial production in 2015.
Iran exported 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day to China in 2015, and the country recently signed a $4.8 billion (4.6 billion euros; 3.9 billion) natural gas development project with CNPC and Total.
Iran aims to attract more than $100 billion in foreign investment to boost the country's energy sector. The country has doubled its exports as crude prices rallied.
Iran boosted oil output in 2016 by 870,000 barrels per day to 3.67 million bpd by November, and has reached several preliminary agreements with international companies, despite no concrete deals having been signed yet, Bloomberg says.
The country has set a target for daily output of 5.7 million bpd of crude and condensate early in the next decade, according to Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh.

With the theme of "People Aspire to Lasting Peace and Sustainable Development", the Commemoration is jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, The United Nations System in China and The People's Government of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
Eda Satsuki, Japan's Former President of the House of Councillors, told China Daily the United Nations decided on the goal of sustainable development, saying focusing on the people themselves is of great importance in the world.
He said there were many ways to deepen the friendship and trust between people from different countries, but that little progress and effort was being made. He wished international society would continue to improve in this area.
The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. In 2001, it adopted a resolution which decided to set September 21 as the International Day of Peace. Since then, the UN puts forward the theme of the International Day of Peace every year, holding a commemoration and calling on all countries to host various commemorative activities.
Eda Satsuki said it was with regret that Japan had placed less importance on the work of international peace, despite the annual day running for 35 years. Japan has been focusing on bilateral relations in recent years, thus causing conflicts of interest.
He said although there were some conflicts of interest in Sino-Japanese diplomacy, mutual assistance and friendliness between citizens had been continuous.
Eda Satsuki spoke highly of China's recent economic and social development.




 
Chinese companies have secured a 12 percent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's onshore oil concession, hoping to further participate in the development of United Arab Emirates' energy sector.
China National Petroleum Corp signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi oil company on Feb 19 for an 8 percent stake, paying 6.5 billion dirhams ($1.77 billion; 1.67 billion euros; 1.42 billion), followed by Shanghai-based CEFC China Energy Co, which obtained a 4 percent stake.
CNPC and CEFC are the venture's new Asian partners, joining Japanese and South Korean companies alongside BP Plc and Total SA. BP signed on to the project in December, and Total in January 2015.
The onshore concession is operated by the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations.
Asian companies are newcomers in the region, while European and US counterparts have pumped oil in the Middle East for more than a century.
"If you're Abu Dhabi and looking for demand growth, China is the future, and its demand is going to continue to grow," Chris Gunson, a Dubai-based lawyer at Amereller Legal Consultants, was quoted as saying by DealStreetAsia, a Singapore-based news and intelligence platform.
"For the big buyers in Asia, the logical source of that future supply is the Gulf," he says.
CEFC has also made a crude oil supply agreement with ADNOC, providing more than 13.2 million metric tons of high-quality crude annually to the Chinese market.
Ye Jianming, chairman of CEFC, says the deal enables the private company to secure long-term and stable onshore oil rights and interests for the company to engage in the exploration of upstream oil and gas in Abu Dhabi.
"This agreement enhances our ability to integrate ADNOC's onshore oil reserves with our storage facilities in China and Southeast Asia," Ye says.
Zhou Dadi, a senior researcher at the China Energy Research Society, says the deal will help unlock growth opportunities for both sides, helping Abu Dhabi and CEFC to further explore upstream exploration and ensure oil reserves.
He says the deal will help CEFC boost its oil supply capacity while helping China to get more involved in determining the global oil price.
CEFC China is among the 10 largest private companies in China and has a focus on energy and financial services.

China is increasing its presence in the Arctic region's energy industry.
The country's largest energy group, China National Petroleum Corp, is the latest mainland company to venture into the region.
It is participating in the Yamal liquefied natural gas or LNG project, one of the most complex of its kind.
CNPC said it is willing to participate in more such collaborative ventures to explore Arctic oil and gas assets, to further beef up its gas reserves.
Until recently, there has been no large-scale exploration by Chinese firms in the frozen land due to Arctic countries' protectionist policy.
But analysts said Chinese energy giants' efforts in recent years to increase their presence in the Arctic have been a success, and have strategic importance.
The current projects play a strategic role, said Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a consulting company that provides analysis of China's energy market.
Many countries are interested in the massive oil and gas reserves in the far north. However, only few industry giants, such as CNPC, China National Offshore Oil Corp and China Petrochemical Corp, are qualified for the difficult and expensive game of energy exploration, she said.
In 2013, China was accorded "observer" status in the Arctic Council. That symbolized an unspoken acceptance of Beijing's presence in the region. Since then, China's visibility has increased.
CNOOC was the first Chinese oil company to enter the Arctic by partnering Icelandic company Eykon Energy.
Before CNPC secured a 20 percent stake in the Yamal LNG project from Novatek in 2014, Sinopec Group, Asia's top refiner, had evinced interest in the region.
Sinopec also held preliminary talks with Iceland over oil exploration off the northeast coast of the Nordic country. It recently signed a cooperation agreement with the Icelandic government for research and development of geothermal studies.
According to Li, as US and European energy giants dominate the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic has become a precious land for Chinese companies.
Despite technical challenges and the arduous Arctic weather, participation in the polar region gives China a foothold in the resource-rich area. This could help beef up exploration and production, she said.
Despite the recent strengthening of relations between China and Russia, Li forecast no rapid expansion in the short term.

The traditional Chinese lunar calendar divides the year into 24 solar terms. Start of Summer (Chinese: 立夏), the 7th term of the year, begins on May 5 and ends on May 20 this year.
Start of Summer signals the transition of seasons. On this day, the sun's rays reach an angle of 45 degrees to the earth. The temperature will rise quickly during this period, yet in northern China weather remains mild, not tropical.
Here are five things to learn about the Start of Summer.
The villagers he led only had hand tools－and explosives. He's the stuff of legend－but real. Huang Dafa is arguably an actual, modern incarnation of the ancient myth of Yu Gong.
The saying yu gong yi shan－or "the old man moves mountains"－is a parable of persistence that seems foolhardy in the face of unimaginable odds.
Fable says two peaks separated Yu Gong's home from the village.
So, he decided to dig them away.
Another elderly man mocked him. Yu Gong responded that while his descendants could dig for generations, the mountains wouldn't grow any higher.
The gods were so moved by his determination that they moved the mountains for him.
Huang enjoyed no such divine intervention.
He had to rely on pure will.

Beijing's Parkview Green complex is awarded for its energy-saving environment. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Malls used to be all about shopping, but as air quality becomes one of the top concerns globally, some of them have set out to make themselves urban retreats.
Beijing's Parkview Green, a complex that includes offices, a shopping mall, an art center and a hotel, was recently awarded the LEED Dynamic Plaque by the US Green Building Council, a nonprofit organization based in Washington which promotes sustainability in buildings.
This follows the LEED Platinum certification it earned in 2009.
Parkview Green is the first building in the Asia-Pacific region to win the plaque.
LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is a rating system developed by USGBC that encourages green practices in the real estate industry by measuring energy efficiency, water conservation, waste and recycling, transportation and user experience. It is used in more than 160 countries.
The LEED Dynamic Plaque, which was launched recently, emphasizes a building's performance like real-time monitoring for environmental protection and energy conservation, and user experience.
With its glass exterior and steel frame structures, Parkview Green's energy consumption is 50 percent lower than industry standards. It also has a rain collection system that filters rain water for irrigation, and an air filtration system that keeps the PM2.5 under 60 at all times.
Oliver Lai, Parkview Green's general manager, says that environmental protection is not about design, but is in day-to-day operations. "This is not just an award. It is a lifetime motivator for us to be part of the green movement," he says.
While this type of building requires more investment in the early stages, the cost will balance out in a few decades with the energy saved, he adds.
Parkview Green will display real-time energy conservation data in the building.
Sarah Alexander, the vice-president of USGBC, says that China is now the second country after the United States in LEED usage, with more than 3,300 projects, which cover more than 161 million square meters.
"Market transformation happens one project at a time, and China has an opportunity to drive sustainability on a global scale."
In the next five years, she says she hopes China will aspire to getting thousands of buildings certified and set a goal of 1 billion square meters of certified space.
Feng Yi, vice-chairman of the Beijing Construction Association, says he hopes the construction industry in China follows the Parkview Green example and becomes part of the green building movement.
WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging app, is being used for an ever longer period of time and is growing into a lifestyle choice embedded into daily activities and interactions, a new survey has found.
In 2016, one-third of WeChat's 889 million monthly active users spent a solid four hours or more per day on the mobile chatting tool, twice that of a year ago, according to Penguin Intelligence, a research arm of WeChat's developer Tencent Holdings.
The average daily time spent is also up slightly, now at 66 minutes, surpassing that of Facebook's average 50 minutes recorded last year.
And it's becoming more pervasive and stickier than ever, creeping into new aspects of life from offline payments to receiving newsfeeds.
A striking 92 percent of respondents to the survey said they prefer mobile payment over cash and credit cards when shopping in stores. Speed, convenience and "not bothering to carry cash" are the top three reasons cited for using mobile wallets to buy movie tickets and pay utility bills.
It's also transforming the way people get information. WeChat's public accounts, which allow media services, industry bloggers and corporate branding campaigners, to feed content to subscribers, are quickly gaining traction. Nearly 60 percent of users expressed the willingness to tip good content producers.
Already cementing WeChat's position as the nation's most-used app, users found a majority of newly added contacts are casual acquaintances, notably in work-related communication. About 45 percent of WeChat users reported to have over 200 contacts, up from just 10 percent a few years ago.
Such a trend is turning the app into a virtual workplace. Over 80 percent of people have handled office work on WeChat, from transferring files and coordinating tasks to taking video calls and making transactions.
"The all-in-one super app is radically changing the way I live. When lining up for coffee, I can't see a single customer holding a wallet - instead they hold mobile phones over a reader and the lattes are theirs," said Fred Wellington, an Australian auditor working in Shanghai.
Last year, WeChat users helped drive 174.3 billion yuan ($25.3 billion) of information-sector spending and created jobs for 18.8 million people, according to a separate study by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology released in early April.
Mobile apps are gaining additional steam by integrating payment functions into public service platforms, said Lu Wei, secretary-general of the Internet Society of China. With a few taps on the phone, users can declare personal taxes, pay traffic fines and make medical appointments, he said.
The internet-enabled digital economy had claimed 30.6 percent of China's GDP by 2016, according to the China Internet Plus and Digital Economy Index published this month.

BEIJING -- A total of 62.4 percent of Chinese adults read via the popular messaging app WeChat in 2016, up 10.5 percentage points year on year, according to a survey released on Tuesday.
About 68.2 percent of adults read digitally in 2016, up 4.2 percentage points than 2015, while 58.8 percent read paper books, only a 0.4 percentage-point increase, according to an annual poll on reading habits, which was carried out in 52 cities across the country.
The survey, conducted by the Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, revealed that 66.1 percent of respondents read on their mobile phones in 2016, up 6.1 percentage points than the previous year.
The average spending of reading on mobile phones was 16.95 yuan ($2.46) per capita in 2016, 5.76 yuan more than the previous year, the survey showed.
A total of 25.2 percent of respondents would accept paid reading on mobile phones, while the rest would only read free of charge.
On average, Chinese read 7.86 books per capita in 2016, including 3.21 e-books, the survey showed.
BRUSSELS -- The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to be held from May 14 to 15 in Beijing, could be a dream venue for discussing digital silk road featuring 5G communications, a European digital expert told Xinhua.
"The Belt and Road Forum is the most important event of the year which will bring about a new dynamic of cooperation. It seems the dreamed venue to discuss digital silk road and a common roadmap for 5G," said Luigi Gambardella, president of ChinaEU, a business-led international association in Brussels that promotes digital cooperation.
Gambardella said he was invited to the forum and he believes the Belt and Road Initiative could promote global peace and stability by fostering economic growth and integration of participating countries.
"It contrasts with the current economic stagnation in Europe and other regions of the world," he added. [ As a digital expert, Gambardella suggested that the discussion of the forum not be limited to railway or other types of physical connection. Building a digital silk road and 5G deployment should be prioritized too.
Speaking highly of the new technology, he defined 5G as a faster wireless broadband with a speed at least 1,000 times compared to 4G network and it enables the connection of all possible electronic devices and makes new services like driverless cars possible.
"5G constitutes a technical revolution which will change people's life greatly. I hope those countries cooperate to design and implement smart 5G cities across the Silk Road," Gambardella said.
He called for the establishment of a high-level group of experts for technical support to governments which seek to deploy 5G projects.
"Local governments deserve not only the best 5G infrastructures but a global ecosystem at service level," he said.
A miner carves out blocks of salt from the Danakil Depression in Afar, Ethiopia. Technology and the opening of the area to investment and tourism are threatening the traditional way of life.Zacharias Abubeker / Afp
LAKE ASALE, Ethiopia - Every morning, hundreds of men converge on a dry lake bed in a remote corner of Ethiopia, where they cleave the ground open with handaxes to extract salt, just as their fathers and grandfathers once did.
They toil under the gaze of a caravan of camels who will carry their salt bricks to market, in a trek that historians estimate has gone on since the 6th century.
But with the Ethiopian government opening the isolated northern region to investors and tourists by cutting new roads through surrounding mountains, the laborers, traders and caravan drivers that make up the industry say their traditional way of life could soon be lost.
"If it continues like this, it will stop our work," miner Musa Idris said as he stood on the cracked earth that fringes Lake Asale, where the miners work amid temperatures that can reach 50 C, making it one of the world's hottest places.
Salt mining was once so vital to the economy of the depression that the seven-kilogramme chunks of salt Idris and his colleagues hack from the ground were used as currency.
While the trade is still important, it is no longer the only game in town.
Restaurants and hotels have sprung up in the area, also known as the Danakil depression, to cater to tourists who come from across the globe to visit the uniquely desolate landscape formed by the intersection of three tectonic plates.
The region has also attracted foreign firms that want to mine potash and send it to Asia.
The presence of salt in the area has not escaped the attention of mining companies.
A handful of kilometers away from where Idris and his colleagues gather, an Ethiopian company has built a plant that sucks water from the lake into evaporation ponds, creating salt the miners say is of a better quality but costs more than the square blocks they mine from the lake bed.
"The traditional way is quite different from ours. That one takes more toil and time," evaporation plant manager Maheri Asgedew said of the manual way of mining.
Perhaps no development has impacted the traditional salt industry like the new roads.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country and one of the continent's best-performing economies, with growth reaching nearly 10 percent in 2015.
The government has made projects such as dams and road-building a priority as part of its strategy to end the poverty that afflicts around one in three of its citizens.
Getting the salt-laden camels from Lake Asale to the nearest city Mekele used to be a four-day trek down rock-strewn gullies.
Now, the caravans terminate in Berhale, the region's main salt trading outpost which road builders connected to Mekele by tarmac about five years ago.
The journey takes only three days, an improvement that some of the camel drivers and labourers who help offload the salt bricks have welcomed, but which others worry is a sign that technology will soon put them all out of business.
"We have no water and sometimes we eat bad food," said Musa, whose daily pay of 500 birr ($22) affords him a house in Hamed Ela, a ramshackle settlement of huts near the salt fields.
"If technology comes and changes it, it would be better."
But others embrace the traditional way. For them, it's simply the family business.
"We see this as our farmland, so we don't have anything else but this," miner Indris Ibrahim said. "My children and grandchildren will hopefully mine in this area."
TOKYO - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said that the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) attracting members from Asia and beyond is a positive for infrastructure development in Asia.
Kuroda, former Asian Development Bank chief, said in a speech recently that in terms of infrastructure development in Asia, there was room for more than just the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
"It's simply not possible for the ADB and the World Bank to fill the gap completely in infrastructure development in Asia," The BOJ chief said during a question and answer session after a speech he made in Yokohama on Tuesday.
He also noted that healthy competition among various players is a positive for infrastructure development and economic growth.
Kuroda was speaking at a gathering of think tanks organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Institute ahead of the 50th annual meeting of the ADB later this week.
The ADB currently comprises 67 member states and regions and has for a long time assisted developing countries with advancement projects by way of loans.
The AIIB's members, however, while not including Japan or the United States, have already stood at 70, with the bank poised to make significant inroads into regional infrastructural development projects.
During his speech, the BOJ chief called on policy makers to ensure that households and businesses have access to financial services, stating that this is key to poverty reduction in Asia.
He also said that removing existing barriers that are currently preventing financial inclusiveness is of paramount importance to reducing poverty.
Kuroda added that information and communication technology will continue to play a large part in the development of Asia by way of helping financial inclusion mechanisms to expand.
The former ADB chief said that economic growth in Asia specifically over the last 50 years has been key to driving down poverty.
TOKYO - By day, Sumiko Iwamuro runs a Chinese restaurant, where she has worked for six decades making "gyoza" dumplings, while by night, she spins records at Tokyo clubs under the moniker DJ Sumirock.
But the juggling of long days and frenzied nights is not the most inspiring thing about Iwamuro.
She is also 82 years old.
Japan is known for its ageing demographic, with people aged 65 and above making up 26.6 percent of the population in 2015.
A prime example of an active senior, Iwamuro plays to crowds mostly 60 years younger than she is at the DecaBarZ nightclub in the heart of Tokyo's Shinjuku district.
Taking up the turntables in her 70s, Iwamuro then spent a year learning the tricks of the trade at a school for disc jockeys.
Once on the dance floor, she stole the hearts of club-goers.
"She's got this energy that goes beyond age, and that can equal any young person's here," said 25-year-old clubber Fuminari Fujii.
Iwamuro says her sound is fundamentally techno music with jazz, French chanson and classical music mixed in.
Ever curious and never one to give up her dreams, she hopes one day to debut on the New York club scene.
"When I spin the tables, I just want to match the beat, choose the right music", she said, when asked what kept her practising her tunes and returning to spin records.
"But the best thing is for my audience to enjoy themselves."

Editor's note:
While folk music is no longer mainstream in China, some popular TV talent shows have recently brought it back into the spotlight. And if you like poems or want to enjoy a cup of coffee in a quiet bar, folk music from a group of young Chinese singers makes a nice accompaniment. With its poetic or funny lyrics, slow tempo and melodies, the music is the young generation's way of understanding love and fights in their lives.
Here we choose seven popular young folk singers and their masterpieces in recent years.

Chinese pop singer Coco Lee announced on Feb 14 her "18" concert tour plan for 2017.
By naming her upcoming concert tour "18", the American-Chinese singer hopes to bring back the "courage, passion and curiosity of an 18-year-old," she said at the official kickoff of the tour in Shanghai.
Lee started her career in 1992 winning a new talent singing award in Hong Kong, and soon gained national fame with her sultry style and vigorous performances.
Last year's TV appearance won her a younger and newer fan group among Chinese audiences, and her trusted promoter, Timeless Treasure, convinced her that "if you put on a concert, many people will be coming".
The first leg of her "18" concert will take place at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center on May 6, before going on to Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an in Shaanxi province, Chengdu in Sichuan province, Hong Kong and Taipei, as well as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto.
Ofo bikes along Beijing's East Third Ring Road. CHEN XIAOGEN / FOR CHINA DAILY
Fight by startups to be unicorn of emerging sector proving costly
Painting their bikes in highly conspicuous hues of yellow, orange or blue, China's 30-odd bike-sharing startups sport a parade of colorful branding and are striving to return the nation to its place of honor as the "kingdom of bicycles".
While bike-sharing is no rarity elsewhere in the world, the Chinese version gives wheels to the concept, with customers able to find a free bike anywhere in the city closest to you (located via GPS on an app) and leave them when they are finished in their journeys.
The concept is all the rage among students and young professionals across the nation for being convenient, green and cheap. An average 30-minute ride costs 0.5 yuan (7 cents).
But the fight to become the unicorn of the burgeoning sector has proven to be a rather costly one.
In the latest development, ofo, a leading player featuring iconic yellow bike offerings, was officially added to the line-up of Didi Chuxing, the nation's dominant riding hailing app.
Didi, which drove rival Uber out of the country after years of cash burning, has folded ofo's bike-sharing functions into its "hugely popular app with 400 million users", according to a company statement.
When Didi users want to revert to bicycles as a means of transportation, ofo's service is displayed as an option on Didi's platform, which is already laden with everything from buses and taxis to chauffeur services.
Aside from app integration, Didi said it will tap into ofo's data allowing it to design "more efficient bike-bus transfer options" on its shuttle bus service.
"Didi will involve ofo into its own algorithmic model via artificial intelligence techniques and provide real-time travel options to users," said Neil Wang, China president at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
This marks a direct counter-punch to ofo's chief competitor Mobike, which in early April got linked into WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging-to-payment app owned by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, taking the bike-sharing craze to new heights.
The tie-up allows Mobike to be at the immediate disposal of 889 million WeChat users starting a video chat, to browse news and conduct payment via the app. A Mobike icon is placed on the top of an array of e-wallet offerings, which also include Didi's services and ticket booking.
Ofo and Mobike, which are rekindling Chinese people's interest in a traditionally preferred mode of transport, are the latest darling of the capital market.
Following $450 million in Series D funding by a consortium including Didi, the cash-rich smart bike company announced a week earlier fresh strategic investment from Ant Financial Services Group, the nation's top e-payment provider.
Meanwhile, Mobike has attracted more than $300 million in investment so far this year from a list of prominent names including Temasek, Hillhouse Capital, and Tencent.
The landscape is getting red-hot as players compete to be the number one choice for bike riders. By working with Sesame Credit, a credit-rating system developed by Ant Financial, ofo waived a 99 yuan deposit fee for users in Shanghai whose Sesame Credit reached 650.
To fend off competition, rival Mobike is giving deep subsidies through random cash incentives to retain users.
Compared with the enormous input companies need to purchase huge fleets of bikes and make them accessible for rent through an app, the seemingly utopian model has already been subject to skepticism over its ability to turn a profit.
The business model followed by so many bicycle-sharing companies just doesn't appear (yet) to have any competitive advantage, according to Jeffrey Towson, a management professor at Peking University and a private equity investor.
"It doesn't create a superior service like taxi ride-sharing (more drivers means shorter waiting times). It doesn't create a much lower cost structure per unit," he said.
As bikes get fancier and more expensive, it would still take about a year to recoup the production expenses of a bike, not to mention maintenance, theft and vandalism, he added.
"While the market may well consolidate, there is no reason yet to think the business itself will generate any type of exceptional profitability," he said.
But the sector still encourages investors to plow in money and resources because of the huge traffic such apps bring in, said Lu Zhenwang, chief executive officer of Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy.
"The area is destined to be a fierce battlefield for internet giants as they strengthen online-to-offline deployment and race to become the prioritized cashless payment tool," he said.
Wang from Frost agreed, saying that the most direct support from Didi is the huge customer base and traffic it owns, which will stimulate the explosion of users as well as daily orders for ofo.
"The WeChat-Mobike linkup has proved that such strategic cooperation does boost the number of active users significantly. In the future, this is not simple investment in money, but in resource sharing in the long run," he said.
Shared bikes park at a recommended site in Shijingshan District of Beijing, March 17, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]
Last weekend, I was hanging out downtown with a friend and my sister. We were walking through a public spare when all of a sudden a heated argument between a student and a middle-aged woman arrested our attention.
Out of curiosity, we all stopped to look and found that they were arguing over an Ofo bike which has recently become quite popular in this city, along with two other bike-sharing companies including Mo-bike.
From what we observed, it seemed that the student saw two unoccupied bikes on the square and decided to peddle one away. But the woman claimed that she was asked to guard the two bikes for her friends who had gone to the toilet. So the woman held the bike handle-bar and refused to let it go. She told the girl loudly that she had to call her friends first to check with them before agreeing to let go of the bike.
The student found this absurd and lashed out the woman by saying that. "What is wrong with you? This is not a bike personally owned by you. This is supposed to be public facilities. You have absolutely no right to keep it." After hearing this, the woman shouted that she was going to slap the girl if she talked to her like that ever again. The atmosphere got increasingly tense. Both parties seemed to be determined to win the argument. The student then apologized to the woman in a not so friendly tone and started trying to talk some sense into her and convinced her to let go of the bike.
As all this was happening, nobody seemed to want to intervene during the heat of the moment. In fact, there was a vacant bike lying a few meters away from them. We walked away before witnessing the end of the tussle.
While walking, we were discussing who was to blame. I personally understood why the girl was so angry, even though I might not agree with her taking out her anger on the woman in a public place which was only going to make her less willing to budge. My friend and sister seemed to believe the girl should give up arguing with her and simply use the third bike lying around. They reckoned sometimes we simply can't win no matter how reasonable we may sound.
Bike-sharing services can serve people very well, considering that the underground system in this city is still under construction, which has to block many roads and worsen the already terrible traffic. So, these bikes are welcome to the public considering that it can be very cheap. Furthermore, people are doing exercising while peddling and can make some contribution to environmental protection. This is more like shooting a few birds with one stone.
But the new bike-sharing fever is accompanied with problems. For a whole week, I kept seeing a Mo-bike at the front door of my neighbor's flat where it's not supposed to be parked. It was there every morning when I headed to my workplace and it was still there every night when I came back home. Of course, it may not be the same one.
Also, I have heard, more than once, from friends claiming that they would like to bike lock up the bike or take it home. Apparently, some people still haven't fully realized that it's illegal to do that.
Of course, the government has realized this and some people have been warned or even suspended from their jobs for violating the rules of using these bikes. As this is still pretty new, both the public and the companies owning these bikes need time to adjust. But hopefully, more people in the near future will stop treating the public facilities like private possessions.
Aside from this problem, I really hope the government can make the roads in cities more bike-friendly. From my personal perspective, it's pretty risky to ride a bike in Chinese cities. Things are probably much better in some metropolises, but here in Changsha, I don't really see separated bike lanes. Even though some lanes are labeled as bike lanes, they are most of the time unfortunately occupied by private vehicles or motorcycles. Having to watch out for traffic from all directions seems to be pretty common in this city. I have become accustomed to being very cautious when walking across a road. Even though there are traffic lights everywhere, it's not safe.
It would be really nice to see China become a kingdom of bikes again. This will undoubtedly help address the urgent air pollution and meanwhile help improve public health. But still a lot more measures should be taken by both the government and the public before the desirable goals are achieved.

After an on-and-off month-long race to win over customers with free rides, Chinese bike-sharing pioneers ofo and Mobike have entered a new round of competition, with both companies offering users random cash rewards of up to 5,000 yuan per ride.
Following Mobike's cash-reward plan, launched in late March, ofo announced on April 16 that it would offer its own rewards. Both companies are offering random gifts ranging from one to thousands of yuan per ride, provided the ride lasts more than 10 minutes and covers a distance of at least 500 meters. In particular, ofo offers a maximum of 5,000 yuan for reward.
Mobike users hoping to cash in need to find and unlock bikes marked with hongbao, or red, cash-filled envelopes. Ofo users, meanwhile, can ride any bike within particular regions tagged as offering hongbao. Ofo also noted that higher rewards are more likely to be given to users who park their bikes in city-designated areas. As for Mobike, the company's cash rewards aim to encourage all users to increase the efficiency of shared bike use.
Shared bikes are becoming increasingly popular in China, especially among white-collar workers during rush hour. Hence, bikes are often in high demand near bus or subway stations. While the rewards aim to strategically guide the distribution of bikes, it remains difficult to produce bike flow from offices to transportation hubs in order to guarantee bike supply.
Nevertheless, both companies appear to be thriving. Mobike announced on April 13 - less than one month after its reward policy was made public - that it set a record of 20 million bike rides on a single day. Ofo achieved its own record of 10 million rides at the end of March, media reported.
Voters in Japan are deeply divided over campaign to revise Article 9
TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday that he hopes to see a revised Constitution go into effect in 2020 under a plan that will see the first change to the postwar charter.
Speaking in a video message at a gathering to celebrate the he 70th anniversary of the Pacifist Constitution being enacted, Abe said he wanted the language in the revised Constitution to mention Japan's Self-Defense Forces.
The current charter makes no mention of the existence of the SDF in its war-renouncing pledges, which has led to a great deal of controversy regarding the constitutionality of Abe and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party camp's push to expand the scope of the nation's forces.
"By making explicit the status of the SDF in the Constitution during our generation's lifetime, we should leave no room for contending that the SDF may be unconstitutional," the prime minister said.
In an upper house election held last July, Abe's ruling coalition won a sweeping majority and along with conservative and pro-revision forces, the ruling camp command a two-thirds majority in both chambers necessary to call a national referendum on changing the constitution.
Article 9 of Japan's Pacifist Constitution states that "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes".
It goes on to state: "Land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."
Voters in Japan are deeply divided over Abe's campaign to revise the Constitution, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
The Nikkei Inc/TV Tokyo survey showed about 46 percent of respondents favored keeping the Constitution as it is, four percentage points lower than a similar poll last year.
The number favoring a change stood at 45 percent, up five percentage points from a year ago.
Protection mission
Meanwhile, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force Sazanami destroyer has joined the Izumo helicopter carrier in escorting a United States Navy vessel, sources said on Wednesday.
The Sazanami joined the mission having departed from a MSDF base in Kure on Tuesday, Kyodo News quoted government and other sources as saying.
Japan's Ministry of Defense previously said the inaugural mission, since the contentious new legislation took effect last year, is aimed at a showing of Japanese force alongside that of the US.
The Izumo, the largest warship Japan has entered into service since World War II, and widely regarded as de facto aircraft carrier, left its base in Yokosuka on Monday for the mission.


Japanese PM aims to revise Constitution before 2020

TOKYO - In a recent televised statement, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he hoped to see a revised version of the country's pacifist Constitution take effect from 2020.

It would mark the first time since the end of Word War II that Japan's pacifist charter will be changed.

Some of the prime minister's recent remarks on revisions to the Constitution were based on the idea that the current charter makes no mention of Japan's Self-Defense Forces.

But while Abe plans to forge ahead with parliamentary debate on the issue and use his ruling bloc's majority to pave the way for the legislation to be passed, a peace-loving public might prove to be a monumental stumbling block.

"The Constitution is part of our national identity and since the end of the war Japan has been a peaceful country and has consistently spread this message to the world," said Arisa Nagai, a student at Chou University's faculty of law.

"The younger generations will inherit whatever fundamental changes occur in Japan and as the country has enjoyed peace for the past seven decades, I don't see the need to change the Constitution."

The 27-year-old added that the majority of her peers and professors felt the same way and would oppose the move.

Opposition parties, civic groups, legal experts, scholars, political watchers and individuals, spanning the length and breadth of the country have resoundingly called for Article 9 of the Constitution to be upheld in recent days.

Article 9 states: "The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.

"Land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."

Those words have ensured Japan's forces maintained only a defensive posture, but a reinterpretation by the government saw the forces' operational scope widened to the point that now certain activities that are not wholly defensive in nature may be deemed unconstitutional.

"The browbeating in Parliament to force the (security) legislation into law was one thing, but fundamentally changing the nation's charter for the first time ever, would be a completely different proposition," said Koichi Ishikawa, a researcher at Tokyo's International Christian University.



My taxi pulls up at the grand door to Jiangnan University in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, under a summer sky coated in Azure blue as bright and as a baby boy's freshly-painted bedroom. Beaming golden sunshine beats down upon my brow as I make my way through the giant campus entrance, enticed on by the far-off rhythms of beating drums.
I'm here to attend the 7th Jiangnan University Food and Culture Festival, an event not to be missed by any foodie worth his salt, or with half an idea what a free lunch looks like.
Wuxi's biggest university, Jiangnan is home to nigh on 200 overseas students, hailing from such far-flung destinations as Ghana, Bangladesh, and Syria. The festival celebrates the diverse cultures which come together through the school's many exchange programs – the ingredients of which provide a succulent dish to behold.
Arriving at a snug courtyard hugged by emerald-tinged water on all sides, guests make their way across a red-carpeted gangplank draped in the multicolored flags of nations far and wide.

A smiling face with tears, or 'Tears of Joy", was chosen as the most popular emoji globally, with 21.25 percent of reaches used on social media, according to a report released by Chinese tech startup Kika.
Based on internet user behavior across the world, the report "Emoji, the Rise of New World Language" shows that "Tears of Joy" ranked No 1 as used by netizens, followed by "Heart" in second place and "Love" in third.
The report also indicated that Chinese people check their Wechat 14.5 times on average and spend 48 minutes on social media per day. "Grin" is the emoji that Chinese used the most.
"Face with Tears of Joy" became one of the most frequently used "words" in 2015 and was also the word of the year as judged by the Oxford English Dictionary.
Like text messages, different emoticons represent different meanings and emotions. They are often more intuitive and simple than words, which is also the reason they have become so popular worldwide. Therefore, more and more people choose to express their emotions and ideas by using emojis.

"Funny", a made-in-China emoji, inclusively used on Tieba, the largest Chinese communication platform provided by the search engine giant Baidu, seems to have recently moved beyond just China.
Now, it is more than an emoji, but a cultural derivation.
Reaching global markets
A series of "funny" emoji-based bolsters have attracted the attention of Japanese customers through Amazon Japan, an online shopping center.
Even if one bolster costs about 1,750 yen ($16.73), more than three times the price in China, it doesn't dampen their desires to buy it.
One Japanese customer Miki said: "They are just so cute and I bought three bolsters at one time for my family. And every time I see them, my mood just brightens suddenly."
"I think the emoji implies very complicated meanings. Different people can read different things from it. For example, my dad will send it on the occasion when he did not agree with someone but he has to say something and behave politely. But one of my friends think it is nothing but an expression of fun," said one Japanese netizen Kiro Kara.

China and the Central and Eastern European countries must begin to view each other not strictly as competitors, but as partners
President Xi Jinping's intention to renew the once significant and famous Silk Road, and to include within it the earlier announced "16+1 Cooperation", couldn't come at a better moment from the perspective of the Central and Eastern European countries.
Considering that the majority of the CEECs, being EU member states, were severely threatened by the world economic crisis that initially hit the US financial sector and then spilled over to the rest of the world, not bypassing Europe, such a maneuver was absolutely wise. At the same time, the minority of CEECs that still are not in the EU, but ardently wish to get in, were in an even worse situation based on their underprivileged overall internal conditions.
Thus, it wouldn't be a hyperbole to describe the newly emerged form of cooperation as an offer of a helping hand to a friend or friends in need.
Suddenly the prospects for the CEECs have become encouraging, though all parties involved in regional efforts like the "16+1 Cooperation" and the much wider Belt and Road Initiative must overcome prejudices toward each other and change their mindset in order to stop seeing each other strictly as competitors, but as partners.
Notably, these challenges seem to be very demanding, since they are grounded on the diversity of 16 countries, each with disadvantages derived from complex internal circumstances and the additional burden of such external occurrences as refugee crises and terrorist threats. This is why the political elites of the participating countries must be aware that success is granted only if all participants build their relations on the Belt and Road principles of joint discussion, co-construction and sharing; creating an open, inclusive, balanced and benefits-sharing framework of regional economic cooperation; practicing a new approach to sharing power and responsibility; and pursuing benefits and righteousness alike.
Following these principles will lead to realization of the key objective of the Belt and Road's "five ways of connectivity" : policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bonds.
And when it comes to the other essential part of the "16+1 Cooperation" equation - that is, China - it is necessary to abolish ideological divisions and geopolitics and push forward comprehensive and balanced development of China-EU relations by promoting further and in-depth cooperation between the two markets, two civilizations and two powers - China and Europe.
So far, driven by the coordination of "the 16+1 Cooperation" platform, official institutions and local governments of China and the CEEC have formed a series of policy coordination such as between prime ministers, ministers, departments and bureaus. The resources from all parties and policy instruments are power factors that can help form new and creative decision outcomes and support tools.
What is more, the "16+1 Cooperation" promotes active engagement of enterprises, financial institutions and people organizations; contributes to complex and multiple interest interaction among all powers; improves the shift or integration of the industry chain, financial products and collective and individual factors toward the Central and East European market; and shores up confidence of the Belt and Road in the CEEC market.
Since the "16+1 Cooperation" is a format that provides an institutional framework for the initiatives, both in programs and projects, in economy, investment and finances, as well as in the areas of research, science, education and culture, China and the CEECs by now have established at least 15 coordination mechanisms or platforms. These are in such areas as economy and trade, investment, tourism, local cooperation, transportation, logistics, technical cooperation, think tanks and health. Such kinds of coordination mechanism or platforms are an innovation in the field of policy communication. They are practical, flexible and targeted.
In trying to summarize projects that have so far been initiated or realized, one could easily get the impression that the infrastructure projects are overwhelming. Certainly the substantial infrastructure projects so far accomplished have opened the door to cooperation, but of the greatest importance, at this point, is the opening of communication between the CEECs and Chinese entrepreneurs and innovators that will lead to full utilization of the aforementioned projects. The relevance of roads, railways and bridges definitely shouldn't be argued, but success of both the "16+1 Cooperation" and the Belt and Road will be measured by the bulk of goods that have been transported, the number of people who have traveled, and the volume of financial transactions that have flowed between the countries.
The CEEC's stakeholders should bear in mind that Chinese partners are receptive to exceptional business ideas. Thus, there is a need for pushing forward domestic industrial transformation and upgrading and a necessity to overcome the role of plain consumer and take on the role of innovator and manufacturer. Such changes would naturally lead to a more open, inclusive and diversified type of cooperation that would easily assure stable finances and even welcome third parties.

China Post has recently released on its WeChat account a free set of 16 animated stickers, or biaoqing bao, each portraying a type of dinosaur found in China.
In each sticker, the cartoon dinosaur expresses various emotions, such as shock, joy and anger, or depicts a scene, such as saying goodbye.
Featured genera include the Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic, the remains of which were first found in Sichuan province in 1979, and Liaoningosaurus from the early Cretaceous period; two fossil specimens were collected in Liaoning province.
The stickers are to generate interest in a set of seven stamps, titled Dinosaurs of China, which China Post will issue on May 19.
Chinese tourists doubled spending while visiting Britain in the months after the UK's vote to leave the European Union, according to a survey by Global Blue, a tax refund firm.
The survey shows that Chinese visitors now make up 33 percent of tourists taking advantage of duty-free purchases in the United Kingdom, and that they increased their spending by 103 percent in February, due almost entirely to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. The pound has slipped 15 percent against the US dollar since June.
Chinese flight bookings to the UK in January rose 81 percent year-on-year, according to travel analysts at ForwardKeys, and for the first three months of this year, Chinese flight reservations to the UK were 43 percent up on last year.
Jo Leslie, who runs the Great Chinese Welcome Programme for the government agency Visit Britain, said:"Chinese tourists in London spend twice as long there as they do in mainland Europe, spend twice as much money, and the numbers are growing at twice the rate."
In the UK, shoppers can make duty-free purchases if they have a permanent address outside the EU. Until recently, they had to pay the duty at the time of their purchase and claim it back at the airport before leaving.
Global Blue, a tax refund specialist, recently struck an agreement with UnionPay, which provides card and transaction services for most Chinese banks. Many Chinese tourists can now pay for goods when they visit Britain and either get a transfer straight to their bank card, as long as it has a UnionPay logo, or get an immediate refund while still in country, provided they claim, with receipts, from specific payment points.
The new system completely eradicates queuing at airports and waiting for weeks for a refund payment to reach a claimant's account, according to Global Blue.
Try a locally flavored meal, get your shoes shined, mail a postcard or just grab some groceries. More and more Chinese family travelers are opting to taste the flavor of old Los Angeles at a legendary farmers market.
"They are increasingly open to explore real stories of American people," said Lexie Wei, a Los Angeles-based tourism consultant. "Chinese tourists' interest and tastes have improved. They want stories."
Wei's recent WeChat blog on the Original Farmers Market, an old farmers market in Los Angeles, has generated more than 60,000 views in just a few weeks.
An article introducing the market's history and stories behind its shops and restaurants turned out to be a hit with the Chinese audience.
"It's not just an average farmers market. It has a rich history. It is a microcosm of the American culture, and represents the vicissitudes of Los Angeles and even the history of Chinese immigration," said Wei.
Established in 1934, the open-air market has more than 100 different shops, restaurants and grocers. It evolved from a traditional farmers market, where farmers sold their vegetables and produce to local customers, to a tourist destination. Two Chinese restaurants have been there for decades.
"The market is a unique place with a lot of history and charm. It's a cultural landmark in Los Angeles," said Maritza Cerrato, marketing and tourism specialist with the Original Farmers Market.
"Ninety percent of the shops are family owned and operated. You can meet the owners, and in many shops you can see multi-generations of families working side-by-side," said Cerrato. "Local people come here and sit at the same table every day, read newspapers and talk about the news with their friends. This is a place for visitors and locals to meet."
Meeting local people and learning stories of human interest are the top reasons the farmers market is gaining popularity among Chinese travelers.
"There is a sandwich shop run by the original owner in his 90s, a toy store operated by a veteran and an Asian restaurant run by an American couple who had lived in Singapore for many years," said Wei.
The US tour operators need to dig deep and present these stories to Chinese visitors, because in the future, travelers aged 25 to 35 will make up the majority of overseas Chinese tourists and they tend to focus on the cultural experience, said Wei.
"A combination of nature, stories and urban development will mostly resonate with Chinese visitors," she said.
The Original Farmers Market started noticing the increase in Chinese visitors a year ago.

On Sunday morning, one day ahead of the launch, the two astronauts, 49-year-old Jing Haipeng and 37-year-old Chen Dong, met reporters during a news briefing at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. In addition to their space mission, the new astronaut suits they wore were also in the limelight.
The new uniforms, worn by astronauts while working on Earth, features different shades of navy blue - inspired by the color of the skyline and space, according to the the Astronaut Center of China's spacesuit laboratory. The V-shaped pattern on the chest carries an auspicious meaning of "victory" in each mission.
The suits are among the newly unveiled autumn and winter series for astronauts, using thick woolen fabric to maintain warmth. Others include outdoor training suits and winter coats.
Since May 2015, China's Astronaut Center has begun to design astronauts' attire, including on-orbit suits, on-ground suits and accessories.
I'm not normally one for early starts. But the breakfast in Yangzhou is something to wake up early for, I'm assured by my Chinese colleagues.
And so, on a brief trip to the historical city, I find myself up before the sun preparing to tuck in to something I've never tried before－zao cha.
Zao cha, or early breakfast tea, is something of an institution in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. It is an early-morning meal where delicious small treats are served with a variety of steaming hot teas.
You might say it sounds similar to any other breakfast ritual that takes place throughout the world－that's where you'd be wrong. Zao cha in Yangzhou is a traditional, cultural and overwhelmingly social event.
As the soporific effects of the night before wear off, I descend a case of winding steps which take me to a sunken quadrangle, hemmed in by ornate Qing Dynasty buildings. I am immediately struck by how many people are crammed into the space below－my interest is piqued. Over to the left a squadron of elderly men and women, probably fitter than me, perform tai chi in unison. To the right, another hefty group sit on benches chatting and listening to Yangzhou ditties. Straight ahead is what they are all here waiting for, the true purpose－Ye Chun Teahouse.
Ye Chun was first established in 1877 as a place for Yangzhou locals to enjoy good tea and good food. Over the years the restaurant has become synonymous with zao cha, with people lining up in the early hours to get a table so they can enjoy the food, the hot tea and most importantly a good chat with friends.
Luckily for me, a Chinese colleague managed to wangle us a table and so we were able to go straight inside. Just as the decor of the restaurant carries a distinct and intricate woody theme, so does the aroma, the smell of earthy steeped tea filling the air.

Wine production worldwide is estimated at 259 million hectoliters(Mhl) in 2016, down five percent compared to that of 2015, the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) announced here on Thursday.
According to OIV, global wine consumption is estimated to reach between 239.7 and 246.6 Mhl.
Italy will be the world's leading wine producer, with a production volume of 48.8 Mhl. It is followed by France and Spain, respectively at 41.9 Mhl and 37.8 Mhl, OIV estimated.
As the fourth largest wine producer this year, production in the United States is estimated to reach a new record level in 2016, or 22.5 Mhl, while Australia's production is estimated at 12.5 Mhl, up five percent compared to 2015 and is relatively stable over the period from 2012 to 2015, according to OIV.
China, a major new world wine market, maintained its production level of 11.5 Mhl in 2016, securing its place as the world's sixth largest wine producer, OIV said.
In South America, the output of three main producers, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, is in net decline, said the organization, adding Argentina registered in 2016 a sharp decline with a production of 8.8 Mhl, 35 percent less than that of 2015.
At the same time, wine production in Chile this year is expected to fall down to 10.1 million hectoliters, a level very close to that of 2014 (10.5 million hl), registering a significant decline relative to the 12.9 Mhl wine it produced in 2015. Brazil's production has fell down to 1.4 Mhl in 2016, a decrease of 50 percent compared to 2015, OIV said, explaining that the production of the three countries was affected by climatic events.
South Africa, with a production of 9.1 Mhl, saw its production level in 2016 decline by 19 percent from 2015, according to OIV.




 
Terrence Curtin, CEO of TE Connectivity.
We understand the Belt and Road Initiative's significance in promoting economic growth and regional cooperation, and we appreciate the tremendous efforts China has put into this gigantic project.
We regard the many infrastructure projects proposed under the framework of this initiative as enhancing connectivity across Asia, Europe and Africa. This presents a large opportunity for TE, as we are well positioned to offer our unparalleled connectivity and sensing technologies and products in the energy infrastructure, ICT (information and communication technologies) infrastructure, railway links and many other sectors.
We are also encouraged by the China's welcome attitude to foreign participation into this project. As the Belt and Road forum will gather many world leaders to discuss the road map forward in Beijing, I believe companies like TE will have more opportunities to participate in the initiative and contribute to its success.

GUANGZHOU - Several neighborhoods in the northern part of Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, have been flooded after intense rainstorms hit the area on Sunday morning.
Rainstorms hit northern Guangzhou early Sunday morning, causing landslides in mountainous areas while flooding several towns, the Guangdong provincial meteorological bureau said.
Precipitation in the Huadu, Huangpu and Zengcheng districts of Guangzhou reached 250 millimeters. There were reports of people being trapped in at least seven villages. A dike breach was also spotted in Huadong township.
More than 200 armed police officers and flood rescuers have been dispatched.
BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.
Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."
Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."
CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."

GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.
BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.

Wildlife movie coproduction shows angle not known to many
Born in China, a Chinese-American wildlife documentary coproduction, has been offering US moviegoers a feast for the eyes and food for thought since opening in US theaters a day before Earth Day, April 22.
The film's stunning imagery was captured over three years, largely in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces, and it follows the lives of pandas, golden monkeys and snow leopards, with additional footage of red-crowned cranes and chiru, or Tibetan antelopes. It was coproduced by Disneynature and Shanghai Media Group.
"The film serves to increase humans' awareness of the importance and urgency of protecting wildlife," Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said at a reception at China's embassy in Washington on Friday.
"Besides, we can learn much from animals, such as pandas, on how to coexist peacefully and harmoniously," Cui told a group of US guests before the showing of the film.
Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of the US State Department, told China Daily, "It would be good for American audiences to see Chinese people caring about the planet, and conserving wildlife and natural spaces."
Roy Conli, producer of Born in China, said he had been "totally unaware" of the wilderness of China, including what was happening on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and in the mountains of Sichuan, before the making of the film.
"It just shows you how wondrous this planet is," said Conli, the Oscar-winning producer of Big Hero 6. "We need to protect animal populations ... in order to protect ourselves."
For Lu Chuan, an accomplished Chinese director, directing the film allowed him to share the beauty of China, and Chinese people's attitude toward life.
"This is a film that will tell our audience that besides Beijing and Shanghai, and besides heavy industries and pollution, China has incredibly beautiful sides that many are hardly aware of - the crystal clear skies, the stunning sceneries and wildlife habitats," Lu said.
In addition to appearing at US theaters, Born in China will be rendered into a dozen languages and later released in over 100 countries and regions, according to Cui Yuying, vice-minister of the State Council Information Office.
Cui said the China-US coproduction is emblematic of the decision at the April Mar-a-Lago meeting of President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump to ratchet up bilateral exchanges, including cultural and people-to-people exchanges.
"The State Council Information Office welcomes and will continue to support international organizations to tell China stories ... to ramp up understanding and friendship between Chinese and people in the US and the rest of the world," she said.
The film's Chinese version was released in August. A trailer is available at nature.disney.com.

PARIS - The campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said in a statement late Friday it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
A large trove of documents were released online earlier Friday including emails, accounting documents and contracts from the campaign of the centrist candidate.
The files were posted anonymously on a sharing website and the person responsible for the posting remains unclear.
Macron's political movement En Marche! (On the Move) later confirmed that it had been hacked.
"The files circulating were obtained several weeks ago by hacking into private and public mailboxes of several leaders of the movement," said the statement.
It also said the leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation."
"It is not a simple hacking operation but an attempt to destabilize the French presidential election," said the movement, adding that it will "take all necessary initiatives with public and private actors" to clarify the incident.
The leakage happened within the final hours of the last campaigning day. Macron is to face off with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote on Sunday.
Macron has maintained his centriest position over Le Pen, according to surveys conducted by French pollsters.
The latest poll released on Thursday by the French Institute of Public Opinion showed that 61 percent of votes will go to Macron and 40 percent to Le Pen, consistent with the poll conducted before.




 
It was a sweltering Saturday afternoon when the mercury hit 90 degrees around 3 pm; Nikki White was one of the many sitting on the edge of the sidewalk across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
She was one of tens of thousands of protesters in Washington participating in the People's Climate March on Saturday.
The protesters started from Capitol Hill around 12:30 pm and marched on Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House, ending at the Washington Monument.
White said she was quite disappointed in US President Donald Trump for doubting climate change.
"So he won't fund it; he takes away funds from it," she told China Daily, referring Trump's plan to cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
White noted that climate change affects every country. "A decision made in the US affects Canada," said White, who is originally from the US but moved to Canada. She was visiting her family in Washington.
"Anything he stands for has nothing to do with what I stand for. It's the opposite," White said.
During his presidential campaign, Trump called climate change a "hoax" created by the Chinese and said he will pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. Since taking office, his administration has rolled back some Obama-era regulations on fossil fuels.
On Friday, the EPA removed some climate change information from its website. In a press release, the EPA said the website is undergoing changes to reflect the agency's new direction under Trump and administrator Scott Pruitt.
In a rally on Saturday evening in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump said he will make a big decision regarding the Paris accord next week, but did not provide details.
An estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people took part in the rally in Washington on Saturday, according to The Washington Post, quoting the number given to the National Park Service by march organizers. Saturday was Trump's 100th day in office.
The same People's Climate March, which originated in New York in September 2014, also took place on the same day in many other US cities as well as some cities outside the US.
Robert Labaree came from Boston to join the rally in Washington. He said his wife participated in the Boston rally.
"The administration is just too deep in the pocket of large corporations, especially the fossil fuel industry. It seems quite clear," he told China Daily. He also took part in the tax rally on April 15 and science march on April 22, both in Boston.
Marching in the procession included a brass band. Some were dancing while holding their signs. The signs were mostly colorful. One blue sign read "Protect Water" while a red one said "Planet on Fire".
One man, with a white beard and wearing a green cap, held a sign that proclaimed "Oceans Are Rising, So Are We."
An elderly woman sitting in a wheelchair held a sign that reads: "I am 91, Mother Earth is even older than me, Respect your elders."
Another woman, her body wrapped with a US national flag, held a sign stating "Climate Patriot."
A Gallup poll released on March 14 shows that a record percentage of Americans are concerned about global warming, believe it is occurring, consider it a serious threat and say it is caused by human activity.
The perceptions are up significantly from a 2015 poll. Some 45 percent of Americans now say they worry "a great deal" about global warming, up from 37 percent a year ago and significantly higher than the low point of 25 percent in 2011.
Another 21 percent say they worry "a fair amount" about global warming, while only 18 percent say they worry "only a little"; 16 percent said they worry "not at all".
Randy Orwig, from North Carolina, told China Daily that he went to the protest to make sure the environment is taken seriously.
Orwig said he doesn't believe Trump represents the long-term interests of the United States and the world.
"We are going to resist. We are going to find ways to work around him. We are going to be working in the local governments, municipal governments and continue to make climate important," he told China Daily.
China and the US are the two largest carbon emitters in the world, but per capital carbon emission in the US is more than twice that in China.

YOKOHAMA — The Belt and Road Initiative is very important and will certainly have a good impact on regional growth and prosperity, said Mitsuhiro Furusawa, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on Saturday.
Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of Silk Road.
The initiative is very important to foster regional cooperation in areas of trade, investment and finance and to provide much needed infrastructure for the region, Furusawa said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua here on the sidelines of the 50th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank.
Furusawa said, "Global growth is picking up, and also in China ... We see the growth momentum," he said.
Last month, the IMF upgraded its forecast for China's economic growth in 2017 to 6.6 percent, and global economic growth to 3.5 percent, both up 0.1 percentage points from its January projections.
As for the ongoing process of the Chinese RMB's internationalization, he said that it is both beneficial for China and for other countries.
"The Chinese currency's internationalization goes hand in hand with Chinese economic growth. We hope that Chinese RMB will be internationalized, as it was already included in SDR basket of currencies," he said.
This year marked the 20th anniversary of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Furusawa said that the world has learned a lot from the Asian financial crisis.
"Good policies are the best defense," he said, adding that a lot of progress has been made by Asian countries to prevent a recurrence of the crisis, including having more flexible exchange systems, enhancing regional cooperation, and creating financial safety nets.
The IMF is also making its own contributions to this progress, with its various tools, policy advice and financial assistance, and by creating a stronger global financial safety net, he added.
"There are always risks and challenges ... We should always wrestle with those challenges," he said.

[Photo/Agencies]
WASHINGTON - As a sudden but predicted victory for US President Donald Trump, Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday pushed through a new version of American Health Care Act aimed to repeal and replace Obamacare, by 217 to 213 votes.
The bill was passed in the House with only one more vote than needed. All Democrats voted against the bill on the House floor, while 20 Republicans voted no. The Obamacare repeal, one of Trump's key campaign promises, would usher in sweeping changes to the US health care system in the coming years.
TRUMP EXALTS VICTORY
The vote was thought a major breakthrough for Trump who failed to get any major legislations passed by the Congress during his first 100 days in the White House.
Following the voting, Trump, together with Vice President Mike Pence and dozens of House Republicans, celebrated the victory at the White House Rose Garden, touting the bill as a "great plan" while claiming Obamacare "essentially dead."
"This has really brought the Republican Party together," Trump said. "As much as we've come up with a really incredible health care plan, this has brought the Republican Party together. We're going to get this finished."
"It's going to be an unbelievable victory... when we get it through the Senate." he said.
"A lot of us have been waiting seven years to cast this vote," House Speaker Paul Ryan said earlier Thursday.
House Republican leaders had scrambled for enough support before the voting after having a series of changes added since an earlier version was pulled from a House floor voting at last minute in March.
Also on the day, frustrated Democrats warned that the Obamacare repeal will leave Americans worse off.
"Make no mistake, many people will die as a result of this bill," House lawmaker Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida, said on ABC.
Sensing the challenges ahead in the Senate, Pence told the crowd: "Welcome to the beginning of the end of Obamacare."
BEIJING - The People's Bank of China, the central bank, will issue a set of gold and silver coins on Monday commemorating the upcoming Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on May 14 and 15.
Consisting of one gold coin and two silver, the set will be legal tender in China, the central bank said in a statement.
The front side of each coin features China's national emblem, along with the country name and the year of issuance.
The 3-gram gold coin, with a face value of 50 yuan ($7.26), features the forum's logo, the Chinese and English names for the forum and lotus decoration on the reverse side.
The 30-gram and 15-gram silver coins, with face values of 10 yuan and 5yuan, will also have the forum's logo and full name in both languages, but with different decoration patterns on the reverse sides, according to the statement.

CHICAGO - A passenger, who was violently dragged off an overbooked United flight has reached a settlement with the airline, his lawyer said on Thursday.
Thomas Demetrio, a prominent Chicago attorney representing the 69-year-old David Dao, said in a news release that "the United has taken full responsibility for what happened on Fight 3411" on April 9.
He didn't disclose the sum, which should "remain confidential" as agreed by the two sides.
Dao, a Vietnamese-American doctor, was hospitalized after three aviation policemen at Chicago O'Hare International Airport was summoned aboard and dragged him from the plane to make space for four crew members on the flight bound for Louisville, Kentucky.
He suffered concussion, a broken nose and lost two front teeth, which led to an online uproar against the misconduct.
Demetrio praised United for taking "full responsibility for what happened on Flight 3411, without attempting to blame others, including the City of Chicago."

Oysters wreak havoc on Denmark's seashore. Photo from Danish Embassy's Sina Weibo account.
The Danish Embassy published a story on Monday evening on its official Sina Weibo account, China's twitter-like social network, about the problems for their country caused by an invasion of the exotic oysters. Chinese internet users enthusiastically responded with much discussion about ways to address the issue on Weibo, then WeChat, another popular social media network.
The embassy makes a small joke in the post to invite Chinese people to eat oysters in Denmark which triggered heated debate. Apparently, when it comes to eating, Chinese people are very serious and they already started to make plans for their oyster journey.
The most popular comment came from someone suggesting oyster visas should be issued "with 10 years' unlimited round trips and one-month-long stay and I can eat up them all in five years" received over 10,000 likes. There are people even recommending visa-free and oyster immigration policies in China.
Chinese internet users make comments below the Danish Embassy's post to address the oyster issue. Screeshot of the Danish Embassy's Sina Weibo
The oysters, known as Pacific oysters, are a new species in Denmark and have caused huge damage to the seashore's ecological environment. Their proliferation is unstoppable since they have no natural enemies there. People have to get across them in shoes before swimming. What's worse, their occupation leads to the endangerment of the Limfjord, a Danish local oyster.
Scientists and fishermen made numerous complaints to the nation's conservation authority but the thorny issue remains unsolved. They also encouraged local people to bring them to their dining tables and few were motivated.
The Danish Embassy is very grateful for Chinese people's innovative advice such as building oyster sauce factories and organizing oyster-dining journeys. It also said as long as China permits, they'd love to export oysters to China.
China and South Africa's relationship will reach new heights when Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Yandong makes an official visit to the country this month.
A major part of Liu's visit to the southernmost tip of the African continent is to launch the China-South Africa High-Level People-to-People and Cultural Exchanges Mechanism, which will be co-hosted with Nathi Mthethwa, South Africa's minister of arts and culture.
This mechanism, the first of its kind between China and African countries, covers cooperation in a wide range of areas such as education, culture, science and technology, health, youth, women, media, think tanks, tourism, sports and local friendship.
Speaking at a regular news conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Liu's visit to South Africa is seen as an important part of the consensus reached by the two heads of state.

"This mechanism is of high significance aswe build up popular support for China-South Africa friendship, deepen our comprehensive strategic partnership and expand people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Africa," Geng said.
During the visit, Liu will also meet with South African President Jacob Zuma and attend the China-Africa Conference on Health Cooperation, the China-South Africa seminar on industrial park cooperation, the China-South Africa High-Level Dialogue and the closing ceremony of the second China-Africa Youth Gala.
South Africa is the last stop during her four-nation tour, which also was to take her to Turkey, Jordan and Iran. In Turkey, Liu conveyed President Xi Jinping's greetings to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and congratulated him on the passage of Turkey's constitutional referendum.
With the backing of Xi and Zuma, the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and South Africa has been growing.
Foremost, the visit of Liu to South Africa is important because the solid foundation of Africa-China engagements is cemented by mutual high-level visits, says Bob Wekesa, post-doctoral fellow at the University of the Witwatersr in Johannesburg.
The cultural exchanges mechanism launched during the visit builds on the existing engagements and will likely see to the implementation of tangible and pragmatic projects at the economic, political and social levels, says Wekesa.
"Without exchanges, the engagements would be limited to high-level relations, and this would not aid the benefits that arise when academics, businesspeople and ordinary Africans and Chinese people make contact with, and learn from, each other."
"The exchange mechanism launched during the visit will indeed spur the implementation of the people-to-people initiatives," says Wekesa.
In September 2015, Zuma attended the Commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1937-45) and the World War II in Beijing.
This was closely followed by a state visit from Xi to South Africa in December 2015, during which the China-South Africa 5-10 Year Framework on Cooperation was signed.
Xi and Zuma co-chaired the Johannesburg Summit, which came as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation marked the 15th anniversary of its establishment and is the first summit between the two sides on the African continent.
The historic meeting, which approved a declaration and an action plan for cooperation in the coming three years, has strengthened solidarity and cooperation between China and Africa. The upcoming China-South Africa High-Level People-to-People and Cultural Exchanges Mechanism is a concrete example of implementing the outcomes of the FOCAC.
South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the two countries are enjoying strong growth momentum, with deals worth more than 94 billion rand ($7.1 billion; 6.6 billion euros; ￡5.5 billion) signed during Xi's visit - making it the most successful state visit in South African history.
"The subsequent Johannesburg Summit assured us of China's commitment not only to South Africa, but to the entire African continent," he says.
"The outcomes of these two events are changing the lives of our people, not only in South Africa but also on the African continent, and are offering new opportunities for growth and development at a number of levels, but more especially at an economic level," Ramaphosa adds.
Trade between the two countries grew from 118 billion rand to 293 billion rand by the end of 2015, making China the biggest trading partner of South Africa.
More than 300 Chinese companies are in South Africa, and among them, about 140 are large and medium-sized companies, according to a report by the South Africa-China Economic and Trade Association.
The report says the Chinese enterprises employed more than 26,000 people in South Africa, of whom 24,000 were locals, and Chinese investment in South Africa exceeded $13 billion by the end of 2015.

SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions."
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back".
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors.
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being.
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions.
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership."
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.




 
The war against malaria has made progress over the past decade, but there is still a long way to go, and Chinese researchers are leading the way on more than one front.
Roughly half of the world's population - 3 billion people - still remains at risk.
In 2006, there were 266 million cases a year leading to 750,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.
By 2015, the numbers had diminished, but remained huge - 212 million cases, 429,000 deaths.
And a staggering 90 percent of all cases are in Africa.
Dr Deng Changsheng, manager of the department of science and technology at Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, told a group of 27 journalists visiting from Africa recently, that strategy used to cause a major decline in malarial regions of China is showing promise in Africa.
The approach is called fast elimination of malaria by source eradication (FEMSE). It involves mass drug administration (MDA) of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) - in other words, clearing an affected population of the malarial parasites by mass drug administration.
Artemisinin, by the way, is the drug that won 85-year-old Chinese pharmacologist Tu Youyou the 2015 Nobel Prize for Medicine. She had mined the recipe, derived from the sweet wormwood plant, from the annals of ancient Chinese medicine. Today it saves hundreds of thousands of lives a year in Africa alone.
The drug has not been cheap, but Deng said the cost could be brought to as low as $15 per person over the next decade. Today it's about $40, according to Deng.
Thanks to a worldwide push, ACT treatments rose from 187 million in 2010 to 311 million in 2015.
The big fear facing the effort right now is that the parasites are showing signs of developing a resistance to artemisinin, the same way some strains of tuberculosis are shunning off some of modern medicine's most potent antibiotics.
"The spread of artemisinin resistance in Africa would be a major setback in the fight against malaria, as ACT is the only effective and widely used anti-malarial treatment at the moment," writes Professor Arnab Pain of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
"Therefore it is very important to regularly monitor artemisinin resistance on a worldwide scale," he added.
The study, led by Jun Cao of the Institute for Parasitic Diseases in China, found drug-resistant malarial parasites in a Chinese patient who had been in Equatorial Guinea and returned to China. The ACT therapy, which usually takes three days to rid the patient of the disease, took five days in this case.
This "partial resistance", they said, has been noted in other parts of Southeast Asia, and the great fear is that "partial" morphs into "complete".
"This is one of the great challenges facing us in the fight against malaria," the World Health Organization says on its website.
The holy grail of that fight, of course, remains a vaccine, and The Associated Press reports that three African nations have just been chosen to test the world's first malaria vaccine.
WHO announced Monday that Ghana, Kenya and Malawi will begin piloting an injectable vaccine next year with hundreds of thousands of young children, who have been at highest risk of death.
The vaccine, which has partial effectiveness, has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives if used with existing measures, WHO's regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said in a statement. The challenge is whether impoverished countries can deliver the required four doses of the vaccine for each child.
The vaccine will be tested on children 5 to 17 months old to see whether its protective effects shown so far in clinical trials can hold up under real-life conditions. At least 120,000 children in each of the three countries will receive the vaccine, which has taken decades of work and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.
Kenya, Ghana and Malawi were chosen for the vaccine pilot because all have strong prevention and vaccination programs but continue to have high numbers of malaria cases, WHO said. The countries will deliver the vaccine through their existing vaccination programs.
WHO is hoping to wipe out malaria by 2040, despite the increasing resistance problems to both drugs and insecticides used to kill mosquitoes.
The vaccine was developed by GlaxoSmithKline, and the $49 million for the first phase of the pilot is being funded by the global vaccine alliance GAVI, UNITAID and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.




 
Jose claims his former club more concerned with tie than United
Jose Mourinho said Manchester United's FA Cup quarterfinal against Chelsea will preoccupy the Blues more because they are in fewer competitions than his Red Devils.
United battled into the last eight with a 2-1 fifth-round victory at second-tier struggler Blackburn Rovers on Sunday.
Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic came off the bench to combine for the latter to net a second-half winner at Ewood Park, maintaining United's interest in four competitions.
Premier League leader Chelsea is chasing the domestic league and FA Cup double, but, with no European involvement for the Londoners, Mourinho was quick to revert to his favored mind games when asked about drawing his former club.
"I have no reaction," said the United manager.
"I have to play Saint-Etienne (in the Europa League), I have to play the final, I have to play, hopefully, another game in the Europa League, I have to fight for a top-four position in the Premier League.
"So I have so many things to think about. Probably Chelsea can only think about that because they are champions (elect).
"They have nothing else to play for. The FA Cup is something I believe is important for them."
United has not won at Stamford Bridge since 2012, and most recently in west London slumped to a 4-0 October loss, Mourinho's worst Premier League result.
This week United travels to France with a 3-0 lead for the second leg of its Europa League last-32 tie against Saint-Etienne and then plays Southampton in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday.
United's scheduling problems might have been worse had it faced an FA Cup replay against Blackburn.
After Danny Graham's Rovers opener was canceled out by England striker Marcus Rashford, that appeared a likely outcome.
But Pogba and Ibrahimovic combined for a goal that underlined their growing understanding as the latter took his season tally to 24 goals in all competitions.
'Right attitude'
"People learn how to play together, that's normal," said Mourinho.
"They've played together for seven or eight months, so I think the connection between quality players is helped by time.
"The number of goals Zlatan would score, I didn't know. I knew he would be a very important player for us.
"I didn't know whether it would be one more or one less goal, but I knew what his contribution would be."
In contrast to his criticism following Thursday's triumph over Saint-Etienne, Mourinho was complimentary of all his players, and was relieved they avoided the same fate that befell top-flight Burnley and Leicester against lower-league opposition on Saturday.
"Today they were ready," said the Portuguese.
"I think they felt it was a really difficult match and I think what happened yesterday, with every Premier League team in difficult situations, was one more alert.
"So the players knew it would be difficult and came out with the right attitude. I'm pleased with that."
Mourinho will travel to Saint-Etienne without Wayne Rooney and Phil Jones, who missed the Blackburn game with injuries and are doubtful for Sunday's League Cup final.
Blackburn boss Owen Coyle must now focus on the 1995 Premier League champion's relegation battle.
"We showed today that we are not a coat of paint away from being a very good team," he said.

LONDON - French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron told British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday not to expect any favours from the European Union during Brexit talks, and drew big cheers for his pro-EU message from French nationals in London.
Macron visited May at her Downing Street office and later met Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond, a public relations coup for the young ex-banker at a time when his campaign appears to be losing momentum.
"Brexit cannot lead to a kind of optimisation of Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe. An exit is an exit," he told reporters outside 10 Downing Street after meeting May.
"I am very determined that there will be no undue advantages."
Macron, 39, a former economy minister in Socialist President Francois Hollande's government, is running as an independent. He is due to unveil his detailed programme next week.
The latest polls suggest he and right-wing rival Francois Fillon are tied behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead of the first round of the election on April 23. Polls suggest either man would easily beat Le Pen in the May 7 run-off.
Macron, who did not obtain a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a recent visit to Berlin, was keen to improve his standing on the world stage and court voters in London, which has an estimated 200,000 French residents.
Sacramento pulls off multi-player deal to send All-Star to Pelicans
SACRAMENTO - Sacramento Kings general manager Vlade Divac headed into All-Star weekend convinced it was finally time to part ways with ultra-talented center DeMarcus Cousins.
Befitting a franchise that appears headed to a 11th straight season without a playoff berth, the Kings even seemed to botch that.
On Sunday, Sacramento dealt Cousins and forward Omri Casspi to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Tyreke Evans, 2016 first-round draft pick Buddy Hield, Langston Galloway and first- and second-round draft picks this summer.

When asked why he didn't wait for a better offer closer to Thursday's trade deadline, Divac gave a curious response that raised more questions than it answered.
"Most likely we would get less because I had a better deal two days ago," Divac said. "I don't want to go into details. I don't want to discuss the process."
Cousins will now team Anthony Davis, another former Kentucky big man who has developed into an NBA All-Star in New Orleans.
Cousins has averaged 27.8 points and 10.6 rebounds this season and can become a free agent in 2018 unless the Pelicans can sign him to an All-Star caliber extension.
The Kings have not won more than 33 games in a season since drafting Cousins fifth overall in 2010 and they grew tired of his antics that included frequent run-ins with coaches, media personnel and officials.
He leads the NBA with 17 technical fouls this season, leading to a one-game suspension earlier this month. He will be suspended again after his next technical foul and every two beyond that for the remainder of the regular season.
Divac frequently mentioned culture and character when explaining the thought behind the deal, saying the franchise needed a change despite being only 1 1/2 games behind Denver for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
"I really love DeMarcus," Divac said. "I think he's a great kid. It just wasn't a fit right now with what we're trying to do. I wish him all the best. I hope this will have a positive effect on his career."
The deal to pair Cousins with Davis sends a message that the Pelicans are more concerned with making a 25-game push for the playoffs this spring then where they'll be drafting next offseason.
New Orleans GM Dell Demps' previous attempts to provide Davis a requisite supporting cast has been under increasing scrutiny as losses have mounted. The Pelicans are 23-34, 2 1/2 games out of the final playoff spot in the West with 25 games left.
When the deal was made official on Monday, Demps thanked Pelicans owner Tom Benson and top executives Mickey Loomis and Dennis Lauscha for their "continued support and providing the resources for us to be successful".
"This is an exciting time for Pelicans fans as we continue our quest for long-term success," Demps said.
The Kings, who are a game ahead of the Pelicans in the standings, will now enter rebuilding mode without Cousins.
Sacramento could deal other veterans for prospects or picks before Thursday's deadline, but even the rebuilding plan has issues.
The Kings could be forced to swap first-round picks with Philadelphia this year and also owe the 76ers an unprotected 2019 pick as part of a trade in July 15 made to create salary-cap room to sign Rajon Rondo, Kosta Koufos and Marco Belinelli. Only Koufos is still in Sacramento.
This trade does increase the Kings' chances at two first-round picks this year because they only have to give up their top pick to Chicago if it falls outside the top 10.
"We feel very strong about this draft this year," Divac said. "It's very strong, stronger than the past few years. It's time to start fresh."
The Kings also get the 23-year-old Hield, who won the Wooden Award at Oklahoma last year before being drafted sixth overall by the Pelicans.
Hield has struggled as a rookie, averaging 8.6 points per game in 20.4 minutes per contest, while shooting 39.2 percent from the field and 36.9 percent from 3-point range.
"He's talented guy," Divac said. "His work ethic is exactly what we want here."
Evans, who can play point guard, shooting guard or small forward, will be entering a second stint in Sacramento, where he was drafted in 2009 and went on to be NBA rookie of the year. Galloway has been a solid reserve, providing scoring punch from the perimeter. Casspi has been playing about 19 minutes a game for the Kings this season, averaging 5.9 points.

Magic Johnson was named the president of basketball operations for the struggling Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday as one of the NBA's most storied franchises undergoes a major shakeup to the their front office.
In addition to promoting Johnson, a Hall of Famer who won five NBA titles with Los Angeles in the 1980s, Lakers Governor Jeanie Buss fired longtime general manager Mitch Kupchak and her brother, Jim, from his role as vice president of basketball operations.
"I took these actions today to achieve one goal: Everyone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by Earvin and myself," said Jeanie Buss. "We are determined to get back to competing to win NBA championships again."
Kupchak was in his 30th season working in the team's front office while Jim Buss, son of former Lakers owner Jerry Buss, joined the team in 1998.
The Lakers, who last week were ranked second in Forbes' list of most valuable NBA teams at $3 billion, are in the midst of one of the worst on-court stretches in their history.
Earlier this month the Lakers hired Johnson to advise ownership on basketball and business in a role the team said would include collaborating with coaches, mentoring players and assessing future franchise needs.
He called his newest role a "dream come true" and pledged to work tirelessly to get the team back to the top of the NBA.
"Since 1979, I've been a part of the Laker Nation and I'm passionate about this organization," said Johnson. "I will do everything I can to build a winning culture on and off the court."
Johnson, 57, who ended his 12-year career with the Lakers in 1991 after he was diagnosed with HIV, was a minority owner of the team for several years after his retirement and built a business that owns movie theaters, health clubs and other properties.
Johnson, who staged a brief NBA comeback in 1996, was the face of a group that bought Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers for $2 billion in 2012. That group also bought Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC and WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks.
Los Angeles have not made the postseason since losing in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs and, with a 19-39 record that has them sitting second-last in the Western Conference, are headed to a fourth consecutive losing campaign.

After being held in China for eight years, the Advantage Austria Ski Race for the first time was won by a Chinese racer on Saturday at Zhangjiakou's Genting Secret Garden Resort, Hebei province, with Liu Ji crossing the finish line in 51.75 seconds, ahead of an Austrian racer.
The race, which is regarded as a networking platform for the Austrian-Chinese winter sports community, attracted 110 racers from China and all over the world.
"Actually, now we have more Chinese participants than Austrians, which is fantastic," said Martin Glatz, head of Advantage Austria Beijing and commercial counselor at the Austrian embassy. He said it reflected the growth of winter sports in China.
Since Beijing and its neighboring city, Zhangjiakou, won the right in 2015 to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, China has been promoting its national campaign to encourage 300 million people to participate in winter sports.
In November, the General Administration of Sport of China released plans to construct winter sports infrastructure and popularize winter sports, calling for at least 650 skating rinks and 800 ski resorts to be built across the country by 2022 and the winter sports industry to be valued at 1 trillion yuan ($144.5 billion) by 2025.
Zhan Weiping, vice chairman of the Austria-China Friendship Association, told China Daily website that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics could bring more business opportunities to Austrian companies.
Austria, having a long tradition of winter sports, was one of the first countries to develop ski resorts, technologies related to winter sports and a winter sports industry. Zhan said more Austrian winter sports companies are now very interested in China's market.
"Some of them have already entrusted me to bring their projects to China. They are looking forward to working with Chinese investors and distributors and considering establishing factories in China," Zhan said.
He believes Austria and China can take advantage of each other's strengths as Austrian companies can bring technology, brands and management models and their Chinese partners can offer capital, place and local support.
For those Austrian companies already in China's market, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics can also be regarded as a boost.
Austrian company AST, a supplier of ice skating rinks, has been operating for 12 years in the Chinese market. Zhong Shuai, general manager of AST China, said the company was involved in the building and operation of more than 50 percent of the ice skating rinks in China by 2015.
"The winter sports industry needs long-term investment. And the return of investment is related to the market scale," he said the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics could boost a healthy development of winter sports industry in China.
More information on China's winter sports market and Austrian winter sports companies' development in China can be found in China Daily website's interview with Martin Glatz. The following are edited excerpts of the interview:

Smart hearables－you read it right. No typo there, by the way.
You may own or have heard of smart wearables, multipurpose gadgets in the form of wrist-bands, bracelets, necklaces, so on. They could soon become old hat as versatile hearables are in.
For example, a smart headphone can not only play music but "learn" about your preferences and program itself to play what you will enjoy. Beijing-based startup Vinci will ensure that.
"People are able to communicate with Vinci. You just need to say what you want, such as the name, singer, style of the music and your mood, and then the headphone will do as you ordered. We combine the hardware devices with software to create a new music experience," said David Zhu, Vinci's founder and CEO.
The startup is pioneering voice-controlled, eponymously branded headphones powered by artificial intelligence and featuring immersive 3-D sound. The startup is at the forefront of innovation in the hearable devices industry.
In December 2016, Vinci was crowd-funded on Kickstarter, the world's largest such platform for creative projects, obtaining $987,384.
Its achievements are brightening the record of China's headphone products in overseas markets.
Its headphones double up as personal assistants. A user can also check the weather, find local restaurants, schedule an appointment or dictate a text by just asking the headphone.
Vinci's headphones work independently of mobile phones, thus delivering on-the-go convenience.
That's not all. Like wearables, they can measure your heartbeat rate and track your physical activity like running, using built-in sensors and GPS technology.
Zhu said he got the inspiration for hearable technology from observing people's outdoor music listening habits.
"We found many people listen to music while walking outside, but they use several things such as earphone, smartphone, armband for the purpose. We wanted to create an easier way for them to listen to music," Zhu said, adding the all-in-one device makes for a good companion.
The screens on both sides of the headphone show the music that is being played, and users could stop or pause the music, or change the volume, by just swiping or tapping the screen.
Founded in 2014, the firm is making its presence felt in the mobile technology sector. It now has about 60 employees, with 80 percent of them driving research and development. Most of them graduated from top universities and have worked at big tech companies such as Baidu Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for five to 10 years.
Vinci the firm introduced 10,000 units of Vinci 1.0 headphones in 2015. Each smart hearable costs 1,799 yuan ($262). It plans to launch Vinci 1.5 later this month.
"The smart headphone market will witness an explosive growth this year, and many tech giants will tap into this field in the second half of 2017. With the rise of artificial intelligence and voice interaction, this field will definitely be hot," Zhu said.
Liu Ting, a clerk at an educational institution, said: "I want to have a try as I have never used this kind of device to listen to music before. I could talk with my headphone? That's very cool."
'Assistants' set for explosive growth
The electronics segment related to voice-operated smart or artificial intelligence-powered gadgets is seeing explosive growth, with personal assistant devices leading the way.
Amazon's Alexa, the voice service that powers Echo, provides capabilities or skills that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice.
Examples of these skills include the ability to play preferred music, answer general questions and set an alarm or timer.
Among AI-powered personal assistants, Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana are prominent names.
iFlytek Co, a leading Chinese firm engaged in speech- and voice-recognition technologies, has made much efforts to promote the application of intelligent voice technology in mobile phones, automobiles, home appliances, toys and a number of other fields.
It has garnered more than 70 percent of market share in the Chinese speech technology market, and taken the lead in the formation of the Chinese speech industry supply chain.
According to the statistics from Speech Industry Alliance of China (SIAC) the scale of the global intelligent voice industry will reach $10.5 billion by 2017, with a growth rate of 29.6 percent.
Technology consultancy Gartner Inc predicts that 30 percent of human interactions with technology will be through "conversations" with smart machines by 2018.
The voice-based AI technology is now widely used in the intelligent home field. Users can use voice to control lighting, thermostat, home appliances, garage shutter and even security systems.
Andrew Ng, Baidu Inc's chief scientist, said: "As speech recognition accuracy goes from 95 percent to 99 percent, all of us in the room will go from barely using it to using it all the time."
According to comScore, 50 percent of all searches will be voice searches by 2020.

China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, the country's largest missile maker, will step up global expansion this year, as it aims to quintuple the number of foreign enterprises registered on its industrial internet platform.
Wei Yiyin, deputy general manager of CASIC, said less than 2,000 foreign companies have registered on its online industrial internet platform－casicloud.com.
"We aim to increase the number to 10,000 by the end of this year as our company ramps up efforts to promote our services to Pakistan, Europe and Southeast Asia," Wei said.
The industrial internet refers to combining advanced machines with internet-connected sensors and big-data analytics. It is designed to boost the productivity, efficiency, and reliability of industrial production.
CASIC's casicloud industrial internet platform went into operation in June, 2015. Via the platform, CASIC offers enterprises cloud-based technology and products that can help upgrade plant.
According to CASIC's Wei, the company has partnered with Germany's Siemens AG to work on smart manufacturing.
The move came as China is ramping up efforts to upgrade its manufacturing industry with the big data and internet technology.
"We are working on a national guideline to promote the development of the industrial internet," Minister of Industry and Information Technology Miao Wei said on Tuesday.
The industrial internet is highlighted in the country's Made in China 2025 strategy, which was designed to promote high-end manufacturing.
"We have done a relatively good job in applying the internet to industrial production. This year we will see big opportunities in the high-tech manufacturing sector," the minister added.
Geng said that China expects the upcoming visit to improve bilateral ties, as the two sides working to build a new partnership.
Hailing the sound development of bilateral ties, Geng said that the two sides had witnessed close high-level exchanges, and cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment protection, innovation, and the Arctic research had all progressed.

More than 25 million tourists are expected in the Tibet autonomous region this year, its tourism authority announced on Wednesday.
The visitors are expected to generate more than 37 billion yuan ($5.38 billion) in revenue, according to the Tibet tourism development commission.
It is estimated that Tibet's tourism industry will lift 30,000 people out of poverty this year.
Last year, the region received more than 23 million domestic and overseas tourists, up 14.8 percent year-on-year. Total tourism revenue hit more than 33 billion yuan, an increase of 17.3 percent year-on-year.

BEIJING - Fifteen Chinese listed brokerages have estimated profit declines for the last year as thin stock trading dragged down their incomes in commission fees.
Those brokerages, accounting for more than half of the country's publicly traded securities firms, reported combined net profits of 53.66 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) in their preliminary earnings estimates for 2016, only half of the figure seen in 2015, according to RoyalFlush Information, a financial information service provider.
Their total revenues declined nearly 40 percent to 164.87 billion yuan, mainly weighed on by substantial drops in commission fees.
Chinese shares were still in the middle of a sluggish recovery from sharp plunges, prompting investors to be more cautious in making transactions, while booming property sales also drained money from the stock market.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index stood at 3,103.64 points at the end of 2016, down 12.31 percent year on year.
Changjiang Securities Co saw the lowest profit decline, while CITIC Securities Co appeared to be the most profitable brokerage.
Despite lackluster brokerage charges, securities companies saw expanding asset management and investment banking business last year, which grew 8 percent and 29 percent in terms of net income, respectively, data from the Securities Association of China showed.


China could learn from the experience of Tokyo Bay area how to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area, which this year's Government Work Report lists as a central government mission.
Bay areas are important growth points and leaders in technological innovation across the world. World Bank data show about 60 percent of the global economy is concentrated in the river delta regions, and the trend of people moving from inland areas of a country to its coasts has intensified.
The metropolitan zone in the Tokyo Bay area comprises Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures, covering an area of 13,562 square kilometers. Although the Tokyo Bay's metropolitan area adds up to only 3.5 percent of the total land of Japan, it is home to one-third of the country's population and generates one-third of national GDP.
Compared with the densely populated Tokyo Bay area, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area's population of about 100 million is more scattered and concentrated relatively away from the sea, which means there is enough room for development in the coastal areas.
The rise of the new economy, especially the service sector, in the mid-1960s when Shinkansen high-speed trains started operation, led to the influx of people from across Japan to the Tokyo Bay area, which further boosted the growth of the agglomeration economy. This in turn gave rise to big city malaise, which became increasingly serious after the area's population crossed 10 million. Surprisingly, though, after the Tokyo Bay area's population reached 40 million, the big city malaise began subsiding thanks especially to the constant improvements in urban infrastructure and management.
Opening-up gives rise to diversity, and diversity leads to efficiency. Although the Pearl River Delta region, which consists of 11 cities, is no less diverse than the Tokyo Bay area, the economic interaction among and complementarity of the cities are not up to the mark because of the wide gaps among them in terms of opening up to the outside world.
The Tokyo Bay area resorted to harsh environmental protection measures after experiencing a serious pollution crisis, which in turn caused a social crisis in the 1950s and 1960s, and succeeded in solving the industrial pollution problem while upgrading its technology and restructuring the economy.
The measures the Tokyo Bay area adopted to address the problems plaguing it could be important lessons for China to effectively manage its large metropolitan areas and improve their infrastructure, especially because the Pearl River Delta region has to improve its urban management, service sector and infrastructure, transportation in particular, to develop the coastal areas, so as to allow the agglomeration economy to truly flourish.
Besides, the prefecture-level and city-level governments in the Tokyo Bay area have established effective communication channels and mechanisms, so as to coordinate their planning, construction and development, which is exactly what the 11 cities in the Pearl River Delta region should do.
China also has to help develop strong think tanks, because they play an important role in inter-governmental exchanges and communication owing to their greater foresight. The success of the Tokyo Bay area's development indicates China's advanced manufacturing industries should shift to the great bay area to have easier access to global markets and enjoy better industrial interaction.
In all probability, the knowledge-intensive economy, supported by information and communication technology and research and development, as well as the high-end service sector will continue to move into the greater bay area. But to facilitate the process, the Pearl River Delta region needs to further open up to the outside world and be more inclusive in terms of foreign ideas and planning process.
The planning and development of the Pearl River Delta region should also make the environment a compulsory aspect of its development agenda, in order to avoid going through the painstaking and costly environmental-cleansing process of the Tokyo Bay area.

The Palace Museum in Beijing, also called the Forbidden City, said on Friday that it will open its first permanent satellite gallery outside Beijing on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, Fujian province, on May 13.
The Kulangsu Gallery of Foreign Artifacts from the Palace Museum Collections will be in a former hospital that was set up by a Dutch-American missionary in 1898.
The opening exhibition features 219 artifacts including antique clocks, scientific instruments and paintings from abroad. They come from the 16th to the early 20th century.
The artifacts were chosen from the Palace Museum's collection of some 10,000 foreign artifacts, many of which were brought by missionaries and diplomats to the court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Because the museum has lacked a space to present the items, most of those going on display in Xiamen have long been stored in warehouses.
"The Palace Museum has the responsibility to find a place to show the artifacts to give the public a wider view of the world's civilization," said Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. "Due to historical reasons, in Western museums, we can see many items from abroad, but such institutions are quite rare in China."
Gulangyu Island, a top tourist spot once called Kulangsu, hosted the settlements of 13 countries from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, making the 1.88-square-kilometer island a cultural melting pot.
"The island is a center of historical architecture from many countries," Shan said. "Its atmosphere echoes our exhibits from overseas, and is thus a perfect place to display them."
Gulangyu's bid to become a World Heritage Site will be taken up at a UNESCO conference in Poland in July. Ni Chao, a standing member of the Xiamen committee of the Communist Party of China, said the new, 5,168-square-meter museum will be a bonus for the island's cultural landscape.






Workers test samples at an oil field in Aktobe, Kazakhstan. Ren Qi / China Daily
A Chinese company is not only pumping 'black gold' and providing jobs, but also establishing community projects for locals, reports Ren Qi in Aktobe, Kazakhstan
Editor's note: This is the ninth in a series of reports focusing on the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, China's proposed trading route linking Asia, Europe and Africa.
Kazakhstan holds a special place in the history of Belt and Road Initiative, because President Xi Jinping proposed the ambitious initiative during a speech at Nazarbayev University in Astana, the Kazakh capital, in 2013.
China has been working closely with Kazakhstan for about 20 years, mainly in the energy sector. That cooperation has expanded since the launch of the landmark project, which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
Aktobe, in the west, is Kazakhstan's second-largest region but it has the lowest population density in the country, with just 2.6 people per square kilometer.
It's also the location of a prime example of the strong links between the two nations: China National Petroleum Corp AktobeMunaiGas, known as CNPC AMG, Kazakhstan's fifth-largest oil and gas producer.
In June 1997, China National Petroleum Corp, the nation's largest oil and gas producer and supplier, bought a 60.34 percent stake in the Kazakh company and obtained production licenses for three oil fields and a contract for an oil exploration block.
"The acquisition was the company's first investment in Central Asia, and the development of the Aktobe project is a prime example of China's oil and gas cooperation in Kazakhstan," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan Corp, a subsidiary established to oversee operations.
Later, CNPC was awarded four more oil and gas projects in the country, along with two exploration projects and the Kazakhstan-China crude oil pipeline, the Northwest oil pipeline, and phase two of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline.
Construction of the 1,454-kilometer-long western section of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline was completed on April 14. According to the company, the pipeline can now carry more than 5 billion cubic meters a year from Kazakhstan to Chna.
"China is busy building the Silk Road Economic Belt throughout Central Asia, and we see these oil and natural gas pipelines as an 'energy Silk Road'," said Bian Dezhi, general manager of CNPC Kazakhstan.
CNPC now holds 89.17 percent of CNPC AMG, which produced more than 134 million metric tons of crude oil and 72.3 billion cu m of natural gas between 1997 and the end of last year, according to company data.
Wang Junren, general manager of CNPC AMG, said the project has faced several challenges since it was established, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the drop in the price of oil between 2010 and 2015.
"However, thanks to a better energy cooperation environment, such as a higher oil price and positive policies introduced as part of the initiative, the development of CNPC AMG has jumped in the past two years," he said.
"The initiative is an updated version of China's international cooperation model, and the Silk Road Economic Belt is helping to raise the level of sustainable cooperation between China and Kazakhstan," he added.
Wang Yanfeng, deputy chief engineer and head of field operations in Aktobe, said the company's employees have made many sacrifices to ensure the project's success.
After working at the company's oil field in Daqing, Heilongjiang province, for seven years, Wang studied in Moscow from 2001 to 2003 to further his professional skills. After that, he moved to Kazakhstan.
"When I arrived in Aktobe, the company was in a critical situation because the price of oil had almost reached its lowest point and the business was really not smooth. Living and working conditions were also quite poor," he recalled.
The hardest thing was traveling the 270 km between the oil field and the regional capital, also called Aktobe: "The roads were bad, and there were deep potholes all the way to the field, so we had to ride in an open pickup truck for more than eight hours in winter."
Acts of charity
CNPC AMG has signed memorandums of understanding with the Aktobe regional government every year since 1997, and has donated more than $47 million to local charities.
The company has spent more than $694 million to boost local amenities, including subsidizing medical services and building infrastructure, such as hospitals and cultural or religious venues, according to Yury Shikarev, deputy director of the general manager's office.
In 2003, the company bought 80 apartments in downtown Aktobe city. It offered them to World War II veterans free of charge as part of celebrations to mark the 58th anniversary of the end of the war.
"We also spend $63,700 a year on newspaper subscriptions for the old soldiers," he said. "Furthermore, we sponsored a Veterans' Day to commemorate them, which received positive feedback from local people."
Xu Anping, deputy general manager of CNPC AMG, visits the apartments to meet with the veterans every year.
"For a company exploring natural resources in a foreign country, relations with local governments, and especially local communities, are very important," he said.
Xu was one of the first Chinese workers to arrive in Aktobe in 1997. He said the CNPC management team understood the need for positive relations and immediately set about cultivating them.
In the first year, CNPC AMG bought and renovated an old sanatorium. When the work had been completed, the company organized a three-month summer camp for the children of its Chinese and Kazakh employees.
"Now, our summer camp is one of the most famous in Aktobe, or even western Kazakhstan. It has become a fairytale land for the children of the region," Xu said, with pride.

An attractive voice can get you a recording contract, but in China, talking the talk can get you thousands of followers, dollars and a career as a video game anchor.
China is one of the biggest video game markets in the world, having generated 50.46 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) in revenue in 2016.
The tremendous growth in internet penetration rate and the ubiquity of personal devices and handsets have supported the growing trend of the sport at the beginning of the 21st century. In recent years, the popularity of live streaming platforms has led to the rise of a different kind of competition within the gaming industry: battle of the video gaming hosts.
The stakes are high undoubtedly, as anchors have to strike a chord with more than 100 million users religiously following live streaming platforms for video gaming.
JY from Beijing is a celebrity video gaming anchor. The 30-year-old man, known as "the lord of eSports," fell in love with video gaming in high school. He later sacrificed his college entrance exams to focus on becoming one of China's first professional video players… and he made it, eventually.

However, the beginning was not without road bumps. JY told Yangtze Evening Post that his income was around 500 to 800 yuan ($72-115) initially. The financial crisis in 2007 forced him to develop a second career as a video game anchor, which turned out to be a great success thanks to his gaming skills and popularity among online users, which he accumulated after six years of professional gaming.
The average online viewership of YJ's videos can reach 400,000. And today, JY makes a six-figure income annually.
"The money comes from the live streaming platforms I signed with, the Taobao store I run, gifts from fans, advertisements of video game developers implanted during live streaming, and my startups," he said.
"But few people can reach the top of the pyramid in this field. Most commentators don't even have an income," YJ added.

Popularity is a survival key. An anchor's worth essentially depends on the fans they have. But how to get users to follow at times competition is cutthroat?
Gaming techniques, talking styles, good looks and strong commitment are crucial.
Once one tick the right boxes, being the next Han Yiying, an eSport hostess who reportedly signed a three-year contract with live streaming platform Huya at 90 million yuan ($130,000) last year, won't be virtual reality.




Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, the most visited museum in the world each year, plans to stop selling paper tickets from its box office, perhaps by later this year.
Shan Jixiang, the museum's director, said an Internet-based system will be set up to better coordinate the number of visitors for different hours of the day.
The new plan is preliminarily scheduled to be launched in an "appropriate time after late October", but he said it still depends on whether conditions allow. Starting in July, the museum will gradually decrease the percentage of tickets available at physical box offices.
The Palace Museum opened its online ticket system in 2011, and its statistics show nearly half the tickets are sold via the internet. The tickets sold in the box office in the first quarter of 2017 decreased by about 10 percent from the same period a year earlier.
"As the public recognition for online tickets has kept rising in recent years, there is a foundation for our plan," Shan said.
The Palace Museum, China's former royal palace from 1420 to 1911 and also known as the Forbidden City, received more than 16 million visitors in 2016.
The museum set a daily quota of 80,000 visitors in 2015 due to safety concerns caused by overcrowding.
Shan said the change is another way to handle the crowds.
The current online booking system allows visitors to buy tickets only for the following days, but Shan said visitors now will be able to buy same-day tickets during the off-season, which is November to March.
Shan said the museum will work with online booking platforms and mobile apps, as well as digital payment channels such as Alipay and WeChat Wallet.
"For those people who are not familiar with online payments, we'll leave some windows of box office open to help them," he said.
Shan said its online payment system will have English and other language versions to assist foreign visitors.
Still, the change is not welcomed by all.
"It's unfair because not all Chinese people are netizens," said Mo Yao, 29, an office worker from Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, who recently visited the Palace Museum. She did say her shopping was heavily de-pendent on online payment. "At least, some tickets should be reserved for those preferring a traditional way of purchasing.
"And, if people come to Beijing and suddenly have a desire to admire the splendor of the Forbidden City, how will they feel if they are refused?"
A response given by the Palace Museum is that "staff will patiently explain for those who don't know the policy".
According to Pan Shou-yong, a museology professor at Minzu University of China, it is premature to map out the policy. His team once conducted research showing that about 80 percent of people going to the Palace Museum were first-time visitors.
He said that while some overseas counterparts, like the Louvre museum, also have online ticket systems, none use the system as the exclusive means to sell tickets.
"It's ok if paper tickets are no longer printed, but current studies don't endorse such a plan entirely depending on online booking," Pan said.
Jan Rinnert, chairman of Heraeus, a family-owned German company engaged in precious and special metals, sensors, specialty light sources, quartz glass and medical technology PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Led by Jan Rinnert, Germany's Heraeus expects China's initiative to spawn digital infrastructure
Overseeing a business as tough as precious metal recycling, thick film pastes and water decontamination, Jan Rinnert, chairman of German technology company Heraeus, has long recognized the importance of adding a human touch to his management philosophy.
It may have been derived from his earlier experience as a local government spokesperson, where he grasped the art of articulating a view, or, later, as a management consultant role in which he learned a slew of business best practices.
"I've always believed in the power in people. My father once told me never to look for a job, but to search for the right individual that you report to and learn from," he said.
Since taking the helm of the one of the most renowned family-run companies in Germany, Rinnert strives to become the "approachable" leader and role model for his 12,500 employees around the globe.
His frankness in leadership is exemplified by a number of initiatives to engage with staff, such as the "open space dialogue" where employees get to raise thorny questions from the outlook of the European Union to personal distractions.
"I was once asked by a Chinese colleague if our businesses would be dragged down by the gloomy outlook of the European Union following Brexit. That's when you realize they are absolutely the most valuable assets of the company," he said.
Founded in 1851 in Hanau, a city near Frankfurt, Heraeus may not be a household name, but it has a sizable presence globally by virtue of its business, which is providing materials and solutions to markets like environment, energy, health and transport. It also provides industrial applications from power electronics systems to electric vehicles, and engages in trading in precious metals such as platinum and gold.
Like many of its German peers, Heraeus is a "Hidden Champion"－a term coined by management consultant Hermann Simon to describe smaller companies that are among the top three of a niche market－with the only problem being it has grown a bit too big to be invisible now.
Sales in 2016 topped $20 billion with a satisfying level of margin, according to Rinnert, whose company does not disclose financial details and chooses to stay private.
"As a family(-run) company, we've never considered an initial public offering. Diversification remains a route to long-term growth. Under one roof, we aim to run eight hidden champions that are all independent, all leaders in their respective niche markets, while leveraging the company's synergies to grow along," he said.
That vision, in part, was made possible thanks to an overhaul plan led by Rinnert in 2014 to turn Heraeus into a portfolio company, by making business units more market-oriented and eliminating several levels of hierarchy.
Today, its portfolio ranges from components to coordinated material systems used in a wide variety of industries, including steel, electronics, chemical, automotive and telecommunications.
But this does not indicate an inward-looking business strategy. Its latest acquisition of Swiss precious metal processor Argor-Heraeus in April would help kick up a notch in processing capacity for gold and silver.
The buyout accords with an earlier investment in China, where Heraeus broke ground for a plant in Nanjing last year to boost capacity in recycling precious metals and manufacturing chemicals, to grow its local market share to 20 percent by 2020.
As the largest precious metals company in the world and one of the very few companies licensed to trade in precious metals in China, Heraeus has been present in the country for 40 years and generates 30 percent of its entire revenue from here.
In the eyes of Rinnert, the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) has laid a solid ground for Chinese companies to embark on technological breakthroughs and shed over-capacities through the supply-side structural reform, guidelines that are in line with what his company could offer.
"Retaining existing technology is not an option－that's the key learning from my family business. That's not easy because you are challenging the status quo. But automation, advanced manufacturing, and other things Chinese are doing is the way ahead to make businesses sustain," he said.
The Belt and Road Initiative will lend new momentum to growth, he said. "It's a visionary initiative. Today, it's more focused on physical infrastructure investment, with substantial financial systems in place such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as the cornerstone. In the future, we look forward to the digital and data infrastructure building where there is a larger role for us to play."
Rinnert further said the initiative would require extra efforts and coordination for public-private partnerships. It is a subject where Europe has experience and can share that with China.
But it is still the forthcoming cultural and people-to-people exchanges that matter the most, he said.
"I often recall my first startup company that hosted a number of DJs prior to college. That experience helped me deal with pressure, and know my strengths and limits. Today, I see the younger generation in China who are well-educated, digital-savvy and understand the complexity of the environment. I've a lot to expect from you."
Mainland authorities call for thorough probe, ask that fishermen be respected
Mainland authorities called on Taiwan to thoroughly investigate the shooting of fishermen by the Taiwan coast guard over the weekend, to avoid similar incidents in the future.
A fishing boat from Guangdong province was seized on Saturday morning by a Taiwan patrol boat in waters near Penghu county in southeastern Taiwan.
Two of its seven crew members were injured by rubber bullets fired from the patrol boat, Taiwan authorities said. They were sent to a hospital in Penghu for medical treatment, while the other five were detained.
An Fengshan, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, called on the Taiwan side late on Saturday to respect the fact that fishermen from both sides of the Taiwan Straits have long been fishing in the area.
"Similar cases in which Taiwan has seized a mainland fishing boat have occurred frequently in recent times," An said. "We have highlighted respect for the rights of mainland fishermen several times, but another incident occurred on Saturday morning."
Taiwan should stop seizing fishing boats without sound reason for doing so, he said.
"We requested the Taiwan side take the case seriously, release the fishermen and the boat as soon as possible and prevent the recurrence of similar cases in the future."
In March, another spokesman from the office, Ma Xiaoguang, commented on reports that Taiwan authorities had detained 20 mainland fishermen and their boat on charges of illegally trespassing in waters around the Dongsha Islands.
At that time, the office said: "Taiwan should respect fishermen from both sides of the Straits, including those from Hong Kong and Macao, stop its improper treatment of fishermen and protect their lives and property."
Ma voiced opposition to acts that undermine the basis of cross-Straits talks and hinder the development of cross-Straits ties.
The mainland has offered travel conveniences to Taiwan residents for several years.
At the end of 2016, the Civil Aviation Administration of China started upgrading self-service systems at mainland airports, in a move to make buying tickets and checking-in easier for Taiwan travelers.
More than 1,700 self-service facilities are planned across the country by the end of this year, the administration said.

Belt and Road has support of 100-plus countries, international organizations
When a train approached a freight railway station in Warsaw, Poland, on June 20, President Xi Jinping, who was making a state visit to the country, happily bit into a red apple, as did his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda.
The two leaders were attending a ceremony to mark the arrival of the first China-Europe Block Train, carrying Chinese-made products, including electronic components, to Warsaw. When the train returned to China, it was laden with Polish commodities, including produce, such as apples.
Boosting the interconnection of Asia and the rest of the world－the purpose of the China-Europe Block Train－is one of the goals of the China-proposed Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, collectively known as the Belt and Road Initiative.
The initiative, put forward by Xi in 2013, has become one of the most important public goods China offers the world and a key vehicle for Beijing to help improve global governance.
China has invested more than $50 billion in the programs related to the initiative and has won the support of over 100 countries and international organizations－more than 40 have signed cooperation agreements with China.
At least 28 heads of state and government will attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on May 14 and 15 in Beijing. The forum will be the highest-profile international meeting on the Belt and Road since the initiative was put forward.
Xi will attend the opening ceremony and host a roundtable leaders summit. The meeting is expected to translate the ambitious blueprint into solid progress and turn a new page on the initiative.
According to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the results of the forum will range from consensus-building to specific measures on implementation. China expects to sign agreements with about 20 countries and 20 international organizations at the event.
Launched by China, shared by the world
During his visit to Kazakhstan in September 2013, Xi proposed building the Silk Road Economic Belt to boost regional cooperation. A month later, in a speech to the Indonesian parliament, he put forward a proposal to jointly establish the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
With its guiding principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, the initiative has been defined by Xi as "a chorus of all countries along the routes, not only for China itself".
During his overseas trips in the past years, Xi repeatedly called on the countries－including in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America－to cooperate with China on the initiative.
"Instead of seeking any sphere of influence, China calls on all countries to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road," he said in a speech in January 2016 at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.
The past three years have witnessed the launch, expansion, faster-than-expected progress and fruitful outcomes of the Belt and Road Initiative.
According to the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, Chinese businesses have invested more than $50 billion in countries along the Belt and Road and have helped to build 56 economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 of those countries, generating nearly $1.1 billion in tax revenue and 180,000 local jobs.
"Through the Belt and Road Initiative, I want to share China's development opportunities with the countries along the routes and achieve joint prosperity," Xi said in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the business leader's forum of the G20 in September.
The Belt and Road Initiative has been widely recognized in the international community, showing that it is in accord with the will of the people, Xi said while visiting a port in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region last month.
Wang Yiwei, a professor at Renmin University of China's School of International Relations, said that since the launch of the initiative, China has been sharing its expertise in fields such as infrastructure construction and clean energy with countries and regions along the routes.
Though proposed by China, the initiative is an open, inclusive proposal and welcomes participation from all sides, he said.
Injecting impetus intoglobal economy
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation meets an increasingly urgent need for a new cooperation platform that brings countries together to pull the world out of the economic mire and inject fresh energy into interconnected development.
Last year, the world experienced the worst economic hardship since the global financial crisis, with a 13-percent drop in foreign direct investment and weak trade growth.
Chinese companies' investment in countries along the Belt and Road routes have resulted in a number of major projects, which contributed to those countries' economic growth, Xi said in January in his keynote speech at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland.
A series of major transportation, energy and communication projects, including the multipurpose road-rail Padma Bridge in Bangladesh, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and China Railway Express trains to Europe, have advanced over the past three years along with the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.
In November 2014, Xi announced that China will contribute $40 billion to set up the Silk Road Fund to boost infrastructure and resource development while improving industrial and financial cooperation along the centuries-old Silk Road trading routes.
In 2015, China set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to provide financing for infrastructure improvement in Asia. The AIIB has 70 members, so far, and its total lending fund amounts to over $2 billion.
China is pushing forward six economic corridors in the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative: the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, the China-Mongolia-Russia corridor, the China-Central Asia-West Asia corridor, the China-Indochina Peninsula corridor, the China-Pakistan corridor and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar corridor.
The six corridors form together a trade and transport network across Eurasia, laying a solid foundation for regional and trans-regional development plans.
Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, said the international community has higher expectations for China now, at a time when the global economic recovery lacks power.
"The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will hopefully help drive away the clouds of the economic doldrums and channel more positivity to global economic growth," he said.

LONDON — Arsene Wenger got the better of managerial rival Jose Mourinho for the first time in a competitive game as Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday to keep alive its Champions League qualification hopes.
Granit Xhaka, with a deflected shot, and former United player Danny Welbeck, with a bullet header, scored goals in a four-minute span early in the second half to end United's 25-match unbeaten in the league dating to October.
This was the 16th competitive head to head between Wenger and Mourinho — and the 13th in league play — since 2004. It has been a one-sided rivalry but Wenger finally got a victory over the man who once dubbed him a "specialist in failure," for a result that might end United's chances of a top-four finish and leaves Arsenal with some hope.
"Finally, I leave this (Emirates) stadium with Arsenal fans happy," Mourinho said. "It's the first time I see them smile, enjoy."Arsenal moved two points behind fifth-place United with a game in hand, and is seven points behind third-placed Liverpool having played two games fewer and six behind fourth-placed Manchester City having played one game fewer. Wenger's team has four matches remaining to earn a 20th straight season in the Champions League.
"We still have a mathematical chance but we need some help," Wenger said. "But the best help we can get is by winning our own games."A disappointing game burst into life in the 54th when Xhaka, afforded plenty of space in central midfield following a throw-in, advanced and sent in a 30-meter (yard) shot that struck the turned back of Ander Herrera and looped over goalkeeper David de Gea.
Welbeck, who was sold to Arsenal in 2014 to end a 13-year association with United, has now scored in each of his last three appearances against his old club after powering a header in off the bar in the 57th from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross.
Mourinho made eight changes to his starting team from the 1-0 win over Celta Vigo in the first leg of the Europa League semifinals on Thursday. The second leg is at Old Trafford on Thursday and Mourinho has suggested the European competition, which offers a place in the Champions League for the winner, is his priority for the remainder of the season.
"Of course, we knew we were not coming in our maximum power," Mourinho said. "Thursday is the match of the season."It meant the 19-year-old Axel Tuanzebe was handed his Premier League debut, at right back up against Alexis Sanchez, and he performed excellently. Scott McTominay, a 20-year-old midfielder, came on as a second-half substitute for his first-team debut while Paul Pogba — the world's most expensive player — didn't even come off the bench.
United hasn't scored away to a top-six rival all season.
Arsenal will climb above United with a win at Southampton on Wednesday.

MADRID — Maria Sharapova is not yet worried about whether she will be awarded a wild card for Wimbledon following her doping ban.
After moving into the second round of the Madrid Open on Sunday, Sharapova said it's too early to think about the July tournament.
"I mean, look, I would love to be in a position to compete in that event," she said.
"It's very meaningful to me. But it's just too far down the line right now."Sharapova defeated Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Croatia in three sets for her fourth victory since serving a 15-month ban for testing positive for meldonium at last year's Australian Open. She was eliminated in the semifinals in Stuttgart last month in her first tournament since the ban.
"I feel like I'm like a broken-record player, but these tournaments are really important," Sharapova said. "The match play that I have, getting myself in these situations, getting out of them, will ultimately help me for those big events whether I'm in there or not."Sharapova, who is also expected to play in Rome later this month, has been playing on wild-card entries because she lost her ranking following the doping suspension.
The decision on her wild card for Wimbledon may not come until June 20, according to tournament officials. The five-time Grand Slam champion and former top-ranked player will know on May 16 if she will be able to compete on a wild card in the French Open, which starts May 22.
A win in the second round in Madrid against Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, one of the most outspoken players against Sharapova's return to tennis, could be enough to let the Russian qualify for Wimbledon on points, without needing a wild card.
Bouchard, who called Sharapova "a cheater" and said she should be banned for life from tennis, was a finalist in Wimbledon in 2014. Sharapova won the 2004 title in Wimbledon.
Sharapova said playing as many matches as possible is the most important thing for her at the moment.
"I feel like it's still a learning experience, and it's still just getting back in the groove and understanding what I need to work on and improve," she said. "But those are all things that are normal and are part of the process, part of kind of the journey that I've started.
"You can train for as much as you want, but playing the matches and being in that competitive environment is just not the same. You can never replicate it," she said.
"Expectations of how I play, I'll get back into that. But, as I said, the match play is the most important thing right now."Sharapova said she is not being affected by the off-the-court controversy involving her return to tennis.
"I'm very much in my element. I think it's always great to be the person that's kind of in control of your actions while everything around you is moving in a different way," she said. "Not much has changed from my end. I still go through my routines. I still go through my training. I'm around my team. But then there's a little bit more around. I definitely feel it, but it doesn't change anything that I do.
"I'm kind of the driver of that," she said. "I like being in that position. I like doing my work. I love being quiet about it and letting everyone around speak or have the noise, whatever it is."

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.

The cost of living in Asian cities generally increased last year, with Singapore remaining at the top for the fourth consecutive year. But exchange rate volatility and resurgent commodity prices, rather than productivity gains, were responsible for the increase.
Asia remains the most diverse region in terms of the cost of living. Ironically, with several major agricultural and manufacturing product exporters, East Asian cities tend to be the world's priciest places for tradable products, such as general grocery and clothing.
Asian cities continue to climb up the world cost of living ladder, accounting for half of the 10 most expensive cities in the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Exchange rate volatility was the major factor that determined the cost of living in cities. With the strength of the US dollar moderating and the euro remaining relatively stable, currencies such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar have gained in value, ending up with higher relative cost. Underpinned by a stronger yen, Tokyo and Osaka have returned to the 10 most expensive cities' list, by climbing up seven and nine places. And Seoul, supported by currency and income growth, has moved up two places to the 6th spot.
The steady depreciation of the yuan and weaker consumer sentiment have dragged down living costs in China. Five Chinese mainland cities－Beijing, Suzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Dalian－are among the biggest movers down the ranking ladder in the past year. Shanghai remains the most expensive city in the Chinese mainland, though its relative costs are lower. The city is 8 percent cheaper than New York City now compared with just 3 percent 12 months ago. The city used to be as expensive as Tokyo, but is now cheaper than not only Tokyo and Osaka but also Sydney and Melbourne.
Asian cities' rankings are characterized by extremes, the most expensive and the cheapest. Singapore and Hong Kong continue to be the most and second-most expensive cities, while cities such as Colombo, Kathmandu, New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karachi and Bangalore represent the best value for money in Asia and are among the 30 cheapest in the world because of lower incomes and closer links to domestic agriculture and manufacturing supply chains.
A closer look at the most expensive cities shows Asian cities tend to form the priciest locations for tradable goods, such as grocery and daily necessities. Yet they offer non-tradable goods at much lower prices than European cities. This perhaps reflects a greater premium on discretionary spending for better quality products, such as organic food, branded clothes and advanced electronic products, in high-income cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo. The grocery products many Asian countries, such as China and Malaysia, export often do not match the demand for wealthier Asian countries' premium consumption.
Government subsidy is another important factor that decides Asian cities' ranks. Grocery prices in cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea, for instance, are among the highest in the world.
In Seoul, topping up a grocery basket is almost 50 percent more expensive than in New York City. The average price of a 1-kilogram loaf of bread in Seoul is 140 percent more than in New Delhi, and much higher than in China, Malaysia, New Zealand, which export agricultural products. Due to limited domestic arable land, the ROK relies on imports of agricultural products, but with high tariffs to protect its domestic agricultural industry, it ends up with very high grocery prices. In India, one sees the opposite trend. To reduce hunger, India provides subsidies for staple foods and other agricultural products, lowering the cost of foods.
In the long run, this divergence is likely to persist and Asian cities are expected to become relatively more expensive as emerging economies continue to supply much of the world's wage and demand growth. But the capacity for economic shocks and currency swings could make the ride quite bumpy.

WeChat Pay advertisements hang from the ceiling at a supermarket in East China's Hangzhou city. LONG WEI/CHINA DAILY
WeChat is already one of China's most popular mobile payment methods. Now the social media app, owned by Internet giant Tencent, is teaming up with Silicon mobile payment startup Citcon to take its services to the US market.
Through WeChat accounts, users will be able to pay for whatever they need in Chinese currency renminbi without cash, just as they do in China.
For four consecutive years, China has been the world number one outbound tourism country, accounting for over 13 percent of the total tourism revenue globally. The United States has been one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travelers.
"Last year, over 100 million Chinese people traveled outside of China. Once they see this place can accept WeChat Pay, they can use their mobile phones. They certainly receive much warmer welcomes‍ from foreign countries," according to Chuck Huang, CEO of Citcon.
Mobile payment is the new frontier of commerce, and China is leading this trend. By providing an easy-to-use mobile payment and cross-border marketing solution, WeChat is empowering global merchants to connect with millions of Chinese consumers.
Currently, WeChat Pay is available in 15 countries and regions, for payments in 12 foreign currencies.
Tencent has now joined Apple and Google-parent Alphabet in the ranks of the world's biggest firms by market capitalization, with a value of more than 302 billion US dollars. Shares in the tech company hit a record high on Tuesday.
It's the only firm outside the US among the world's top 10 most valuable companies.‍

Even though the Republic of Korea's presidential election is just one day away, the candidates are still debating security matters rather than economic recovery and employment, because the winner will have the tough job of dealing with the security jigsaw on the Korean Peninsula.




The US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, according to claims, is operational to a large extent. And the likelihood of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducting its sixth nuclear test remains high as the United States threatens to relinquish "strategic patience".
Seoul needs deft diplomatic maneuverings, not some "defensive" weapons, to safeguard national security. The ROK's economic prospects don't look good either. The reform proposed by impeached and ousted president Park Geun-hye did little to break the plutocracy, which is still thwarting economic growth. In other words, the paradox that a government requires enough votes as well as financial support to run a country might keep haunting the new ROK administration.
The ROK presidential election is being held not only prematurely but also amid fears that a regional conflict could break out at any moment. That THAAD may be combat ready very soon will leave the new ROK president little room to take immediate strategic decisions. In fact, Moon Jae-in of the Minjoo Party, the frontrunner in the presidential race had stressed that the final decision on THAAD should be left to the next government.
The Park administration's decision that THAAD can better counter the threat from Pyongyang (and the interim administration's ratification of the move) will make it difficult for the new ROK president to take a different course on national security.
Instead of testing its ballistic missiles, Pyongyang held its "largest ever live artillery drill" on April 25 to mark the 85th anniversary of the founding of its army. That said, Seoul will be simplifying the complex security and diplomatic issues if it places its faith in THAAD and its military alliance with Washington for safeguarding its national security.
The paramount security risk facing the ROK is the DPRK's nuclear program, whose longevity has a lot to do with the mixed defense structure in Northeast Asia. Rather than working closely with China, an important party to the global denuclearization efforts, the ROK chose to depend on its military alliance with the US and Japan for its national security.
US President Donald Trump has said that he wants a diplomatic resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue despite warning of a "major, major" conflict with the DPRK. In this context, the ROK could help resolve the disputes surrounding the DPRK nuclear issue.
Peaceful handling of the nuclear issue is at the core of the interests of both Seoul and Beijing, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry has reiterated China's strong opposition to the DPRK's nuclear and missile tests.
The new ROK president may have an unenviable job on hand, with the country's security and diplomatic situation approaching a turning point. There is hope, though, because strategic patience and delicate maneuverings have not yet exhausted. In this regard, concerted efforts to resume the Kaesong Industrial Complex in the DPRK's border town, restart the tours to the DPRK's Mount Kumgang resort, and recalibrate China-ROK relations would be more than worth the trouble.

The ancient music of the Hani people faces decline, Chen Nan reports in Yuanyang county, Yunnan province.
He sits alone on a bench in the sun, surrounded by people, most of whom are tourists.
This is Zhu Xiaohe, a 79-year-old man from the Hani ethnic group, who lives in the village of Dongpu in Southwest China's Yunnan province.
The village is located in Yuanyang county, in the Honghe Hani and Yi autonomous prefecture of Yunnan.
In 2007, he became the first in his ethnic group to be recognized as an inheritor of this form of intangible culture.
He sings ancient Hani songs, or haba.
The United States is Chinese tourists' top destination for road trips overseas. PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Chinese are increasingly preferring road trips overseas as the preferred way to travel and soak in sights and cultures. The United States remains their top destination with Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco being particularly popular.
The US is followed by New Zealand, Germany, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, in terms of popularity, according to a recent report Tuniu Corp, an online travel agency based in Nanjing.
Besides, the United Arab of Emirates, Belgium and France are growing in popularity as Chinese driving licenses are valid there.
The top five cities where self-driving outbound Chinese tourists come from are Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing. These cities have more than two million car owners, making them more likely to travel in their own vehicles in China and in rented cars abroad.
Currently, there are more than 360 million car drivers in China, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
"The growth of holidays marked by car drives is frequently associated with wealth, freedom, and choice, and a growing middle-class in China," said Alex Yan, COO of Tuniu Corp.
"Meanwhile, we found that Chinese road trippers prefer to stay at nicer hotels, but not motels near the roads. More than 80 percent of the them usually stay at four-star or five-star hotels."
The majority of tourists who prefer self-driving trips are aged between 21 and 40, with those aged between 31 and 40 dominating this group. Most of them are affluent and tend to pursue unique trip experiences. Besides, many of them have young children and road trips fulfil their demand for travel with kids.
Lily Min, 26, an office worker in Beijing, said she and her boyfriend last year traveled to Hawaii, where they rented a red convertible.
"Hawaii is large and it's inconvenient to travel around if you don't rent a car or travel with a group. It feels really cool to drive by ourselves, as we have greater control over our time. And it's not expensive to rent a car－it costs less than $100 per day," she said.
Overseas road trips tend to take longer than an average trip. About half of these trips last year lasted 11 to15 days.
Domestic road trips are also proving to be popular. Among the well-received weekend getaways are Zhuhai and Guangzhou in Guangdong province, and Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
Longer domestic road trips to Tibet, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are also popular among Chinese tourists. About half of the domestic road trips last six to 10 days.




A LAWYER IN GUANGZHOU, South China's Guangdong province, is suing a local expressway company after he was charged 10 yuan ($1.4) for using a highway designed to link non-adjacent towns to an expressway, which he claims he did not use. Legal Daily commented on Saturday:
The linking lanes usually have a tollgate on one end and a non-adjacent town on the other. In some cases, drivers who reach the tollgate from other lanes rather than tolled highway are still charged the extra fee. The Guangzhou lawyer is not alone in questioning whether a driver should pay for the highway linking to an expressway if he or she does not use it.
Expressway companies argue that they have the right to charge such a fee to cover the construction and maintenance costs of these lanes. While many drivers refuse to buy such an explanation because they believe that the pre-express lanes are not expressways and hence any such charges, which can be more expensive than toll fees, are illegitimate.
Of all the controversies surrounding the case, one thing is clear: Drivers should not be charged for a service they do not use. What the Guangzhou expressway company has done does not hold any legal water, despite the fact that it assumes that any driver arriving at the tollgate has used the highway providing access to the expressway.
It is unlikely that the local transportation authorities permit drivers to be charged a fee when they do not use roads that link to expressways, and even if they do, such a decision is still subject to relevant laws such as the Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests and the regulations on toll roads. If the toll authorization is misinterpreted, whether on purpose or not, the expressway company should at least explain why it did so and on what grounds it justifies charging all drivers indiscriminately.
The rapid expansion of expressway network in China is praiseworthy, but it also has caused problems. In addition to charging fees fairly and legally, local transportation officials should launch a thorough review of their road management to protect the legitimate interests of drivers.
Traditional Chinese medicine originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners use herbal medicines and various mind and body practices, such as acupuncture and Tai chi, to treat or prevent health problems.[Photo/Xinhua]
"It can hurt a little, but the pain does not stay, it takes maybe a few seconds then it goes away," Donnersmarck told Xinhua on Friday at an acupuncture clinic.
As a recognized authority on Traditional Chinese medicine with a degree in Western medicine, Dr. Wu has been practicing in Santa Monica for 27 years.
Donnersmarck admitted that it was scary when he saw the acupuncture needles for the first time. "Acupuncture is a very precise, careful and caring process... the doctor can not miss by a few millimeters," he told Xinhua, "With Dr. Wu, you feel so much the deep wisdom, the experience, the knowledge. I feel it so much and I trust him."
His trust paid him back. Without any surgery, Donnersmarck's problem was solved in one month. "I found that Western medicine can be very aggressive, and it has extreme side effects," Donnersmarck said. "But for Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, they do not have side effects, it is about activating the energy and oxygen flow in the body, it is about helping the body heal itself."
Another thing that Donnersmarck found impressive was how Dr. Wu takes Western medicine into consideration and uses that in Traditional Chinese medicine.

The company has introduced several pilot lockers with basketballs at the city's public and campus courts. Users can borrow and return a basketball through the company's WeChat account after paying a 29-yuan ($4.2) deposit. One basketball costs 1.5 yuan for half an hour.
The lockers are equipped with a camera to ensure the process is completed properly. According to the company, the lockers can also hold personal items for users.
A photo of the lockers was posted online by a Weibo user, China's version of Twitter, which intrigued many netizens.
"It's indeed troublesome to bring a basketball oneself. With the service, you can rent a ball near the court when you want to play and return it afterwards and don't need to be burdened by anything if you want to go somewhere else," Weibo user xiaohaierhaipi wrote.
A company staff member said the pilot project is going well in Jiaxing and the service will soon be expanded to other cities nationwide.

President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Emmanuel Macron on Monday for winning the French presidential election.
Mentioning that France was the first western power to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Xi said that China-France relations have strategic significance and international influence, which have seen healthy and stable development in previous years.
In the message, Xi pointed out that as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and powers with great global influence, China and France have important duties in world peace and development.
The continuous development of China-France relations would not only benefit the people of both countries, but also contribute to global peace, stability and prosperity, he said.
China is willing to make joint efforts with France to enhance the development of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level.

Centrist Macron wins French presidential election
Emmanuel Macron will be the next president of France after decisively defeating Marine Le Pen in Sunday's second-round run-off, according to early polling issued after voting closed at 8 pm local time.
Le Pen phoned Macron to congratulate him, and he was also called by Theresa May, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and received a message from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The centrist Macron is predicted to win 65.5 percent of the vote to right-winger Le Pen's 34.45 percent. The result shows that Macron did better than previous opinion polls suggested and that Le Pen's support deteriorated during the last two weeks.
As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.
A Chinese lawyer on trial for subversion has denied claims he was tortured while in police detention.
Xie Yang, of Hunan province, is accused of subversion and "disrupting court order", a charge similar to contempt of court.
At a hearing at Changsha Intermediate People's Court on Monday morning, the 45-year-old said the police and prosecutors had adequately protected his legal rights.
He said the authorities did not use torture to force a confession, adding that he has "not suffered torture", according to footage of the trial released on Sina Weibo.
The court also posted a transcript of the hearing online.
Police placed Xie under investigation in July 2015 and arrested him on Jan 8 last year, according to prosecutors.
The trial was attended by more than 40 people, including Xie's relatives and attorneys, legislators and political advisers.
The hearing was also open to journalists from foreign and domestic media organizations.

BEIJING - China's foreign trade surplus widened in April as import growth decline outpaced that of exports, customs data showed Monday.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.3 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan ($179.8 billion), down from the 22.3-percent increase in March.
Imports expanded 18.6 percent to 979.1 billion yuan, compared with a 26.3-percent increase a month ago.
That leaves a trade surplus of 262.3 billion yuan, up 0.6 percent year on year. The surplus widened from 164.3 billion yuan seen in March.
In the first four months, total trade volume added up to 8.42 trillion yuan, up 20.3 percent year on year.
While the April trade growth fell short of expectations, customs data reflected improved trade structure.
In the first four months, general trade expanded 21.6 percent year on year to 4.75 trillion yuan, accounting for 56.5 percent of the total trade volume.
Trade of private enterprises grew 21.7 percent to 3.17 trillion yuan in the first four months, accounting for 37.6 percent of the total, and 0.4 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
Despite rising protectionism and anti-globalization sentiment, China's imports and exports with major trade partners remained strong.
During the first four months, trade with the European Union gained 15.5 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan, accounting for 14.8 percent of the total. Trade with the United States expanded 20.3 percent to 1.18 trillion yuan, making it China's second largest trade partner.
Customs data also showed that a leading indicator for China's exports rebounded from 40.2 to 40.7 month on month in April, signalling positive potential in exports.

Sunday's convincing win for Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential elections provides the EU with an opportunity to shake off its populist blues and move forward with a new unity of purpose. The Macron win was important because he was by far the most pro-EU candidate arguing that what France needed was more European integration, not less. It is no surprise that his victory was especially welcomed in Brussels.
The re-launch of the European project will not be possible before the German elections in September. But it matters little whether Angela Merkel or Martin Schulz is elected as both are solid pro-European centrist politicians. In the intervening five months you can expect a flurry of activity between Berlin, Brussels and Paris as politicians and officials work out how best to re-launch the EU that has been floating aimlessly for the past couple of years.
The reasons for the EU's malaise were the triple shock of the Greek financial crisis, the rise of populism and Brexit. The Greek crisis has been contained and the government in Athens has been granted further loans by the IMF and the EU. The fact that the European economy is showing signs of renewed growth has helped open the coffers.
The defeat of Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands is a good sign that populism has peaked and is now falling. The rise of populist parties was closely linked to the refugee crisis but this is now under control and their support is dropping. The EU has also pushed back against the policies of some populist governments (Poland and Hungary) which demonstrate that Brussels is still prepared to defend the core values of the EU.
Brexit was of course linked to the populist movement. "Take back control" was an appealing if meaningless slogan that helped the Brexiteers to victory in June 2016. The British vote was a huge shock to the political elites in Europe and occasioned much soul-searching. But oddly it has pushed the 27 member states closer together and reinforced their desire to strengthen the EU. At a succession of meetings in Bratislava, Rome and Brussels the 27 have shown a steely determination to stay united and negotiate Brexit as one. Brexit is a classic lose-lose situation but the UK may be a bigger loser than the EU.
This new confidence in the EU can be seen from its determination to stand up, with China, in support of globalisation and the multilateral system. Worried at the noises coming from the US Donald Trump administration, the EU has reinforced its determination to uphold the Paris climate change agreement and forge ahead with free trade agreements.
Brussels welcomed President Xi Jinping's Davos speech defending the fruits of globalisation. The EU now looks forward to the EU-China summit this year as an opportunity to further deepen relations. It hopes to give a push to the negotiations for a bilateral investment agreement which are viewed as a precursor to an eventual FTA. China also recognises the growing importance of the EU not only as a major market for its goods but also as a strong pillar of the multilateral system. The recent strategic dialogue meeting in Beijing between EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini and State Councillor Yang Jiechi revealed a broad consensus on many global issues.
The EU is also a strong supporter of the Belt and Road Initiative. The over-arching principle of connectivity is a concept shared by the EU and China. Both sides are already working on a number of major infrastructure projects and more will be discussed at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. Several European countries have joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank while China has joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which improves mutual understanding and transparency.
The Belt and Road Forum is an important sign of China's on-going commitment to a more global and connected world. In this endeavour the EU is a natural partner.

SOFIA－Chinese and Bulgarian officials in the Bulgarian capital on April 28 voiced hopes to boost tourism cooperation, promising to make full use of the countries' unique resources.
At the opening of the conference of the "EU-China Tourism Year 2018: New Investment Opportunities for the Tourism Sector in Bulgaria", China's ambassador to Bulgaria Zhang Haizhou said: "Today's seminar reflects the strong desire of the Bulgarian side to tap its potential, improve its services and expand its market in tourism so as to attract more Chinese tourists."
He says Bulgaria "has rich, unique tourism resources, and the Bulgarian government attaches great importance to the development of the tourism industry".
Traveling to China will bring huge profits to Bulgarian tourism enterprises, he says.
"The Chinese side sincerely welcomes more Bulgarian friends to China."
Too much salt may be causing excessive urination at night, scientists believe. Provided To China Daily
THE SHENYING SALT COMPANY in Pingdingshan, Central China's Henan province, is recalling its rock salt products, which customers in several provinces have complained give off the odor of smelly feet when heated. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Friday:




Although the company has recalled over 7,000 tons of its salt products and further production has been halted, there are questions unanswered: Are the salt products really "harmless" as claimed, and how did the provincial salt management bureau came to that conclusion?
Questioned about the cause of the bad smell in March, the Henan company blamed butyric acid, a harmless chemical often found in goat's milk. While an inspection by the Henan provincial salt management bureau found that the salt did not conform to national standards, it said the bad smell is caused by several chemicals that are not harmful to humans.
But the salt quality supervision and inspection station of Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu province, tested the stinky salt earlier and found nitrite traces, which are far from harmless. The investigation authorities in Tai'an, East China's Shandong province, also found hydrogen sulfide in the samples. These results warrant tests by a more authoritative third-party organization.
Why did it take the Henan authorities so long to disclose their test results is also a question worth asking. The complaints about the smelly salt were first exposed about two months ago, so too were the Nanjing and Tai'an tests, but the Henan provincial salt management bureau did not respond until the public outcry for "a proper explanation" became too loud to ignore in the past few days.
More important, it seems that those behind the scandal are yet to be held accountable. On the one hand, the substandard salt may pose a threat to public health. On the other hand, the company said in earlier reports that its products are sent to a third-party organization for quality tests every quarter. It is inconceivable that these testers did not notice the odor that was detectable even by human noses.

Beijing's largest burger festival is back with a Wild West twist this year.
The Beijinger 2017 Burger Cup is taking inspiration from the rootin' tootin' American West for a burger festival packed with performances, games, and of course, burgers sure to satisfy even the pickiest of cowboys.
A stellar selection of burger vendors are set up for this year's event. Expect a mix of local favorites as well as newcomers to taste test. To accompany the juicy bites, more than 20 brews, both local and imported, will be available to keep tasters refreshed.
What is a festival without some background music? Expect a lineup of some of Beijing's wildest bands, DJs and entertainers playing everything from country to rock. Consider it a perfect opportunity to dance off some calories from all those burgers.
It wouldn't be a themed event without costumes, so dress in your best cowboy and cowgirl getup. Prizes will be awarded to the best dressed. And for the little ones, there is a special kids' area and plenty of games and activities to keep them busy while parents enjoy their burgers. There is also a Wild West costume contest for kids.
Last year's festival saw nearly 5,000 guests sample burgers, beers and other bites from over 30 vendors while enjoying entertainment from some of Beijing's best bands and performers, including Stevie Mac and The Mac Daddies and Moonglow Burlesque.

MADRID — While Rafael Nadal continues to thrive, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray are just trying to get back in form.
The top-ranked Murray and the second-ranked Djokovic arrive for the Madrid Open looking to regain their confidence after lackluster starts to their seasons, hoping to find their best game in time for the French Open later this month.
Nadal has won two straight titles on clay, while Murray and Djokovic have struggled on the surface so far.
For defending Madrid Open champion Djokovic, the tournament in Spain will also give him a chance to test his game after parting ways with longtime coach Marian Vajda last week.
"When you start losing more matches, you start questioning your game, yourself, what you're doing wrong so you can rectify that and get better, turn the tables around," Djokovic said Sunday. "I've been very fortunate to experience the upwards direction of my career ever since I've started. This is now a different direction a little bit. In the last six months, I haven't had too many of great results. That's why, you know, I've felt like I needed some changes and I needed to approach things maybe a little bit differently."
Djokovic won in Doha to start the year but never made it past the quarterfinals in the following four tournaments he played. Among his losses was a second-round defeat to Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin in the Australian Open. He lost to Australia's Nick Kyrgios in the quarterfinals in Acapulco and in the Round of 16 in Indian Wells. In his first clay-court tournament of the year, Djokovic was eliminated by David Goffin in the quarterfinals.
"I've played so many years on this level that I'm feeling comfortable on the tennis court regardless of these current changes," he said. "Generally, I mean, I haven't forgotten to hit the tennis ball. I've continued on more or less with the same kind of routine and approach that I've had over the years, you know, with certain changes."Murray, the runner-up to Djokovic in Madrid in 2016, also lost to the Serbian in the final in Doha earlier this year.
Murray won in Dubai, but started the clay season trying to regain his form following a right elbow injury that kept him out of the Miami Open and the Davis Cup quarterfinals.
He lost to Albert Ramos-Vinolas in the third round in Monte Carlo after blowing a 4-0 lead in the deciding set, then was eliminated by Dominic Thiem in the semifinals of the Barcelona Open.
"At the beginning of the clay season, it's always a bit trickier for me than the other surfaces just because the movement isn't as natural on this surface for me as it is on the hard courts and the grass courts," Murray said. "It takes me time. I need to work on that each year when I come back onto it a lot before I feel comfortable doing it."He said he remained optimistic for Madrid and the run-up to Roland Garros despite the disappointing result recently.
"Expectations are high. I want to do well the next few weeks," Murray said. "In many ways, it's the most important part of the year. There's a lot of big tournaments that come very quickly, one after the other. I'm motivated. The last couple of years, once I've got that part of my game right, then I feel like clay does actually suit my game well."Murray and Djokovic will likely have to get past a resurging Nadal if they are to win in Madrid.
Nadal won in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, playing well in each tournament. He has won 10 consecutive matches and is 21-1 in his past 22 sets.
Next month, the fifth-ranked Spaniard will try to win a 10th French Open title. The last of his 14 Grand Slams was three years ago at Roland Garros.

Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.

Grandmothers play important roles for many Chinese. Unlike in the West, many of them live and grow up in a family of three to four generations.
Ni Ping, actress and one of the country's best-known TV anchors who hosted the CCTV Spring Festival Gala 12 times, establishes herself as a sincere, congenial, and empathic speaker, whose plain and full-of-life words have the power to move people to tears.
"I get that from my grandma," Ni says.
She has recorded her grandmother's quotations and memories of living with her for 50 years in a book. The book gets popular and its newest edition, published last month, invites young readers to ponder on family tradition as well as ways to return love and care to the elderly.
Ni had a difficult time when her son was found ill shortly after birth, and she had to stop working to get him treatment. It was in 1999, when her hosting career was at its peak. She was upset and began to smoke cigarettes.
It was her grandma who calmed her, and encouraged her with colloquial and simple words: "If you're not beaten, everything can be settled; if you give up and let yourself fall, nobody could help you to stand up. If you are not the one to save your kid, nobody can. Grandma believes you can."
Rail freight services linking Chinese cities with destinations across Eurasia seen as critical to boosting trade and economic ties
The trees and plants exported by Sichuan Heshengde Import and Export Trade Co used to spend up to 35 days in transit before they reached their destination markets in Europe.
After being loaded onto a truck at the company's base in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, the plants were driven to Xiamen Port on the southeast coast and transferred to a ship, which crossed the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea before docking in Europe.
Things changed in December, however, when the company switched to using a China Railway Express freight service that travels between Chengdu and the Dutch city of Tilburg in just 13 days.
"It's not only cut the travel time, but also wastage," said Gao Yunfei, assistant to Heshengde's general manager. "The rail journey has increased the survival rate of our plants by 10 percent compared with the previous shipping method.
"The plants also look much better, which means they can be sold at a higher price," he added.
To date, the company has shipped nine containers loaded with money tree plants, Chinese banyan or white willow on the freight service. Most containers are about 12 meters by 2 meters by 2 meters.
Gao said about half of Heshengde's exports now travel by train. "The price is higher, but considering the time and reduced wastage, the cost is about the same as by sea," he said. "It depends on our customers' requirements, but as the supplier, we prefer rail."
The CR Express network is helping companies throughout China and neighboring countries to improve their trade with markets in Central Asia and Europe.
China launched its first cross-border rail freight service - between Chongqing and Duisburg in Germany - in March 2011. Since then, the number has risen to 51, connecting 27 Chinese cities with 28 destinations in 11 countries.
Some 3,557 outbound and inbound journeys had been made on these routes, and that figure is expected hit 5,000 by 2020, according to a five-year development plan for the CR Express released in October by the National Development and Reform Commission.
Seventeen Chinese cities have regular scheduled services, with the busiest being Chengdu, where 10 trains depart every week. The other 10 offer chartered services.
The shortest run is between Chengdu and Lodz in Poland, which takes 12 days, while the longest starts in Yiwu in Zhejiang and ends in Madrid, covering 13,052 km in 18 days.
CR Express services utilize three key border ports: Manzhouli in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, the eastern gateway; Erenhot in Inner Mongolia, the central gateway; and Alashankou and Khorgos in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, which form the western gateway.
As a logistical option, rail freight is faster than by sea and cheaper than by air, according to the network operator, China Railway Corp, which says almost all services arrive on time. Prices are not publicly disclosed.
Plan to rebrand
China's first cross-border freight services were launched by local railway authorities, with a route's name usually made up of the departure city, the border port and the destination: Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe, for example.
Last year, the NDRC rebranded all services as CR Express as part of its development plan, which highlighted the rail links as crucial to the Belt and Road Initiative.
First proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, the initiative comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and aims to boost trade and investment between China, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
Logistics services are seen as a physical link connecting Eurasia that could prove the cornerstone for strengthening economic ties. However, the development plan states that better regulation is urgently needed to deal with the high costs, disorderly competition, inefficient customs clearance, and unsuitable infrastructure.
The plan sets a target to have three gateways and 43 transit hubs as part of the CR Express network by 2020.
Jorge Luis Borges' poetry is usually considered profound and thought-provoking. But an upcoming Chinese TV series will make an effort to bring out the Argentine poet's romantic works.
The poem, written in 1934, is used by his character, a lonely entrepreneur, to win the heart of his true love.
The series will be aired on Beijing Satellite TV and the streaming site PPTV on May 11.
The cast includes mainland actress Pan Zhilin and Taiwan actresses Cherrie Ying and Elaine Jin.

'Ode to Joy 2' to hit the small screen in May
Over 500 artists from 22 countries will attend the annual cultural event this year. It runs through May 31.
The play will be staged at Tsinghua University on May 20 and 21.
Directed by Kirill Glushajev and performed by the actors and actresses of the State Small Theatre of Vilnius, the play tells the story of Vassa Zheleznova, a woman whose alcoholic husband assaults her and does not do enough for their son while alive. She works in a factory for years and raises her son but eventually she and her son clash.
"The conflicts between materialism and spirituality, and between sociability and individualism have been presented well in The Mother. We may see it as a Lithuanian story but at the same time it's recognizable in every society," says Glushajev.
"I am more interested in the conflict between humans as individuals, especially in a family, rather than between different societies or ideologies," the 33-year-old director adds.
Lithuanian actress Egle Gabrenaite, who leads the cast as the mother in the play, has done more than 60 stage roles.
TOKYO - By day, Sumiko Iwamuro runs a Chinese restaurant, where she has worked for six decades making "gyoza" dumplings, while by night, she spins records at Tokyo clubs under the moniker DJ Sumirock.
But the juggling of long days and frenzied nights is not the most inspiring thing about Iwamuro.
She is also 82 years old.
Japan is known for its ageing demographic, with people aged 65 and above making up 26.6 percent of the population in 2015.
A prime example of an active senior, Iwamuro plays to crowds mostly 60 years younger than she is at the DecaBarZ nightclub in the heart of Tokyo's Shinjuku district.
Taking up the turntables in her 70s, Iwamuro then spent a year learning the tricks of the trade at a school for disc jockeys.
Once on the dance floor, she stole the hearts of club-goers.
"She's got this energy that goes beyond age, and that can equal any young person's here," said 25-year-old clubber Fuminari Fujii.
Iwamuro says her sound is fundamentally techno music with jazz, French chanson and classical music mixed in.
Ever curious and never one to give up her dreams, she hopes one day to debut on the New York club scene.
"When I spin the tables, I just want to match the beat, choose the right music", she said, when asked what kept her practising her tunes and returning to spin records.
"But the best thing is for my audience to enjoy themselves."

The villagers he led only had hand tools－and explosives. He's the stuff of legend－but real. Huang Dafa is arguably an actual, modern incarnation of the ancient myth of Yu Gong.
The saying yu gong yi shan－or "the old man moves mountains"－is a parable of persistence that seems foolhardy in the face of unimaginable odds.
Fable says two peaks separated Yu Gong's home from the village.
So, he decided to dig them away.
Another elderly man mocked him. Yu Gong responded that while his descendants could dig for generations, the mountains wouldn't grow any higher.
The gods were so moved by his determination that they moved the mountains for him.
Huang enjoyed no such divine intervention.
He had to rely on pure will.
With the theme of "People Aspire to Lasting Peace and Sustainable Development", the Commemoration is jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, The United Nations System in China and The People's Government of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
Eda Satsuki, Japan's Former President of the House of Councillors, told China Daily the United Nations decided on the goal of sustainable development, saying focusing on the people themselves is of great importance in the world.
He said there were many ways to deepen the friendship and trust between people from different countries, but that little progress and effort was being made. He wished international society would continue to improve in this area.
The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. In 2001, it adopted a resolution which decided to set September 21 as the International Day of Peace. Since then, the UN puts forward the theme of the International Day of Peace every year, holding a commemoration and calling on all countries to host various commemorative activities.
Eda Satsuki said it was with regret that Japan had placed less importance on the work of international peace, despite the annual day running for 35 years. Japan has been focusing on bilateral relations in recent years, thus causing conflicts of interest.
He said although there were some conflicts of interest in Sino-Japanese diplomacy, mutual assistance and friendliness between citizens had been continuous.
Eda Satsuki spoke highly of China's recent economic and social development.




 
Chinese oil giant among 29 firms to bid for tenders as a nation recovers from international sanctions
China National Petroleum Corp, one of the country's oil giants, has been invited to bid for Iran's crude and natural gas development projects as the Persian Gulf state seeks investment in energy.
CNPC, together with 28 other oil companies including Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PJSC Gazprom, is among the international companies that have qualified to bid for tenders, according to Iran's oil ministry
If CNPC wins, the deal would be in the interests of both countries, reviving Iran's energy industry which has been hard hit by international sanctions while satisfying China, the world's second-largest economy, which has a strong demand for energy.
Iran is trying to fast-track projects to boost oil and gas production amid low prices and wants to sign agreements as soon as possible.
However, Alastair Syme, an oil analyst at Citigroup Inc in London, warns companies to be wary of investing too quickly or too much in Iran.
According to a senior engineer with CNPC, despite years of sanctions leading to a hammered economy and infrastructure, Iran, with the world's biggest natural gas reserves-estimated by BP Plc at 34 trillion cubic meters- still has significant strategic importance, with its substantial reserves of oil and gas.
Strategically located in the Middle East and sharing land borders with 15 nations, Iran also plays a crucial role in the Belt and Road Initiative as an energy hub, he says.
According to CNPC, the company has been present in Iran since 2004 and is engaged in oil and gas operations and oilfield services.
In 2009, the company signed contracts with National Iranian Oil Co to develop the North Azadegan Oilfield and Phase 11 of the South Pars gas field, which began trial production in 2015.
Iran exported 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day to China in 2015, and the country recently signed a $4.8 billion (4.6 billion euros; 3.9 billion) natural gas development project with CNPC and Total.
Iran aims to attract more than $100 billion in foreign investment to boost the country's energy sector. The country has doubled its exports as crude prices rallied.
Iran boosted oil output in 2016 by 870,000 barrels per day to 3.67 million bpd by November, and has reached several preliminary agreements with international companies, despite no concrete deals having been signed yet, Bloomberg says.
The country has set a target for daily output of 5.7 million bpd of crude and condensate early in the next decade, according to Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh.

China is increasing its presence in the Arctic region's energy industry.
The country's largest energy group, China National Petroleum Corp, is the latest mainland company to venture into the region.
It is participating in the Yamal liquefied natural gas or LNG project, one of the most complex of its kind.
CNPC said it is willing to participate in more such collaborative ventures to explore Arctic oil and gas assets, to further beef up its gas reserves.
Until recently, there has been no large-scale exploration by Chinese firms in the frozen land due to Arctic countries' protectionist policy.
But analysts said Chinese energy giants' efforts in recent years to increase their presence in the Arctic have been a success, and have strategic importance.
The current projects play a strategic role, said Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a consulting company that provides analysis of China's energy market.
Many countries are interested in the massive oil and gas reserves in the far north. However, only few industry giants, such as CNPC, China National Offshore Oil Corp and China Petrochemical Corp, are qualified for the difficult and expensive game of energy exploration, she said.
In 2013, China was accorded "observer" status in the Arctic Council. That symbolized an unspoken acceptance of Beijing's presence in the region. Since then, China's visibility has increased.
CNOOC was the first Chinese oil company to enter the Arctic by partnering Icelandic company Eykon Energy.
Before CNPC secured a 20 percent stake in the Yamal LNG project from Novatek in 2014, Sinopec Group, Asia's top refiner, had evinced interest in the region.
Sinopec also held preliminary talks with Iceland over oil exploration off the northeast coast of the Nordic country. It recently signed a cooperation agreement with the Icelandic government for research and development of geothermal studies.
According to Li, as US and European energy giants dominate the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic has become a precious land for Chinese companies.
Despite technical challenges and the arduous Arctic weather, participation in the polar region gives China a foothold in the resource-rich area. This could help beef up exploration and production, she said.
Despite the recent strengthening of relations between China and Russia, Li forecast no rapid expansion in the short term.
Chinese companies have secured a 12 percent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's onshore oil concession, hoping to further participate in the development of United Arab Emirates' energy sector.
China National Petroleum Corp signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi oil company on Feb 19 for an 8 percent stake, paying 6.5 billion dirhams ($1.77 billion; 1.67 billion euros; 1.42 billion), followed by Shanghai-based CEFC China Energy Co, which obtained a 4 percent stake.
CNPC and CEFC are the venture's new Asian partners, joining Japanese and South Korean companies alongside BP Plc and Total SA. BP signed on to the project in December, and Total in January 2015.
The onshore concession is operated by the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations.
Asian companies are newcomers in the region, while European and US counterparts have pumped oil in the Middle East for more than a century.
"If you're Abu Dhabi and looking for demand growth, China is the future, and its demand is going to continue to grow," Chris Gunson, a Dubai-based lawyer at Amereller Legal Consultants, was quoted as saying by DealStreetAsia, a Singapore-based news and intelligence platform.
"For the big buyers in Asia, the logical source of that future supply is the Gulf," he says.
CEFC has also made a crude oil supply agreement with ADNOC, providing more than 13.2 million metric tons of high-quality crude annually to the Chinese market.
Ye Jianming, chairman of CEFC, says the deal enables the private company to secure long-term and stable onshore oil rights and interests for the company to engage in the exploration of upstream oil and gas in Abu Dhabi.
"This agreement enhances our ability to integrate ADNOC's onshore oil reserves with our storage facilities in China and Southeast Asia," Ye says.
Zhou Dadi, a senior researcher at the China Energy Research Society, says the deal will help unlock growth opportunities for both sides, helping Abu Dhabi and CEFC to further explore upstream exploration and ensure oil reserves.
He says the deal will help CEFC boost its oil supply capacity while helping China to get more involved in determining the global oil price.
CEFC China is among the 10 largest private companies in China and has a focus on energy and financial services.

BEIJING -- For centuries, the ancient Silk Road had played a significant role in commercial and cultural exchange among the countries plying its route.
Today, entrepreneurs are devoting themselves to rejuvenating the historical route and building a new world.
STRONGER TRADE LINKS
More than a thousand years ago, Emperor Xuanzong of China's Tang Dynasty (618 AD-907 AD) sent special envoys and fast horses to southern China thousands of miles away from the capital to get freshly picked lychees for his favorite concubine, killing many horses and envoys during the exhausting long trip.
Now even for fresh fruits tens of thousands miles away, say fresh cherries from Chile in South America, they can easily "fly" into Chinese supermarkets for ordinary people to enjoy thanks to the current convenient and fast trade routes.
China has now become the largest export destination for Chilean cherries. Data from the Chilean Fresh Fruit Exporters Association shows that during the last cherry export season, over 80 percent of the country's cherries were exported to China.
Chilean cherry planters and traders have made huge endeavors to ensure the fresh, crisp texture of cherries for Chinese customers. For example, newly picked cherries are transported to China by "private planes" to ensure good quality.
"I hope direct flights between China and Chile will be opened in the near future, so that Chile's cherries could arrive in China sooner and at a lower cost," said Ricardo Vial, trade manager of the Rucaray Corporation, a large-scale Chilean cherry manufacturer.
Poland is the world's third largest apple producing country. In 2014, the Russian government imposed a ban on food imports from the European Union and the United States in retaliation for their sanctions against Moscow over the Ukraine crisis, forcing Poland's apple exports to plunge.
"We launched a three-year apple promotion project focused on the Chinese market, bringing new hope for fruit farmers," said Miroslaw Maliszewski, principal of Polish Fruit Growers Association.
BOOMING INVESTMENTS AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION
In December 1992, China's Shougang Group bid for 98.4 percent of Peruvian Iron Ore Corporation's stocks and the right to tap, explore and run the mineral resources of its mineral field.
Shougang headquarters founded Shougang Hierro Peru S.A.A., a mining company, which extracts, processes and sells iron ore in Peru.
The company's entrepreneurial path in the South American country with a different language and environment from China has been bumpy with obstacles, both big or small.
"During the past 24 years, Shougang Group has invested nearly 1.5 billion US dollars in equipment replacement, technology transformation, environmental governance, living quarters and project expansion. Its output has surged from less than 3 million tons in 1992 to 11.12 million tons in 2015," said Kong Aimin, general manager of Shougang Hierro Peru S.A.A.
In addition to founding new companies abroad, a large number of Chinese corporations have deepened their cooperation with local companies overseas.
Zhejiang RIFA Digital Precision Machinery Company is a manufacturer of high-end precision machine tools with annual sales exceeding a billion yuan (about $145 million).
In 2014 and 2015, it bought out Italian corporations MCM and Colgar, which were suffering from an economic crisis in Italy.
The two Italian companies are world-leading machine tool manufacturers, whose customers include renowned airplane manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing and industrial giants General Electrics and Siemens.
"Improving technology, boosting development and expanding markets are not only play an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative, but they also meet the needs of both Chinese and Italian corporations," said Wang Benshan, chairman of Zhejiang RIFA Digital Precision Machinery Company.
"MCM and Colgar boast high-quality products and good word of mouth. Chinese companies help Italian ones out of difficulties with the market and funds, and increased taxes and stimulated employment for our city. This is win-win cooperation," said Maria Catrina Wono, deputy mayor of Cornaredo, where Calgar is based.
SMOOTHER PASSAGEWAY LINKING CHINA AND WEST
Kazakhstan is an important hub on the ancient Silk Road. The city of Khorgas is located in China, in Kazakhstan and on the border of the two countries. It serves as China's youngest border port city, a special economic zone forged by Kazakhstan, and the first cross-border trade area between China and its neighboring countries.
In December 2014, the Khorgos-Eastern Gate special economic zone in Kazakhstan, the most significant logistics center, was officially put into use.
Some foreign enterprises have gradually settled down in the special zone. With a soaring population and schools, hospitals, kindergartens and other supporting public facilities having been built, a brand new town is appearing. Many young Kazakh people have come to the special zone, some even giving up their jobs in big cities, because they think highly of the development potential and vitality here, said Zaslan, investment director of the special economic zone.
"The China-Kazakstan Horgos Frontier International Cooperation Center is the busiest among the three Horgoses," said transport driver Juura.
Spanning Chinese and Kazakh territory, the center is 5.28 square km in size. With special access linking the two countries, a constant stream of Chinese and Kazakh customers come here to buy Chinese commodities.
"My customers are merchants from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus and many other countries," said Zhang Wei, who sells bed linen at the center's Yiwu International Shopping Mall.
The Horgos city in China has become an important nod opening up to the West. Central Asia freight trains and China-Europe trains have linked up Horgos with the outside world.
Once the highway in Kazakhstan linking western China and western Europe is complete, travel time will be reduced from 40 days by sea to 10 days by land.
BRUSSELS -- The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to be held from May 14 to 15 in Beijing, could be a dream venue for discussing digital silk road featuring 5G communications, a European digital expert told Xinhua.
"The Belt and Road Forum is the most important event of the year which will bring about a new dynamic of cooperation. It seems the dreamed venue to discuss digital silk road and a common roadmap for 5G," said Luigi Gambardella, president of ChinaEU, a business-led international association in Brussels that promotes digital cooperation.
Gambardella said he was invited to the forum and he believes the Belt and Road Initiative could promote global peace and stability by fostering economic growth and integration of participating countries.
"It contrasts with the current economic stagnation in Europe and other regions of the world," he added. [ As a digital expert, Gambardella suggested that the discussion of the forum not be limited to railway or other types of physical connection. Building a digital silk road and 5G deployment should be prioritized too.
Speaking highly of the new technology, he defined 5G as a faster wireless broadband with a speed at least 1,000 times compared to 4G network and it enables the connection of all possible electronic devices and makes new services like driverless cars possible.
"5G constitutes a technical revolution which will change people's life greatly. I hope those countries cooperate to design and implement smart 5G cities across the Silk Road," Gambardella said.
He called for the establishment of a high-level group of experts for technical support to governments which seek to deploy 5G projects.
"Local governments deserve not only the best 5G infrastructures but a global ecosystem at service level," he said.
Ruan Zongze, deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies
Opportunities for us to work together
The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, has become the most promising platform for international cooperation. The initiative, comprising the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, has drawn a growing number of participants thanks to its global influence. More than 100 countries and international organizations support the initiative, while over 40 have signed cooperation agreements with China.
The initiative has added fresh impetus to China and the rest of the world to promote globalization and build a "community of shared destiny of humankind", which UN Security Council Resolution 2344 of March 17 referred to while calling for regional economic cooperation to promote sustainable growth in Afghanistan. The reference to a community of shared destiny of humankind in the resolution reflects the extent of China's contribution to global governance.
The UN reference was followed by New Zealand signing a memorandum of understanding on cooperation with China on March 31, indicating that more developed countries could join the Belt and Road Initiative.
Moreover, the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank already has 70 members, more than both the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. The AIIB, in fact, is the world's largest multilateral development organization after the World Bank, and has five of the G7 countries as members.
Still, some scholars in the United States doubt the intentions of China's initiative, suggesting it is part of Beijing's plan to widen its influence in Eurasia and challenge Washington's global leadership. A few US scholars have even labeled it the Marshall Plan of China and have adopted await-and-see approach, while others oppose it simply because it was proposed by China. By doing so, they are only preventing US enterprises from benefiting from the initiative.
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled for May 14-15, will provide a platform for the participants to share their views about the future development of the initiative. In other words, although launched by China, the initiative can bring great benefits for all the participating countries. And it can help Washington and Beijing to work together in fields such as infrastructure construction in the US, and take measures to boost free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Besides, the initiative can also help deepen Sino-US cooperation and promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.

A constructive alternative to the gathering dark clouds
Four years after its formal launch in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative continues to quietly generate momentum as one of the most important geostrategic developments of the new millennium.
Over the past 40 years, China has developed the greatest concentration of industrial and manufacturing capability, raising the overall standard of living of its people while also helping boost neighboring economies, which are among the greatest achievements of the human race.
Owing to its investments and still rapidly growing market for energy, food staples and raw materials, China has become the greatest economic engine powering the major economies of Africa as well.
But why is the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing so important for China? Does it mean China will further promote globalization and regional cooperation? And how should China try to seek more chances of cooperation with other countries?
The Belt and Road Initiative is vital to promoting peace and stability in two crucial regions of the world-Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Central Asia's most visionary leaders, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, President Almazbek Atambayev of Kyrgyzstan and President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan have grasped the enormous value of transforming the region, long neglected as peripheral, into a central artery of world communication and commerce, because it will bring great benefits to their peoples.
The initiative offers the prospect of fulfilling through peace, rising living standards and improved international cooperation and understanding, the goal of making the heartland of the "world island"-the combined continents of Asia, Europe and Africa-the communications heartland, or nerve center, of the world.
That is why the forum in Beijing is so important. It offers the peoples of the "world island" a constructive alternative to the sinister gathering clouds of religious fanaticism, usually generated by poverty, fear and chaos, or the advance of menacing military alliances to threaten the national sovereignty of great nations.

Helping to fulfill the dream of shared destiny
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, as a "flagship project", is one of most crucial parts of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has both economic and geopolitical goals. The impact of the Belt and Road Initiative can be gauged from the fact that, once completed, it will include more than 60 countries, more than half of global GDP, three-quarters of global energy reserves and more than 65 percent of the world population.
Due to its very substantial geographical location, the CPEC will serve as a primary facilitator in achieving the goal of global connectedness. On a regional level, it will gradually act as the center of economic activities, with plans turning into progress. It will not only benefit Pakistan's economy by creating more than 700,000 jobs in the country and adding 2 to 2.5 percent to its GDP; its larger impact will be evident for regional neighbors as well. There is good potential to link the CPEC with regional countries. The current focus is on its expansion toward the West: Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia. Its expansion toward the East may take some time, as India has occasionally expressed reservations about it, mainly on technical grounds. Yet as things are progressing, the chances that the CPEC could play a catalyst role in even bringing the two countries closer are very much there.
Russia has vital interests in this region as well, as an active partner of both China and Pakistan. The Karachi-Lahore gas pipeline, worth $1.7 billion, has been pledged by Russia. And Russia, China and Pakistan have decided to work together to restore peace in Afghanistan.
Realizing the importance of the CPEC for Central Asia and Russia, their leaderships have shown greater interest in developing more cordial and cooperative economic and geostrategic relations with Pakistan in areas such as trade, energy sharing and tourism. Keeping in view China's economic and geostrategic interest in Central Asia and Russia, it is a vital development. The increased economic cooperation between Pakistan and Central Asia and Russia will also strengthen Pakistan's role in regional organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
Iran, too, has been playing a very significant role in regional cooperation through the CPEC, and it is significant that the Chabahar and Gwadar ports, once portrayed as competitors, have now been declared sister ports. Given the changing scenarios, the Iranian leadership hinted that China, Pakistan, Iran and Russia should cooperate more for regional stability. And China-Russia-Iran-Pakistan cooperation is being discussed in this context.
Given these scenarios of regional connectivity, there is a definite chance the CPEC will sow the seeds of more comprehensive regional connectivity and fulfill the dream of shared destiny.
China and the Central and Eastern European countries must begin to view each other not strictly as competitors, but as partners
President Xi Jinping's intention to renew the once significant and famous Silk Road, and to include within it the earlier announced "16+1 Cooperation", couldn't come at a better moment from the perspective of the Central and Eastern European countries.
Considering that the majority of the CEECs, being EU member states, were severely threatened by the world economic crisis that initially hit the US financial sector and then spilled over to the rest of the world, not bypassing Europe, such a maneuver was absolutely wise. At the same time, the minority of CEECs that still are not in the EU, but ardently wish to get in, were in an even worse situation based on their underprivileged overall internal conditions.
Thus, it wouldn't be a hyperbole to describe the newly emerged form of cooperation as an offer of a helping hand to a friend or friends in need.
Suddenly the prospects for the CEECs have become encouraging, though all parties involved in regional efforts like the "16+1 Cooperation" and the much wider Belt and Road Initiative must overcome prejudices toward each other and change their mindset in order to stop seeing each other strictly as competitors, but as partners.
Notably, these challenges seem to be very demanding, since they are grounded on the diversity of 16 countries, each with disadvantages derived from complex internal circumstances and the additional burden of such external occurrences as refugee crises and terrorist threats. This is why the political elites of the participating countries must be aware that success is granted only if all participants build their relations on the Belt and Road principles of joint discussion, co-construction and sharing; creating an open, inclusive, balanced and benefits-sharing framework of regional economic cooperation; practicing a new approach to sharing power and responsibility; and pursuing benefits and righteousness alike.
Following these principles will lead to realization of the key objective of the Belt and Road's "five ways of connectivity" : policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bonds.
And when it comes to the other essential part of the "16+1 Cooperation" equation - that is, China - it is necessary to abolish ideological divisions and geopolitics and push forward comprehensive and balanced development of China-EU relations by promoting further and in-depth cooperation between the two markets, two civilizations and two powers - China and Europe.
So far, driven by the coordination of "the 16+1 Cooperation" platform, official institutions and local governments of China and the CEEC have formed a series of policy coordination such as between prime ministers, ministers, departments and bureaus. The resources from all parties and policy instruments are power factors that can help form new and creative decision outcomes and support tools.
What is more, the "16+1 Cooperation" promotes active engagement of enterprises, financial institutions and people organizations; contributes to complex and multiple interest interaction among all powers; improves the shift or integration of the industry chain, financial products and collective and individual factors toward the Central and East European market; and shores up confidence of the Belt and Road in the CEEC market.
Since the "16+1 Cooperation" is a format that provides an institutional framework for the initiatives, both in programs and projects, in economy, investment and finances, as well as in the areas of research, science, education and culture, China and the CEECs by now have established at least 15 coordination mechanisms or platforms. These are in such areas as economy and trade, investment, tourism, local cooperation, transportation, logistics, technical cooperation, think tanks and health. Such kinds of coordination mechanism or platforms are an innovation in the field of policy communication. They are practical, flexible and targeted.
In trying to summarize projects that have so far been initiated or realized, one could easily get the impression that the infrastructure projects are overwhelming. Certainly the substantial infrastructure projects so far accomplished have opened the door to cooperation, but of the greatest importance, at this point, is the opening of communication between the CEECs and Chinese entrepreneurs and innovators that will lead to full utilization of the aforementioned projects. The relevance of roads, railways and bridges definitely shouldn't be argued, but success of both the "16+1 Cooperation" and the Belt and Road will be measured by the bulk of goods that have been transported, the number of people who have traveled, and the volume of financial transactions that have flowed between the countries.
The CEEC's stakeholders should bear in mind that Chinese partners are receptive to exceptional business ideas. Thus, there is a need for pushing forward domestic industrial transformation and upgrading and a necessity to overcome the role of plain consumer and take on the role of innovator and manufacturer. Such changes would naturally lead to a more open, inclusive and diversified type of cooperation that would easily assure stable finances and even welcome third parties.

TOKYO - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said that the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) attracting members from Asia and beyond is a positive for infrastructure development in Asia.
Kuroda, former Asian Development Bank chief, said in a speech recently that in terms of infrastructure development in Asia, there was room for more than just the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
"It's simply not possible for the ADB and the World Bank to fill the gap completely in infrastructure development in Asia," The BOJ chief said during a question and answer session after a speech he made in Yokohama on Tuesday.
He also noted that healthy competition among various players is a positive for infrastructure development and economic growth.
Kuroda was speaking at a gathering of think tanks organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Institute ahead of the 50th annual meeting of the ADB later this week.
The ADB currently comprises 67 member states and regions and has for a long time assisted developing countries with advancement projects by way of loans.
The AIIB's members, however, while not including Japan or the United States, have already stood at 70, with the bank poised to make significant inroads into regional infrastructural development projects.
During his speech, the BOJ chief called on policy makers to ensure that households and businesses have access to financial services, stating that this is key to poverty reduction in Asia.
He also said that removing existing barriers that are currently preventing financial inclusiveness is of paramount importance to reducing poverty.
Kuroda added that information and communication technology will continue to play a large part in the development of Asia by way of helping financial inclusion mechanisms to expand.
The former ADB chief said that economic growth in Asia specifically over the last 50 years has been key to driving down poverty.
BEIJING -- A total of 62.4 percent of Chinese adults read via the popular messaging app WeChat in 2016, up 10.5 percentage points year on year, according to a survey released on Tuesday.
About 68.2 percent of adults read digitally in 2016, up 4.2 percentage points than 2015, while 58.8 percent read paper books, only a 0.4 percentage-point increase, according to an annual poll on reading habits, which was carried out in 52 cities across the country.
The survey, conducted by the Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, revealed that 66.1 percent of respondents read on their mobile phones in 2016, up 6.1 percentage points than the previous year.
The average spending of reading on mobile phones was 16.95 yuan ($2.46) per capita in 2016, 5.76 yuan more than the previous year, the survey showed.
A total of 25.2 percent of respondents would accept paid reading on mobile phones, while the rest would only read free of charge.
On average, Chinese read 7.86 books per capita in 2016, including 3.21 e-books, the survey showed.
WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging app, is being used for an ever longer period of time and is growing into a lifestyle choice embedded into daily activities and interactions, a new survey has found.
In 2016, one-third of WeChat's 889 million monthly active users spent a solid four hours or more per day on the mobile chatting tool, twice that of a year ago, according to Penguin Intelligence, a research arm of WeChat's developer Tencent Holdings.
The average daily time spent is also up slightly, now at 66 minutes, surpassing that of Facebook's average 50 minutes recorded last year.
And it's becoming more pervasive and stickier than ever, creeping into new aspects of life from offline payments to receiving newsfeeds.
A striking 92 percent of respondents to the survey said they prefer mobile payment over cash and credit cards when shopping in stores. Speed, convenience and "not bothering to carry cash" are the top three reasons cited for using mobile wallets to buy movie tickets and pay utility bills.
It's also transforming the way people get information. WeChat's public accounts, which allow media services, industry bloggers and corporate branding campaigners, to feed content to subscribers, are quickly gaining traction. Nearly 60 percent of users expressed the willingness to tip good content producers.
Already cementing WeChat's position as the nation's most-used app, users found a majority of newly added contacts are casual acquaintances, notably in work-related communication. About 45 percent of WeChat users reported to have over 200 contacts, up from just 10 percent a few years ago.
Such a trend is turning the app into a virtual workplace. Over 80 percent of people have handled office work on WeChat, from transferring files and coordinating tasks to taking video calls and making transactions.
"The all-in-one super app is radically changing the way I live. When lining up for coffee, I can't see a single customer holding a wallet - instead they hold mobile phones over a reader and the lattes are theirs," said Fred Wellington, an Australian auditor working in Shanghai.
Last year, WeChat users helped drive 174.3 billion yuan ($25.3 billion) of information-sector spending and created jobs for 18.8 million people, according to a separate study by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology released in early April.
Mobile apps are gaining additional steam by integrating payment functions into public service platforms, said Lu Wei, secretary-general of the Internet Society of China. With a few taps on the phone, users can declare personal taxes, pay traffic fines and make medical appointments, he said.
The internet-enabled digital economy had claimed 30.6 percent of China's GDP by 2016, according to the China Internet Plus and Digital Economy Index published this month.

Try a locally flavored meal, get your shoes shined, mail a postcard or just grab some groceries. More and more Chinese family travelers are opting to taste the flavor of old Los Angeles at a legendary farmers market.
"They are increasingly open to explore real stories of American people," said Lexie Wei, a Los Angeles-based tourism consultant. "Chinese tourists' interest and tastes have improved. They want stories."
Wei's recent WeChat blog on the Original Farmers Market, an old farmers market in Los Angeles, has generated more than 60,000 views in just a few weeks.
An article introducing the market's history and stories behind its shops and restaurants turned out to be a hit with the Chinese audience.
"It's not just an average farmers market. It has a rich history. It is a microcosm of the American culture, and represents the vicissitudes of Los Angeles and even the history of Chinese immigration," said Wei.
Established in 1934, the open-air market has more than 100 different shops, restaurants and grocers. It evolved from a traditional farmers market, where farmers sold their vegetables and produce to local customers, to a tourist destination. Two Chinese restaurants have been there for decades.
"The market is a unique place with a lot of history and charm. It's a cultural landmark in Los Angeles," said Maritza Cerrato, marketing and tourism specialist with the Original Farmers Market.
"Ninety percent of the shops are family owned and operated. You can meet the owners, and in many shops you can see multi-generations of families working side-by-side," said Cerrato. "Local people come here and sit at the same table every day, read newspapers and talk about the news with their friends. This is a place for visitors and locals to meet."
Meeting local people and learning stories of human interest are the top reasons the farmers market is gaining popularity among Chinese travelers.
"There is a sandwich shop run by the original owner in his 90s, a toy store operated by a veteran and an Asian restaurant run by an American couple who had lived in Singapore for many years," said Wei.
The US tour operators need to dig deep and present these stories to Chinese visitors, because in the future, travelers aged 25 to 35 will make up the majority of overseas Chinese tourists and they tend to focus on the cultural experience, said Wei.
"A combination of nature, stories and urban development will mostly resonate with Chinese visitors," she said.
The Original Farmers Market started noticing the increase in Chinese visitors a year ago.

Chinese tourists doubled spending while visiting Britain in the months after the UK's vote to leave the European Union, according to a survey by Global Blue, a tax refund firm.
The survey shows that Chinese visitors now make up 33 percent of tourists taking advantage of duty-free purchases in the United Kingdom, and that they increased their spending by 103 percent in February, due almost entirely to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. The pound has slipped 15 percent against the US dollar since June.
Chinese flight bookings to the UK in January rose 81 percent year-on-year, according to travel analysts at ForwardKeys, and for the first three months of this year, Chinese flight reservations to the UK were 43 percent up on last year.
Jo Leslie, who runs the Great Chinese Welcome Programme for the government agency Visit Britain, said:"Chinese tourists in London spend twice as long there as they do in mainland Europe, spend twice as much money, and the numbers are growing at twice the rate."
In the UK, shoppers can make duty-free purchases if they have a permanent address outside the EU. Until recently, they had to pay the duty at the time of their purchase and claim it back at the airport before leaving.
Global Blue, a tax refund specialist, recently struck an agreement with UnionPay, which provides card and transaction services for most Chinese banks. Many Chinese tourists can now pay for goods when they visit Britain and either get a transfer straight to their bank card, as long as it has a UnionPay logo, or get an immediate refund while still in country, provided they claim, with receipts, from specific payment points.
The new system completely eradicates queuing at airports and waiting for weeks for a refund payment to reach a claimant's account, according to Global Blue.
The results are in for the Amazing China 2016 election, an annual survey where foreign experts in China vote for their favorite Chinese city.
Shanghai, China's financial hub, was selected as expats' favorite city to work and live in for the fifth year in a row.
Beijing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Changhun followed on the list.
The election also looked at attractive Western cities in China, in which Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, Xi'an, Lhasa, Guiyang, Lanzhou, Nanning, Yinchuan, Xining, Urumqi and Hohhot were selected as the top 12.
The Amazing China 2016 election was conducted from November 2016 to January 2017. The results were analyzed from 30 votes from top expert panels, 1,701 signed votes from foreign experts in China and 22,780 votes from Internet users.
Attracted by jobs, deterred by pollution
When asked about the most attractive factor of working in China, the country's abundant employment opportunities topped the list at 52.7 percent. China's economic prospects accounted for 45.4 percent, and openness and degree of internationalization (39.1 percent) was selected as the third most attractive factor.

My taxi pulls up at the grand door to Jiangnan University in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, under a summer sky coated in Azure blue as bright and as a baby boy's freshly-painted bedroom. Beaming golden sunshine beats down upon my brow as I make my way through the giant campus entrance, enticed on by the far-off rhythms of beating drums.
I'm here to attend the 7th Jiangnan University Food and Culture Festival, an event not to be missed by any foodie worth his salt, or with half an idea what a free lunch looks like.
Wuxi's biggest university, Jiangnan is home to nigh on 200 overseas students, hailing from such far-flung destinations as Ghana, Bangladesh, and Syria. The festival celebrates the diverse cultures which come together through the school's many exchange programs – the ingredients of which provide a succulent dish to behold.
Arriving at a snug courtyard hugged by emerald-tinged water on all sides, guests make their way across a red-carpeted gangplank draped in the multicolored flags of nations far and wide.

China never lacks access to quality animation productions. The difficulty lies in how to translate them successfully and adapt them into the market, but young Chinese animation creators are on the move. Zhang Xingjian reports.
These hit animations may shape several vivid characters, have fascinating animation effects or boast an interesting yet rigorous storyline. However, they are seldom made in China. But that trend could be in the past.

Chinese pop singer Coco Lee announced on Feb 14 her "18" concert tour plan for 2017.
By naming her upcoming concert tour "18", the American-Chinese singer hopes to bring back the "courage, passion and curiosity of an 18-year-old," she said at the official kickoff of the tour in Shanghai.
Lee started her career in 1992 winning a new talent singing award in Hong Kong, and soon gained national fame with her sultry style and vigorous performances.
Last year's TV appearance won her a younger and newer fan group among Chinese audiences, and her trusted promoter, Timeless Treasure, convinced her that "if you put on a concert, many people will be coming".
The first leg of her "18" concert will take place at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center on May 6, before going on to Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an in Shaanxi province, Chengdu in Sichuan province, Hong Kong and Taipei, as well as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto.
Editor's note:
While folk music is no longer mainstream in China, some popular TV talent shows have recently brought it back into the spotlight. And if you like poems or want to enjoy a cup of coffee in a quiet bar, folk music from a group of young Chinese singers makes a nice accompaniment. With its poetic or funny lyrics, slow tempo and melodies, the music is the young generation's way of understanding love and fights in their lives.
Here we choose seven popular young folk singers and their masterpieces in recent years.

After an on-and-off month-long race to win over customers with free rides, Chinese bike-sharing pioneers ofo and Mobike have entered a new round of competition, with both companies offering users random cash rewards of up to 5,000 yuan per ride.
Following Mobike's cash-reward plan, launched in late March, ofo announced on April 16 that it would offer its own rewards. Both companies are offering random gifts ranging from one to thousands of yuan per ride, provided the ride lasts more than 10 minutes and covers a distance of at least 500 meters. In particular, ofo offers a maximum of 5,000 yuan for reward.
Mobike users hoping to cash in need to find and unlock bikes marked with hongbao, or red, cash-filled envelopes. Ofo users, meanwhile, can ride any bike within particular regions tagged as offering hongbao. Ofo also noted that higher rewards are more likely to be given to users who park their bikes in city-designated areas. As for Mobike, the company's cash rewards aim to encourage all users to increase the efficiency of shared bike use.
Shared bikes are becoming increasingly popular in China, especially among white-collar workers during rush hour. Hence, bikes are often in high demand near bus or subway stations. While the rewards aim to strategically guide the distribution of bikes, it remains difficult to produce bike flow from offices to transportation hubs in order to guarantee bike supply.
Nevertheless, both companies appear to be thriving. Mobike announced on April 13 - less than one month after its reward policy was made public - that it set a record of 20 million bike rides on a single day. Ofo achieved its own record of 10 million rides at the end of March, media reported.

Last weekend, I was hanging out downtown with a friend and my sister. We were walking through a public spare when all of a sudden a heated argument between a student and a middle-aged woman arrested our attention.
Out of curiosity, we all stopped to look and found that they were arguing over an Ofo bike which has recently become quite popular in this city, along with two other bike-sharing companies including Mo-bike.
From what we observed, it seemed that the student saw two unoccupied bikes on the square and decided to peddle one away. But the woman claimed that she was asked to guard the two bikes for her friends who had gone to the toilet. So the woman held the bike handle-bar and refused to let it go. She told the girl loudly that she had to call her friends first to check with them before agreeing to let go of the bike.
The student found this absurd and lashed out the woman by saying that. "What is wrong with you? This is not a bike personally owned by you. This is supposed to be public facilities. You have absolutely no right to keep it." After hearing this, the woman shouted that she was going to slap the girl if she talked to her like that ever again. The atmosphere got increasingly tense. Both parties seemed to be determined to win the argument. The student then apologized to the woman in a not so friendly tone and started trying to talk some sense into her and convinced her to let go of the bike.
As all this was happening, nobody seemed to want to intervene during the heat of the moment. In fact, there was a vacant bike lying a few meters away from them. We walked away before witnessing the end of the tussle.
While walking, we were discussing who was to blame. I personally understood why the girl was so angry, even though I might not agree with her taking out her anger on the woman in a public place which was only going to make her less willing to budge. My friend and sister seemed to believe the girl should give up arguing with her and simply use the third bike lying around. They reckoned sometimes we simply can't win no matter how reasonable we may sound.
Bike-sharing services can serve people very well, considering that the underground system in this city is still under construction, which has to block many roads and worsen the already terrible traffic. So, these bikes are welcome to the public considering that it can be very cheap. Furthermore, people are doing exercising while peddling and can make some contribution to environmental protection. This is more like shooting a few birds with one stone.
But the new bike-sharing fever is accompanied with problems. For a whole week, I kept seeing a Mo-bike at the front door of my neighbor's flat where it's not supposed to be parked. It was there every morning when I headed to my workplace and it was still there every night when I came back home. Of course, it may not be the same one.
Also, I have heard, more than once, from friends claiming that they would like to bike lock up the bike or take it home. Apparently, some people still haven't fully realized that it's illegal to do that.
Of course, the government has realized this and some people have been warned or even suspended from their jobs for violating the rules of using these bikes. As this is still pretty new, both the public and the companies owning these bikes need time to adjust. But hopefully, more people in the near future will stop treating the public facilities like private possessions.
Aside from this problem, I really hope the government can make the roads in cities more bike-friendly. From my personal perspective, it's pretty risky to ride a bike in Chinese cities. Things are probably much better in some metropolises, but here in Changsha, I don't really see separated bike lanes. Even though some lanes are labeled as bike lanes, they are most of the time unfortunately occupied by private vehicles or motorcycles. Having to watch out for traffic from all directions seems to be pretty common in this city. I have become accustomed to being very cautious when walking across a road. Even though there are traffic lights everywhere, it's not safe.
It would be really nice to see China become a kingdom of bikes again. This will undoubtedly help address the urgent air pollution and meanwhile help improve public health. But still a lot more measures should be taken by both the government and the public before the desirable goals are achieved.

Fight by startups to be unicorn of emerging sector proving costly
Painting their bikes in highly conspicuous hues of yellow, orange or blue, China's 30-odd bike-sharing startups sport a parade of colorful branding and are striving to return the nation to its place of honor as the "kingdom of bicycles".
While bike-sharing is no rarity elsewhere in the world, the Chinese version gives wheels to the concept, with customers able to find a free bike anywhere in the city closest to you (located via GPS on an app) and leave them when they are finished in their journeys.
The concept is all the rage among students and young professionals across the nation for being convenient, green and cheap. An average 30-minute ride costs 0.5 yuan (7 cents).
But the fight to become the unicorn of the burgeoning sector has proven to be a rather costly one.
In the latest development, ofo, a leading player featuring iconic yellow bike offerings, was officially added to the line-up of Didi Chuxing, the nation's dominant riding hailing app.
Didi, which drove rival Uber out of the country after years of cash burning, has folded ofo's bike-sharing functions into its "hugely popular app with 400 million users", according to a company statement.
When Didi users want to revert to bicycles as a means of transportation, ofo's service is displayed as an option on Didi's platform, which is already laden with everything from buses and taxis to chauffeur services.
Aside from app integration, Didi said it will tap into ofo's data allowing it to design "more efficient bike-bus transfer options" on its shuttle bus service.
"Didi will involve ofo into its own algorithmic model via artificial intelligence techniques and provide real-time travel options to users," said Neil Wang, China president at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
This marks a direct counter-punch to ofo's chief competitor Mobike, which in early April got linked into WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging-to-payment app owned by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, taking the bike-sharing craze to new heights.
The tie-up allows Mobike to be at the immediate disposal of 889 million WeChat users starting a video chat, to browse news and conduct payment via the app. A Mobike icon is placed on the top of an array of e-wallet offerings, which also include Didi's services and ticket booking.
Ofo and Mobike, which are rekindling Chinese people's interest in a traditionally preferred mode of transport, are the latest darling of the capital market.
Following $450 million in Series D funding by a consortium including Didi, the cash-rich smart bike company announced a week earlier fresh strategic investment from Ant Financial Services Group, the nation's top e-payment provider.
Meanwhile, Mobike has attracted more than $300 million in investment so far this year from a list of prominent names including Temasek, Hillhouse Capital, and Tencent.
The landscape is getting red-hot as players compete to be the number one choice for bike riders. By working with Sesame Credit, a credit-rating system developed by Ant Financial, ofo waived a 99 yuan deposit fee for users in Shanghai whose Sesame Credit reached 650.
To fend off competition, rival Mobike is giving deep subsidies through random cash incentives to retain users.
Compared with the enormous input companies need to purchase huge fleets of bikes and make them accessible for rent through an app, the seemingly utopian model has already been subject to skepticism over its ability to turn a profit.
The business model followed by so many bicycle-sharing companies just doesn't appear (yet) to have any competitive advantage, according to Jeffrey Towson, a management professor at Peking University and a private equity investor.
"It doesn't create a superior service like taxi ride-sharing (more drivers means shorter waiting times). It doesn't create a much lower cost structure per unit," he said.
As bikes get fancier and more expensive, it would still take about a year to recoup the production expenses of a bike, not to mention maintenance, theft and vandalism, he added.
"While the market may well consolidate, there is no reason yet to think the business itself will generate any type of exceptional profitability," he said.
But the sector still encourages investors to plow in money and resources because of the huge traffic such apps bring in, said Lu Zhenwang, chief executive officer of Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy.
"The area is destined to be a fierce battlefield for internet giants as they strengthen online-to-offline deployment and race to become the prioritized cashless payment tool," he said.
Wang from Frost agreed, saying that the most direct support from Didi is the huge customer base and traffic it owns, which will stimulate the explosion of users as well as daily orders for ofo.
"The WeChat-Mobike linkup has proved that such strategic cooperation does boost the number of active users significantly. In the future, this is not simple investment in money, but in resource sharing in the long run," he said.

A smiling face with tears, or 'Tears of Joy", was chosen as the most popular emoji globally, with 21.25 percent of reaches used on social media, according to a report released by Chinese tech startup Kika.
Based on internet user behavior across the world, the report "Emoji, the Rise of New World Language" shows that "Tears of Joy" ranked No 1 as used by netizens, followed by "Heart" in second place and "Love" in third.
The report also indicated that Chinese people check their Wechat 14.5 times on average and spend 48 minutes on social media per day. "Grin" is the emoji that Chinese used the most.
"Face with Tears of Joy" became one of the most frequently used "words" in 2015 and was also the word of the year as judged by the Oxford English Dictionary.
Like text messages, different emoticons represent different meanings and emotions. They are often more intuitive and simple than words, which is also the reason they have become so popular worldwide. Therefore, more and more people choose to express their emotions and ideas by using emojis.

"Funny", a made-in-China emoji, inclusively used on Tieba, the largest Chinese communication platform provided by the search engine giant Baidu, seems to have recently moved beyond just China.
Now, it is more than an emoji, but a cultural derivation.
Reaching global markets
A series of "funny" emoji-based bolsters have attracted the attention of Japanese customers through Amazon Japan, an online shopping center.
Even if one bolster costs about 1,750 yen ($16.73), more than three times the price in China, it doesn't dampen their desires to buy it.
One Japanese customer Miki said: "They are just so cute and I bought three bolsters at one time for my family. And every time I see them, my mood just brightens suddenly."
"I think the emoji implies very complicated meanings. Different people can read different things from it. For example, my dad will send it on the occasion when he did not agree with someone but he has to say something and behave politely. But one of my friends think it is nothing but an expression of fun," said one Japanese netizen Kiro Kara.
Beijing's Parkview Green complex is awarded for its energy-saving environment. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Malls used to be all about shopping, but as air quality becomes one of the top concerns globally, some of them have set out to make themselves urban retreats.
Beijing's Parkview Green, a complex that includes offices, a shopping mall, an art center and a hotel, was recently awarded the LEED Dynamic Plaque by the US Green Building Council, a nonprofit organization based in Washington which promotes sustainability in buildings.
This follows the LEED Platinum certification it earned in 2009.
Parkview Green is the first building in the Asia-Pacific region to win the plaque.
LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is a rating system developed by USGBC that encourages green practices in the real estate industry by measuring energy efficiency, water conservation, waste and recycling, transportation and user experience. It is used in more than 160 countries.
The LEED Dynamic Plaque, which was launched recently, emphasizes a building's performance like real-time monitoring for environmental protection and energy conservation, and user experience.
With its glass exterior and steel frame structures, Parkview Green's energy consumption is 50 percent lower than industry standards. It also has a rain collection system that filters rain water for irrigation, and an air filtration system that keeps the PM2.5 under 60 at all times.
Oliver Lai, Parkview Green's general manager, says that environmental protection is not about design, but is in day-to-day operations. "This is not just an award. It is a lifetime motivator for us to be part of the green movement," he says.
While this type of building requires more investment in the early stages, the cost will balance out in a few decades with the energy saved, he adds.
Parkview Green will display real-time energy conservation data in the building.
Sarah Alexander, the vice-president of USGBC, says that China is now the second country after the United States in LEED usage, with more than 3,300 projects, which cover more than 161 million square meters.
"Market transformation happens one project at a time, and China has an opportunity to drive sustainability on a global scale."
In the next five years, she says she hopes China will aspire to getting thousands of buildings certified and set a goal of 1 billion square meters of certified space.
Feng Yi, vice-chairman of the Beijing Construction Association, says he hopes the construction industry in China follows the Parkview Green example and becomes part of the green building movement.
Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France on Sunday with a business-friendly vision of European integration, defeating Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist who threatened to take France out of the European Union, early projections showed.
The centrist's emphatic victory, which also smashed the dominance of France’s mainstream parties, will bring huge reliefto European allies who had feared another populist upheaval to follow Britain's vote to quit the EU and Donald Trump's election as US president.
Five projections, issued within minutes of polling stations closing at 8 pm (1800 GMT), showed Macron beating Le Pen byaround 65 percent to 35 - a gap wider than the 20 or so percentage points that pre-election surveys had pointed to.
Even so, it was a record performance for the National Front,a party whose anti-immigrant policies until recently made it apariah in French politics, and underlined the scale of the divisions that Macron must now try to heal.
Le Pen's high-spending, anti-globalisation 'France-first'policies may have unnerved financial markets but they appealedto many poorer members of society against a background of highunemployment, social tensions and security concerns.
Macron's immediate challenge will be to secure a majority innext month's parliamentary election for En Marche! (Onwards!),his political movement that is barely a year old, in order toimplement his programme.
The 39-year-old former investment banker, who served for twoyears as economy minister but has never previously held electedoffice, will become France's youngest leader since Napoleon with a promise to transcend outdated left-right divisions.
At least one opinion poll published in the run-up to thesecond round has indicated that the majority he needs could bewithin reach.
Despite having served briefly as economy minister inPresident Francois Hollande's deeply unpopular Socialistgovernment, Macron managed to portray himself as the man torecast a political landscape moulded by the left-right divisionsof the last century.
While Macron sees France's way forward in boosting thecompetitiveness of an open economy, Le Pen wanted to shieldFrench workers by closing borders, quitting the EU's commoncurrency the euro, radically loosening the bloc and scrappingtrade deals.
Socialist Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuze said France hadchosen to retain its place at the heart of Europe.
Shortly after the first projections were published, Le Pen,48, said she had congratulated Macron. But she defiantly claimedthe mantle of France's main opposition in calling on "allpatriots to join us" in constituting a "new political force".
Her deputy said this new force would not be called "NationalFront".
When he moves into the Elysee Palace after his inaugurationnext weekend, Macron will become the eighth - and youngest -president of France's Fifth Republic.
He plans to blend a big reduction in public spending and arelaxation of labour laws with greater investment in training.
A European integrationist and pro-NATO, he is orthodox inforeign and defence policy and shows no sign of wishing tochange France's traditional alliances or re-shape its militaryand peace-keeping roles in the Middle East and Africa.
His election also represents a long-awaited generationalchange in French politics that have been dominated by the samefaces for years.
He will be the youngest leader in the current Group of Seven(G7) major nations and has elicited comparisons with youthfulleaders past and present, from Canadian Prime Minister JustinTrudeau to British ex-premier Tony Blair and even President JohnF. Kennedy in the United States.

The traditional Chinese lunar calendar divides the year into 24 solar terms. Start of Summer (Chinese: 立夏), the 7th term of the year, begins on May 5 and ends on May 20 this year.
Start of Summer signals the transition of seasons. On this day, the sun's rays reach an angle of 45 degrees to the earth. The temperature will rise quickly during this period, yet in northern China weather remains mild, not tropical.
Here are five things to learn about the Start of Summer.
A miner carves out blocks of salt from the Danakil Depression in Afar, Ethiopia. Technology and the opening of the area to investment and tourism are threatening the traditional way of life.Zacharias Abubeker / Afp
LAKE ASALE, Ethiopia - Every morning, hundreds of men converge on a dry lake bed in a remote corner of Ethiopia, where they cleave the ground open with handaxes to extract salt, just as their fathers and grandfathers once did.
They toil under the gaze of a caravan of camels who will carry their salt bricks to market, in a trek that historians estimate has gone on since the 6th century.
But with the Ethiopian government opening the isolated northern region to investors and tourists by cutting new roads through surrounding mountains, the laborers, traders and caravan drivers that make up the industry say their traditional way of life could soon be lost.
"If it continues like this, it will stop our work," miner Musa Idris said as he stood on the cracked earth that fringes Lake Asale, where the miners work amid temperatures that can reach 50 C, making it one of the world's hottest places.
Salt mining was once so vital to the economy of the depression that the seven-kilogramme chunks of salt Idris and his colleagues hack from the ground were used as currency.
While the trade is still important, it is no longer the only game in town.
Restaurants and hotels have sprung up in the area, also known as the Danakil depression, to cater to tourists who come from across the globe to visit the uniquely desolate landscape formed by the intersection of three tectonic plates.
The region has also attracted foreign firms that want to mine potash and send it to Asia.
The presence of salt in the area has not escaped the attention of mining companies.
A handful of kilometers away from where Idris and his colleagues gather, an Ethiopian company has built a plant that sucks water from the lake into evaporation ponds, creating salt the miners say is of a better quality but costs more than the square blocks they mine from the lake bed.
"The traditional way is quite different from ours. That one takes more toil and time," evaporation plant manager Maheri Asgedew said of the manual way of mining.
Perhaps no development has impacted the traditional salt industry like the new roads.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country and one of the continent's best-performing economies, with growth reaching nearly 10 percent in 2015.
The government has made projects such as dams and road-building a priority as part of its strategy to end the poverty that afflicts around one in three of its citizens.
Getting the salt-laden camels from Lake Asale to the nearest city Mekele used to be a four-day trek down rock-strewn gullies.
Now, the caravans terminate in Berhale, the region's main salt trading outpost which road builders connected to Mekele by tarmac about five years ago.
The journey takes only three days, an improvement that some of the camel drivers and labourers who help offload the salt bricks have welcomed, but which others worry is a sign that technology will soon put them all out of business.
"We have no water and sometimes we eat bad food," said Musa, whose daily pay of 500 birr ($22) affords him a house in Hamed Ela, a ramshackle settlement of huts near the salt fields.
"If technology comes and changes it, it would be better."
But others embrace the traditional way. For them, it's simply the family business.
"We see this as our farmland, so we don't have anything else but this," miner Indris Ibrahim said. "My children and grandchildren will hopefully mine in this area."

China Post has recently released on its WeChat account a free set of 16 animated stickers, or biaoqing bao, each portraying a type of dinosaur found in China.
In each sticker, the cartoon dinosaur expresses various emotions, such as shock, joy and anger, or depicts a scene, such as saying goodbye.
Featured genera include the Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic, the remains of which were first found in Sichuan province in 1979, and Liaoningosaurus from the early Cretaceous period; two fossil specimens were collected in Liaoning province.
The stickers are to generate interest in a set of seven stamps, titled Dinosaurs of China, which China Post will issue on May 19.
Voters in Japan are deeply divided over campaign to revise Article 9
TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday that he hopes to see a revised Constitution go into effect in 2020 under a plan that will see the first change to the postwar charter.
Speaking in a video message at a gathering to celebrate the he 70th anniversary of the Pacifist Constitution being enacted, Abe said he wanted the language in the revised Constitution to mention Japan's Self-Defense Forces.
The current charter makes no mention of the existence of the SDF in its war-renouncing pledges, which has led to a great deal of controversy regarding the constitutionality of Abe and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party camp's push to expand the scope of the nation's forces.
"By making explicit the status of the SDF in the Constitution during our generation's lifetime, we should leave no room for contending that the SDF may be unconstitutional," the prime minister said.
In an upper house election held last July, Abe's ruling coalition won a sweeping majority and along with conservative and pro-revision forces, the ruling camp command a two-thirds majority in both chambers necessary to call a national referendum on changing the constitution.
Article 9 of Japan's Pacifist Constitution states that "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes".
It goes on to state: "Land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."
Voters in Japan are deeply divided over Abe's campaign to revise the Constitution, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
The Nikkei Inc/TV Tokyo survey showed about 46 percent of respondents favored keeping the Constitution as it is, four percentage points lower than a similar poll last year.
The number favoring a change stood at 45 percent, up five percentage points from a year ago.
Protection mission
Meanwhile, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force Sazanami destroyer has joined the Izumo helicopter carrier in escorting a United States Navy vessel, sources said on Wednesday.
The Sazanami joined the mission having departed from a MSDF base in Kure on Tuesday, Kyodo News quoted government and other sources as saying.
Japan's Ministry of Defense previously said the inaugural mission, since the contentious new legislation took effect last year, is aimed at a showing of Japanese force alongside that of the US.
The Izumo, the largest warship Japan has entered into service since World War II, and widely regarded as de facto aircraft carrier, left its base in Yokosuka on Monday for the mission.


Japanese PM aims to revise Constitution before 2020

TOKYO - In a recent televised statement, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he hoped to see a revised version of the country's pacifist Constitution take effect from 2020.

It would mark the first time since the end of Word War II that Japan's pacifist charter will be changed.

Some of the prime minister's recent remarks on revisions to the Constitution were based on the idea that the current charter makes no mention of Japan's Self-Defense Forces.

But while Abe plans to forge ahead with parliamentary debate on the issue and use his ruling bloc's majority to pave the way for the legislation to be passed, a peace-loving public might prove to be a monumental stumbling block.

"The Constitution is part of our national identity and since the end of the war Japan has been a peaceful country and has consistently spread this message to the world," said Arisa Nagai, a student at Chou University's faculty of law.

"The younger generations will inherit whatever fundamental changes occur in Japan and as the country has enjoyed peace for the past seven decades, I don't see the need to change the Constitution."

The 27-year-old added that the majority of her peers and professors felt the same way and would oppose the move.

Opposition parties, civic groups, legal experts, scholars, political watchers and individuals, spanning the length and breadth of the country have resoundingly called for Article 9 of the Constitution to be upheld in recent days.

Article 9 states: "The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.

"Land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."

Those words have ensured Japan's forces maintained only a defensive posture, but a reinterpretation by the government saw the forces' operational scope widened to the point that now certain activities that are not wholly defensive in nature may be deemed unconstitutional.

"The browbeating in Parliament to force the (security) legislation into law was one thing, but fundamentally changing the nation's charter for the first time ever, would be a completely different proposition," said Koichi Ishikawa, a researcher at Tokyo's International Christian University.

Firm to build precision-molding demonstration park, production center in the city
Foxconn Technology Group plans to open a production center in Central China's Hunan province for Amazon.com Inc, as part of its effort to diversify and reduce its reliance on Apple Inc, according to technology website Digitimes.
The center, based in Hengyang, will produce an array of devices for Amazon, the report said, citing unnamed industry sources.
Foxconn confirmed with China Daily on Monday that it had signed a cooperation agreement with the government of Hengyang, but declined to disclose further details. Amazon declined to comment.
The plan includes building a precision-molding demonstration park and Amazon production center in the city, Digitimes reported.
The report indicated that Foxconn will enhance the production capacity of its plant in Hengyang this year, adding 30 new production lines for audio equipment and tablets, and another 15 lines for smartphones, tablet mainboards and other components.
As a main assembler of Apple's iPhone, Foxconn's expansion plan may indicate that demand for the Amazon Echo, the voice-activated personal assistant, will increase this year, analysts said.
Foxconn and Amazon have been cooperating since 2007, and it is the sole manufacturer of the Amazon Echo.
In January, Foxconn posted its first annual revenue decline since 1991. The tech giant recorded $136.38 billion in revenue in 2016, down 2.81 percent year-on-year, after its biggest client Apple saw slowing iPhones sales.
Foxconn has launched a strategy to reduce its dependence on Apple. Last year, it acquired Japanese electronics giant Sharp Corp to rejuvenate Sharp's television business and increase its production of LCD panels, with an aim to expand its product portfolio.
James Yan, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said Foxconn has a sense of crisis and is trying to reduce its heavy reliance on Apple as the sales performance of Apple's iPhone 6S and 7 is unsatisfactory.
"Foxconn hopes to ramp up its capacity and is unwilling to just rely on a single client," Yan said, adding that Apple is also reducing its dependence on Foxconn, cooperating with other contract manufacturers, such as Pegatron Corp.
Amazon has made efforts in artificial intelligence and machine learning in recent years and has become a client offering Foxconn huge growth potential.

"We will use video refereeing at the 2018 World Cup because we've had nothing but positive results so far," Infantino said at a congress of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) in Santiago, Chile.
"In 2017, when everyone in the stadium or at home can see within seconds if the referee made a mistake, we can't have a situation where the only one who can't see it is the referee."
Video assistance was introduced to support referees with "game-changing" decisions for the first time in a FIFA competition at the Club World Cup in Japan last December.
The four areas covered by the video replay official were goals, penalties, red cards and cases of mistaken identity.
Infantino had already said he wanted video refereeing for the next World Cup, but that "little hiccups" would have to be worked out first.
That included slow decision-making by video-assistant referees, he said at a meeting of the International Football Association Board in March.
"The referees... will be able to take decisions much faster when they use it more often," he said.
CONMEBOL said on Wednesday it was considering ways of boosting attendance at the 2019 Copa America, South America's top international tournament, which will take place in Brazil.
Proposals include raising the number of competing countries to 16 from the usual number of 12, said CONMEBOL vice-president Arturo Salah.
It has also been suggested that European countries be invited to take part.
"The Copa America with European teams would be like a World Cup. That is a discussion for another time," Infantino said.

Four Chinese handset makers are said to be among the top five in India's smartphone market during the first quarter of 2017, according to a survey by Singapore-based industry research firm Canalys.
Xiaomi and Vivo are the second and third most popular respectively, while Lenovo moved up one spot to fourth place and Oppo now occupies the fifth position, the survey shows.
Samsung remains the most popular smartphone among buyers in India, with the South Korean smartphone maker shipping 6 million units for through the first-quarter, representing a 22-percent share.
Apple only ranks the 10th on the list due to its high price, the survey says.
Xiaomi shipped 4 million units in India, with a 14-percent market share during the first quarter, a 3-percent growth rate compared with the same period last year.
Canalys Research Analyst Ishan Dutt said Xiaomi's success in India lies in its online go-to-market strategy.
"(India's) demonetization seems to have had no impact on it, as its target customer is young, Internet-enabled and primarily buys online," Dutt said.
Vivo saw growth of 36 percent during the first three-months. It shipped nearly 3 million smartphones, representing a 10 percent market share.
Lenovo shipped 2.6 million smartphones for a 9 percent share of the Indian market.

China's Uber-type service for trucks Guiyang Huochebang Technology Co Ltd, also known as the Truck Alliance, said on Tuesday that it had raised $156 million in series B-2 funding, led by Baidu Capital, the investment arm of Baidu Inc, the country's largest search engine.
Chinese investment firm All-Stars Investment Ltd, which led the $115 million series B-1 round of funding in December, and existing investors, also participated in the latest fundraising. Moreover, a B-3 round of financing is expected to be completed soon.
So far, Guizhou-based Huochebang has raised more than $270 million in series B funding, with its valuation reaching more than $1 billion, setting a new record in online logistics platform investment.
The deal marks the second investment that Baidu Capital has made since it was established in October. In March, it jointly led a $600 million round of financing in electric vehicle startup NextEV.
Huochebang said the funding will be used to expand its truck service business and number of users, increase the technological input and attract talent, as well as expand the use of electronic toll charge cards.
Founded in 2011, Huochebang, backed by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, uses big data technology to help truck drivers find commodities to transport, and facilitates truck sales and used truck auctions.
It currently has 2.6 million registered vehicles, 300,000 corporate members and 2.3 million drivers, with 1,000 service centers around China.
In 2015, it finished series A and A+ rounds from Tencent, Hillhouse Capital and DCM, raising more than $100 million.
Wu Wenjie, a managing partner at Baidu Capital, said: "Huochebang impressed us a lot with its business model, scale of platform, and operation. It has a deep understanding of China's logistics market and has established the largest and the only nationwide matching system between truckers and shippers, holding a dominant position in this sector."
Ji Weidong, the co-founder of All-Stars Investment Ltd, said the firm is bullish about the prospects for the integration of the logistics industry and mobile internet.
Yunmanman, Huochebang's biggest rival, has finished several rounds of fundraising from Sequoia Capital, Yunfeng Capital and Lightspeed China Partners in the past three years.
The country is still at an early stage in building a matching system between truckers and shippers in long-haul trucking secotr, said Cai Lili, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys.




Passengers using commuter passes get aboard a train bound for Tianjin at Beijing South Railway Station on Sunday. [Photo by Wang Zhuangfei / China Daily]
A commuter pass for the Beijing-Tianjin intercity railway that gives a discount of up to 15 percent went on sale on Monday as part of government efforts to promote the integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province.
Last year, 646,000 passengers traveled back and forth between Beijing and Tianjin at least twice a month. The pass is expected to benefit more than 200,000 people.
The pass will save passengers the trouble of buying tickets, and the discount is expected to attract more people to commute between the two cities, Sun Wenkui, vice-mayor of Tianjin, said on Saturday.
Currently, 184 trains arrive and depart from both Beijing and Tianjin every day, carrying more than 80,000 passengers.
Calling the launch of the pass a move to promote the integration of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, Sun said the Tianjin government will "make a greater step forward" to promote the integration of the three areas' transportation systems through further cooperation with China Railway Corp, the national network operator.
There are two kinds of train passes: a gold one for first-class seats and a silver one for second-class seats. A first class seat for a single journey between Beijing and Tianjin costs 65.5 yuan ($10), while the price for second class is 54.5 yuan.
Passengers can get a 5 percent discount if they pay for 20 single journeys up front. The discount will increase to 15 percent for gold pass holders who pay for 90 journeys and for silver pass holders who pay for 100 journeys, the Tianjin government said.
Pass holders will use their cards at a special ticket machine where they can choose a train and print a ticket with a seat assignment.
"We are trying to keep the Beijing-Tianjin intercity line in the lead," said Huang Xin, deputy director of CRC's transport bureau. "The train pass is an innovation, and we are looking forward to seeing future promotions on other railways."
Passengers have been expecting the discount passes since the Tianjin government announced in February that they would be issued, said Zou Yirong, from the marketing department of Tianjin Research Institute for Advanced Equipment, affiliated with Tsinghua University in Beijing.
"The train pass was the talk of the office back then," she said, adding that about 40 researchers at her institute are regular commuters between the two cities - and they would save time and money with the passes.
Xiang Nan, chairman of a Tianjin-based investment company that has offices in Beijing and Tianjin, said: "We are definitely going to make a group purchase for me and five other colleagues who need to take the train every day."
"I used to spend 2,600 yuan on the train every month. Now 400 yuan of that can be saved. That is good news for me," said a man who only disclosed his name only as Duan. The man paid for 100 single journeys with second-class seats on Monday as he often has to travel between Beijing and Tianjin for work.

The wedge, 12-meter-long and weighing more than 25 Airbus A380 jets, was lowered to connect the immersed tubes of the underground tunnel of the bridge, said Lin Ming, chief engineer of the island and tunnel section of the bridge.
The 55-kilometer bridge connects Zhuhai in Guangdong province with Hong Kong and Macao. It includes a 22.9-km bridge and 6.7-km underground tunnel.
Before the wedge was installed on Tuesday, 33 immersed tubes, each 180 meters long and weighing 80,000 tons, had been installed.
"There is only one wedge for a tunnel, and we cannot afford to fail in its installation. It took two years to prepare for today," said Chen Yue, director of the engineers' office of the bridge's island and tunnel section. The installation procedure took about six hours.
"The margin of error for the wedge is 1.5 centimeters. We have to measure precisely the influence of wind, current and buoyancy force," said Lin.
"It is like putting a needle through a hole -- a truly unprecedented event in the history of transportation," Lin said.
A gigantic crane, which was transformed from a tanker, was used to hoist the wedge, lowering it to the desired destination between the underwater tubes.
The wedge will be welded and finished by June, Lin said.
By the end of the year, the bridge will be open to traffic, said Zhu Yongling, director of the bridge management bureau.
Construction began in December of 2009 at Zhuhai. The Y-shaped bridge starts from Lantau Island in Hong Kong with branches to Zhuhai and Macao.




 
A woman looks at the display window of Belle at a department store in Beijing. A QING / FOR CHINA DAILY
Belle International Holdings Ltd－the former No 1 women's shoemaker in the Chinese mainland－is looking at going private, a decade after its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, due to the sluggish footwear business.
A consortium made up of Hillhouse Capital, CDH Investments, and Belle directors Yu Wu and Sheng Fang, announced last week that the shoemaker's board put forward a proposal which, if approved and implemented, will result in Belle's privatization.
Under the proposal, the joint offerers will pay Belle shareholders a cancellation consideration of HK$6.3 ($0.8) a share in cash. This represents a premium of 19.54 percent over the last trading day and 12.5 percent over the 52-week closing high.
Belle's price surged 15.18 percent to close at HK$6.07 per share on Tuesday, taking its market capitalization to HK$53.1 billion, a record high on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for a privatization valuation. Prior to this, Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties' privatization deal reached HK$34.5 billion in August last year.
On completion of the proposal, Hillhouse will hold 56.81 percent of Belle, CDH will hold 12.06 percent and other participating management, including Yu and Sheng, will hold 31.13 percent.
Belle's management team has explained in the public announcement that the company has experienced "unprecedented challenges in its footwear segment" in recent years, which had led to the privatization move.
Department stores, which are Belle's primary sales channel, have suffered a significant reduction in customer traffic as a result of competition from both e-commerce and other retail channels such as shopping malls.
Belle CEO Sheng Baijiao said the company had reached a tipping point.
"Only with the combination of Belle's traditional sales model and the digital economy can the company seek sustained growth," Sheng said.
"The joint offerers have the digital expertise which we need right now," he said.
Zhang Lei, founder of Hillhouse Capital, said the consortium could help Belle realize a transformation with their knowledge of the digital economy and experience in the company's operations, seeking new opportunities in the internet age.
Founded in 1978, Belle has a range of female shoe brands including Belle, Staccato and Tata. It also runs a sportswear and apparel business, with retail distribution of brands including Nike, adidas and Moussy.
Belle hit its peak with a market cap worth HK$150 billion in 2013. Between 2005 and 2007, Belle rapidly expanded its distribution channel, opening up 1,419 new stores within 15 months from 2005.
Growth continued in ensuing years but the company started to downsize its physical network in the second fiscal quarter of 2014, closing 56 stores in three months.
Belle's aggressive expansion of its physical stores, however, can not offset disappointing sales. According to public information, the company registered 13 consecutive quarters of negative same store sales growth since the fourth quarter of the financial year ended 28 February 2014.
Net profit for fiscal year 2017 is expected to decrease by up to 25 percent.

NASSAU, Bahamas - China collected the second bronze medal at the 2017 IAAF World Relays on Sunday as their women's 4X100m team clocked a season best of 43.11 seconds.
In the heats round China fielded the same squad as they did at the Olympic Games in Rio last summer. The quartet consisting of Youth Olympics 100m gold medalist Liang Xiaojing, Wei Yongli, Ge Manqi and Yuan Qiqi clocked 43.90s to finish second behind the US team in the first heat group.
China replaced third leg Ge with Tao Yujia in the final. Yuan held off a strong challenge from Naomi Sedney of the Netherlands in the final leg to clinch the bronze medal.
Germany took an upset victory in 42.84s. Jamaica trailed 0.11 seconds to finish second. Pre-race favorites USA failed to finish after first leg runner Tianna Bartoletta slipped coming off the first turn and tumbled to the track.
Reinstated Russian would 'play juniors' for a shot at French Open, Wimbledon

STUTTGART, Germany - Maria Sharapova says she would "play in the juniors if I have to" in order to compete at the French Open and Wimbledon - but has no interest in building bridges with her rivals after making her comeback from a doping ban.
The Russian superstar marked her return from a 15-month ban on Wednesday with a 7-5, 6-3 first-round win over Roberta Vinci at Stuttgart's WTA tournament after being given a wild card.
She described victory as the "best feeling in the world" as the former world No 1 returned after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.
Sharapova has also been granted wild cards into the Madrid and Rome WTA tournaments, but must wait until May 16 to learn if she will get a wild card for the French Open.
She was very clear she will take any chance to try to win a third French Open title at Roland Garros, which starts on May 22, or Wimbledon in July.
"I'd be prepared to play in the juniors if I have to," she replied when asked about her desire to play the French Open or Wimbledon.
"Everyone in this room knows what a competitor I am and if there is an opportunity to be in the draw, I will take it.
"I have been offered wild cards and I am accepting them.
"I am not getting a trophy or a golden platter, I have to win these games. That is my job."
The organizers' decision to parachute Sharapova into the main draw in Stuttgart, where she has been champion three times, drew harsh criticism from rivals who believe she received preferential treatment.

Tense competition interrupts the usual calm of the May Day holiday
PARIS - With just six days until a French presidential vote that could define Europe's future, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron held high-stakes rallies on Monday that overlapped with nationwide May Day labor marches reminding both candidates that jobs are voters' No 1 concern.
The tense campaign interrupted the usual calm of the May Day holiday, as supporters of both candidates are taking to the streets, airwaves and social networks to weigh on an election closely watched by global financial markets and France's neighbors as a test of the global populist wave.
Le Pen's efforts to clean up the racism and anti-Semitism that has stained her anti-immigration National Front party's past may be undermined by a parallel Paris event by her father, Jean-Marie, expelled from the party over his extreme views.
Seeking to remind voters of the National Front's dark past, Macron paid homage to a Moroccan man thrown to his death in the Seine River on the sidelines of a far-right march more than two decades ago. Macron joined the man's father and anti-National Front protesters at an annual commemoration near the Louvre Museum.
The National Front traditionally holds a march in central Paris on May 1 to honor Joan of Arc, and at the 1995 event, a group of skinheads broke away and pushed 29-year-old Brahim Bourram off a bridge into the Seine, where he drowned. Then-party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen sought to distance himself from the attackers, but the death drew national outrage.
Jean-Marie Le Pen is holding the Joan of Arc event again on Monday, a march his daughter wants nothing to do with. Instead she is holding a rally in an exhibition center north of Paris.
Marine Le Pen said on Sunday that the political rupture with her father "is definitive". She called it a "violent" decision for herself, but said she did it "because the higher interest of the country was at stake".
Her event was opened by Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a conservative candidate from the first-round election who shocked many French by agreeing to be Le Pen's prime minister if she wins the presidency.
Le Pen, speaking on Monday, reached out to "all those who are patriots" and who want to restore French borders and currency and "rediscover the voice of labor, defend our identity, fight against Islamic fundamentalism".

A united front
Meanwhile, the traditional May 1 union marches across France will be politically charged this year. Some groups want a united front to keep Le Pen from the presidency, but unions also fear that Macron a former investment banker will dismantle worker protections.
Macron, who said his plans to restructure France's complex labor laws would boost job creation, said Sunday night that May 1 "is the face of a globalization that protects workers ... an accomplishment of the great labor fights to defend worker rights. ... Globalization is not only the face of those who oppress".

TIANJIN - Telecom giant China Unicom will lower international roaming charges in countries and regions along the Belt and Road starting May 1.
Roaming fees for calls made by China Unicom users will fall by an average 52 percent in 17 countries and regions, while data roaming fees will fall by an average 75 percent in 19 countries and regions.
The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China in 2013 consists of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road. It aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along and beyond ancient Silk Road trade routes.
Earlier this week, China Mobile, the country's leading telecom services provider, announced that it would lower roaming charges in 64 countries and regions along the Belt and Road starting May 1.

MANCHESTER, England — Manchester United held on following Marouane Fellaini's late sending-off for headbutting Sergio Aguero to draw 0-0 at Manchester City in the English Premier League on Thursday, keeping the race for Champions League qualification congested.
A physical midfielder never far from on-field flashpoints, Fellaini had just been booked for tripping Aguero when he fouled the City striker again, before confronting him and connecting with a butt to earn a straight red card in the 84th minute.
There were just 19 seconds between the two cards being shown.
United manager Jose Mourinho didn't criticize his midfielder for his recklessness, saying Fellaini felt he was sent off only because of his reputation and Aguero perhaps overreacted.
"I saw Aguero in the tunnel," Mourinho said. "No broken nose, no broken head, his face as nice as always. If Sergio doesn't go to the floor, for sure it's not a red card, although Marouane gave him the chance to do that."Fellaini's actions, which resulted in his third red card in nine years in English soccer, nearly undermined another dogged defensive effort by United in the 174th Manchester derby.
City sent on fit-again striker Gabriel Jesus after Fellaini's departure in an attempt to grab a late goal and the striker had a stoppage-time headed goal disallowed for offside in a tense finish at Etihad Stadium.
Mourinho's defensive tactics suffocated another heavyweight rival — it resembled an attack-vs-defense exercise in the second half — but whether a goalless draw does United any good is open to question with a month left in the season.
The result kept Mourinho's injury-hit team in fifth place, both a place and a point behind City with five games remaining in the race for a top-four finish to qualify for the Champions League. Liverpool is a point ahead of City, and has played a game more than both Manchester clubs, while Arsenal is four points behind United with a game in hand.
"City will finish top four," Mourinho said. "The matches they have to play I see them doing that. I think it's between us, Arsenal, and Liverpool."United has a difficult run-in, with trips to come to Tottenham and Arsenal, and is still involved in the Europa League, with a two-leg semifinal looming against Celta Vigo. Its squad is also ravaged by injury, a situation that won't be helped by Fellaini's upcoming three-game suspension.
By becoming only the second team, after Stoke, to stop City from scoring at home this season, United extended its unbeaten run in the league to 24 games dating to October and a loss at Chelsea.
Mourinho masterminded a 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield in October, stopping at the time the league's most prolific attack, and recently delivered a tactical masterclass in a 2-0 win over first-place Chelsea.
He relishes churning out results in the big games, especially against a managerial rival like City's Pep Guardiola, and his approach for this one was clear and expected — defend in two blocks and strike on the counterattack using the long ball and the pace of forwards Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.
It worked to an extent, although it wasn't pretty.
"We have the talent," City manager Pep Guardiola said, "but it's not easy with so many players behind the ball."Mourinho said United was "the best team in the first half and ... the best team in the second half. They were amazing, the way they fight."Rashford was particularly lively in the first half, outsprinting defender Nicolas Otamendi with embarrassing ease on occasions, and City was often thankful for the composure of fit-again captain Vincent Kompany alongside Otamendi at the back.
City might be challenging for the title — and not just a place in the top four — had Kompany stayed injury-free this season.
After the break, Rashford was left increasingly isolated up front as United sat back even more. City was utterly dominant, restricting its opponent to just seven touches in United's attacking third, but couldn't find a way past goalkeeper David De Gea.
City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was carried off on a stretcher with a calf injury moments before Fellaini's red card after injuring himself collecting a corner. He had little else to do.
In three matches between City and United this season — two in the league and the other in the League Cup — Mourinho and Guardiola have earned one win each and drawn the other.
President Juan Manuel Santos has expressed his condolences on Twitter to the victims of Monday's accident.
Investigators are looking into what caused the accident. Local authorities have told the newspaper El Tiempo that the Cessna Caravan turboprop may have run into an antenna or encountered bad weather.
The Bogota newspaper says three civilians were among those on the plane and the highest-ranking military officer killed was a lieutenant coronel.
The flight was traveling to a small airport outside Bogota from a Colombian military base.

SHEFFIELD, England - China's world number four Ding Junhui shocked five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan 13-10 to reach the semifinals of the World Snooker Championship on Wednesday.
Ding, last year's runner-up, built a 10-6 lead after two sessions on Tuesday but O'Sullivan won three of the first four frames in the final session, including a run of 146 in the 20th frame.
The Chinese star made an 87 to pull ahead 12-9 in the best-of-25 frames quarterfinal before O'Sullivan responded.
Ding, competing in his 11th world championship, gave no chance to the Rockets by killing off with a 117.
BEIJING — On-demand mobility company Didi Chuxing has added a bike-sharing service from ofo, and will promote it across China.
Didi users will have direct access to ofo's bright yellow bikes in the app through fully connected services in registration, user authentication, deposit, ride payment, and customer support, according to a Didi press release Thursday.
Didi, China's leading car-hailing service, which boasts over 20 million daily orders, made a strategic investment in ofo, one of the country's top bike-sharing services, in September 2016.
The product linkup is a major step towards more extensive collaboration in shared mobility, according to the press release.

Companies have increasingly been encouraged by the Belt and Road Initiative for going global, said a senior executive of a leading information processing and service provider in China.
"Driven by the initiative, many more Chinese companies have participated in more projects in economies along the Belt and Road Initiative with more investment," said Shi Xin, vice president of Transn IOL Technology Co Ltd, a language service platform based on big data and mobile internet technologies.
"Their businesses expanded from the traditional international engineering sector to equipment manufacturing and cultural and media sectors," Shi added.
The Belt and Road Initiative was proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, consisting of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It aims to promote the interconnectivity between Asia and the rest of the world through two ancient trade routes.
According to the Ministry of Commerce's latest data, China's trade with economies along the Belt and Road Initiative saw 26.2 percent growth year-on-year in the first quarter of 2017.
During the same period, China's non-financial outbound direct investment in 43 economies along the Belt and Road reached $2.95 billion, accounting for 14.4 percent of the country's total.
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which will be held from May 14 to 15 in Beijing, will mean an increase in this trend, Shi added.
"Actually, the forum itself has brought an outburst of our language service business since last year. The forum has great impact and a lot of companies and institutions are getting prepared for it, involving lots of translation and investigative work," Shi said.
Another new trend on Chinese companies' road towards going global is that more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been attracted to the overseas market, Shi added. "Although our service to SMEs accounts for only about 30 percent in our whole business, it grows 40 to 50 percent annually."
Compared with large enterprises, SMEs are more cost sensitive and care more about short-term returns. In order to facilitate their overseas operations and solve their concerns, Transn offers tailored products for SMEs, such as TransnBox, an interpreting device with 12 languages.
Packaged solutions are also available for SMEs, including market research, bidding, design, construction and acceptance services.
"The initiative is expected to involve more and more countries, which will be a great challenge for us to offer language services, especially for some unpopular languages. We will strengthen our cooperation with universities and institutions for more talents," Shi said.
WASHINGTON - The White House said on Monday US President Donald Trump will speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, their first call since Washington and Moscow wrangled over a US strike on Syrian government last month.
According to the daily schedule of Trump released by the White House, the call will be made on Tuesday at 12:30 pm EDT (1630 GMT).
Trump on April 6 ordered a targeted missile strike at a Syrian military airfield in response to a chemical weapons attack in the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun allegedly launched by the Syrian government.
After the US strike, Syrian state TV called the assault an "aggression" and both Russia and Syria had denied that the Syrian government launched the chemical weapons attack.
The Russian government also condemned the US strike against the Syrian government as "aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law."
After the incident, Trump told reporters last month that the United States is "not getting along with Russia at all" and the relations between the two countries "may be at an all-time low.
Vincent C. McDonald is talking about the advantages of commercial weather service in Beijing, April 26, 2017. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
Weather information is valuable asset, as it allows individuals to plan ahead, organizing their days around how it is going to look outside.
Vincent C McDonald, chief international strategy officer (CISO) for AccuWeather, said he was proud to provide exact forecasting information to the people in China. He added that staff working for the company's forecasting app, Weather China, were also trained in reading climate changes and industry specifics.
In China, the commercial meteorological service market size would be worth 10 billion yuan, Chinese edition of Bloomberg Businessweek said in 2014.
The commercial meteorological service output was only $600 million in 2015, and, according to a report by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the value of a customized meteorological service in China would surpass 200 billion yuan.
As the commercial meteorological service market continues to be promising, a range of weather-related specialists have been attracted to work in China – including Huafeng-AccuWeather, a weather information service provider, formed by Huafeng meteorological media Group and the world leading commercial weather service company, AccuWeather.
According to the company, it has established partnerships with exclusive smartphone venders – such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Samsung – in order to provide climate change information to technological users around the nation.
Huafeng-AccuWeather, supported by AccuWeather and the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), has since expanded the service available, providing quality information about early weather warnings, and on-the-spot and daily weather predictions. The company also provides customized information to clients, located in specific parts or streets in China.
"We can't control the weather, but we can know what it is going to be like and how it is going to affect our decisions", Vincent said.
As more hospitals mine big data to improve services and tackle illnesses, the central government has vowed to safeguard patients' personal information with a new regulation on how this data can be collected, stored and used.
Data used for analysis by the healthcare industry include people's basic medical condition, general physical condition, disease control and prevention, food safety issues, lifestyle and even genome.
However, "this big data concerns public health and national biological security", according to Jin Xiaotao, vice-minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission. "Regulation is necessary," he said, "especially given that China seeks to develop healthcare data as an asset."
The regulation, which Jin said will be released soon, will define the basics of how big data related to health and medical care can be collected, managed and used, and who can be involved.
A management committee independent from government agencies related to the big data industry will be set up to safeguard data security, he said.
Li Tao, head of the commission's development and research center, said the regulation will help address the safety and privacy concerns surrounding data management.
Left unregulated, the industry might lead to leakage of individual health information for sale to unscrupulous businesses and affect the victims' daily life negatively, he said.
For instance, a pregnant woman might receive advertisements from baby product companies after having "her information sold by someone at the hospital where she went". In extreme cases, the leakage of health data, particularly the genome and medical record, might lead to potential discrimination in the job market and insurance applications, he added.
The planned regulation comes after the State Council issued a multidepartment guideline in June aimed at promoting and regulating the use of big data to improve healthcare.
By 2020, a centralized, authorized and uniform health and medical care big data platform is expected to be established. It will handle data collection and storage, reporting and security management, according to the guideline.
"Improving people's health will be central among the goals of such a system," Jin said.
In addition, Jin stressed that improvements in health would also play a key role in fostering a new economic pillar as a result of big data applications.
State-level development strategy sets out the establishment of a national big data center for health and seven regional centers as well as data research and innovation centers looking at specific areas, such as cancer, he said.
These research centers will be set up with partner institutions and companies from home and abroad, Jin said, adding, "We will be open to applications from all over the world."
Liao Jieyuan, CEO of WeDoctor Group, a major online healthcare provider in China, said the big data development would lay the foundation for medical artificial intelligence and its clinical use, particularly in hard-to-reach rural areas where quality medical resources are harder to access.
In March, WeDoctor donated 100 million yuan ($14.5 million) to help establish a medical AI research center at Zhejiang University committed to big data mining, analysis and transformation to help with clinical treatment.
Jin said the center's launch on March 25 shows that medical AI is a leading development in the progress of medical science.


WELLINGTON, New Zealand - They may not have lost themselves in the music or the moment but a judge and nine lawyers in a New Zealand courtroom did listen politely to Eminem's Lose Yourself as a copyright trial involving the country's ruling political party began on Monday.

The Detroit-based music publishers for Eminem are suing New Zealand's conservative National Party, alleging the rapper's acclaimed 2002 song was copied in the party's soundtrack for a TV ad aired during its successful 2014 election campaign. Titled Eminem Esque, the track has the familiar urgent, pulsing beat of Eminem's song.





The party has previously said it purchased the track through an Australian-based supplier and doesn't believe it has infringed anyone's copyright.

In 2014, when the case was filed, lawmaker Steven Joyce said he thought the use of the song was "pretty legal", and that Eminem's team "are just having a crack and a bit of an eye for the main chance because it's an election campaign." That response was widely ridiculed, including by comedian John Oliver on his show Last Week Tonight.

"Pretty legal? That's not a concept that exists. That's like being sort-of dead," Oliver joked on the show.

Spokespeople for both Joyce and the National Party said on Monday they wouldn't be commenting while the case was before the court.





Garry Williams, the lawyer for Eminem's music publishers Eight Mile Style and Martin Affiliated, quoted from National Party emails, including one in which the song is described as an Eminem "sound-alike" and another in which an agent for the party wrote "I guess the question we're asking, if everyone thinks it's Eminem, and it's listed as Eminem Esque, how can we be confident that Eminem doesn't say we're ripping him off?"

Williams said the emails showed it was "utterly clear" the party knew it was using a copyrighted song.

Speaking outside the court, Joel Martin, a spokesman for Eminem's music publishers, said: "The bottom line is we would never have permitted the use of the song in any political advertisement," he said.

The judge-only trial is expected to last about six days.

The total revenue and net profit of listed A-share companies in 2016 registered double-digit year-on-year growth as supply-side structural reform deepened and many upstream companies reduced overcapacity.
All 3,204 companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses completed releasing their annual reports by April 30.
The revenue of the listed companies totaled 32.5 trillion yuan ($4.7 trillion) last year, increasing 10.2 percent year-on-year; their net profit totaled 2.8 trillion yuan, increasing 11.2 percent year-on-year, according to Choice, an information service provider owned by Eastmoney.com.
A total of 2,195 A-share companies in 2016 achieved positive net profit growth year-on-year, and 620 saw their net profit double.
"The good result was achieved because of China's supply-side structural reform and improvements in the global economy," said Li Shuguang, a law professor at China University of Political Science and Law, who is specialized in the stock market.
Li said China pushed forward with reduction of overcapacity, destocking and deleveraging, which was good for listed companies, especially upstream companies in the coal and steel industries.
Companies in upstream and midstream industries such as coal, steel, chemical, construction and building materials, made the largest improvement in business performance. For example, A-share listed steel companies made a loss in the first quarter of last year and became profitable in the following three quarters.
Dong Dengxin, a finance professor at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, said upstream companies such as in the coal and steel industries effectively reduced overcapacity with policy encouragement in the second half of 2016.
"But they will again face the challenge of overcapacity this year," said Dong.
The net profit growth of companies in industries, such as mechanical equipment, public utilities and finance declined in 2016.
The performance of listed companies on the main board of the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses was steady and good, and the revenue and net profit of companies on the small and medium-sized enterprise board and ChiNext board achieved high growth.
The revenue of main board companies last year totaled 28.7 trillion yuan, increasing 6.7 percent year-on-year; their net profit totaled 2.4 trillion yuan, increasing 4.3 percent year-on-year.
The revenue of SME board companies in 2016 increased 22.4 percent comparing with that in 2015, and their net profit increased 36 percent year-on-year.
ChiNext board companies achieved 33.2 percent growth in revenue and 36.7 percent growth in net profit.
Dong said the first-quarter performance of Chinese A-share listed companies in 2017 would be weaker than their overall performance in 2016 because of the new pressure on upstream companies and the slow growth of the Chinese banking industry.
Hong Hao, chief strategist at BOCOM International Ltd, said the revenue and net profit of Chinese listed companies would see slower growth in 2017, but internet companies with new technology would be bright spots in the economy.








VIENNA - "Vienna til I die!" chanted the fans, in accented English, at a recent rainy match, testament to the British roots of Austria's oldest soccer club: the once-mighty First Vienna FC 1894.

But while the few hundred die-hard supporters give it their all week in week out, the now dilapidated terraces of what was once continental Europe's biggest stadium may soon fall silent for ever.

In March the 123-year-old club, which even under the Nazis was allowed to keep its English name "Vienna", declared itself insolvent and is trying to hammer out a survival plan.

The players haven't been paid since December and automatic relegation looms from Austria's already lowly third division, the Austrian Regional League East, making finding new sponsors even harder.

"If it all ends, it will be the end of an era," sighed Robert Haidinger, head of the supporters club, as he charged 5 euros ($5.50) for the trickle of cars arriving for the evening match.

"A piece of Viennese history would disappear," he said.





Like elsewhere in Europe and beyond in the late 19th century, British immigrants were a major driving force in the birth of Austrian football.

The "Vienna" was founded, in a pub, in 1894 by British gardeners together with locals smitten with this exotic new combination of exercise and gentlemanly "fair play".

The club quickly became an all-Austrian affair but its three-legged logo, the triskelion, still survives in tribute to the homeland of one of the founders, William Beale from the Isle of Man.

To this day many of the chants on the terraces are in English. "Hey ho let's go," says a sign, in English, on the way out of the ground.

Slow decline

"To hear lots of voices singing all together something like 'Come on Vienna' is, well, it gives you goose bumps," said Josef Keglevic, a lifelong fan.

"Vienna" used to be a force to be reckoned with not only in domestic football but internationally too. Visiting Spain in 1925, they thrashed Barcelona 4-1.

But a slow decline started in the mid-1950s and in 1992 the club slipped out of the Bundesliga top league for the final time.

Despite the financial woes, Keglevic, a supporter since he was 6 years old, said "Vienna" still has something special.

"At clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich ... there is no humanity any more. There as a supporter you are just a number, a revenue generator," he said.

"But here there is something, a feeling ... A soul, yes."

BEIJING - China's leading on-demand mobility platform Didi Chuxing announced Friday that it had completed a new financing round of more than $5.5 billion to support its global strategy and continued investments in artificial intelligence (AI).
Didi will continue to work with global communities and partners to offer more innovative mobility services, and expand smart urban transportation programs to build an efficient and sustainable global mobility ecosystem, the company said in a statement.
Didi is expanding overseas and entered the Brazilian market in partnership with a local company in January.
With the launch of Didi Labs in Mountain View, California earlier this year, the company aims to attract more talent and explore new investment opportunities.
Champ survives brutal knockdown to finally finish off Klitschko in 11th
LONDON - Anthony Joshua wasn't wrong when he raised his hands in victory after decking Wladimir Klitschko in the fifth round of their heavyweight title fight in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.
He was just celebrating a little too early.
The rookie mistake allowed Klitschko to rally, as the two 6-foot-6 sluggers took a classic battle to the 11th round - four more than any Joshua fight had ever gone.

That's when Joshua unleashed a vicious uppercut that spun Klitschko around, leading to a TKO triumph that set off nationwide celebrations in Britain and cemented the 27-year-old's status as boxing's new superstar.
Klitschko, who had barely thrown any power punches over the first five rounds, decked Joshua in the sixth with a brutal textbook straight right.
With an entire country screaming for him to get up, Joshua - who had KO'd all his previous 18 opponents by the seventh round - rose at the count of three and weathered the storm until the bell.
Klitschko didn't go down after the big uppercut in the 11th, but Joshua was all over the stunned former champ and finally dropped him with a left hook.
Klitschko got up, only to be sent crashing to the canvas again after absorbing a six-punch flurry.
Klitschko had his hands down and was taking unanswered punches to the head when referee David Fields moved in to stop the fight with 35 seconds left in the 11th.
At the time of the stoppage, Joshua was ahead 96-93 and 95-93 on two scorecards, while Klitschko led 95-93 on the third.
"When you go to the trenches, that's when you find out who you really are," Joshua said.
"In this small little ring here, there's nowhere to hide."
Klitschko's effort was inspiring. After dropping Joshua in the sixth, he gave no quarter until the stoppage, repeatedly scoring with counter rights while coping with a nasty cut above his right eye.
The Ukrainian, who reigned over the heavyweight division for a decade, was fighting both Joshua and Father Time at the age of 41. He looked to be over-matched in the early rounds, but fought his best after he kissed the canvas in the fifth.
"As I said, I'm not perfect but I'm trying," said Joshua, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist who was fighting for only the 19th time as a pro.
Klitschko, in his 29th world-title fight, seemed to be gaining the upper hand in the later rounds, until the uppercut sent him spinning across the ring.
"It was really sad I didn't make it tonight," Klitschko said. "I was planning to do it. It didn't work. But all respect to Anthony."
Joshua rose to the occasion in a bout that more than lived up to its billing as the best heavyweight matchup in more than a decade.
Klitschko fell to 64-5 in a long career that began in 1996 after he won Olympic gold in Atlanta.
Joshua's promoter, Eddie Hearn, said he now envisages the charismatic champion, who owns the IBF, WBA and IBO titles, emulating his idol, Muhammad Ali, by showcasing his talent around the globe.
Unbeaten Deontay Wilder (38-0, 37 KO) of the US owns the WBC title while New Zealand's Joseph Parker (22-0, 18 KO) is the WBO champion.
Hearn has plans for Joshua to light up new venues in China, the Middle East and possibly Africa.
"In terms of worldwide stardom, I told him, 'You win this fight and you become the biggest star in British sport and the biggest star in world boxing'," Hearn said.
"Yet there's so much more improvement to come. By consolidating the championship, I think we have completed phase two of the four phases in AJ's career."
Next, he said, would be big-money defenses around the globe.
"The plan, rather than just keep going in the UK, is to explore and break new markets and boundaries - like the Middle East and China," Hearn said.
"I could see AJ fighting in the Bird's Nest in Beijing and maybe in Africa. I want to go worldwide with him.
"He wants to do what Ali did. That's his inspiration."

WASHINGTON - The White House said on Monday US President Donald Trump's meeting with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong-un is unlikely in the near future despite Trump's openness to that possibility.
"We are so early into this process that I don't see this happening any time soon," said White House spokesman Sean Spicer at the daily briefing, adding that conditions for such a meeting have not been met yet.
"We've got to see their provocative behavior ratchet down immediately. Those are a lot of conditions that I think would have to happen with respect to its behavior," said Spicer. "Clearly, conditions are not there right now."
Earlier on Monday, Trump told Bloomberg that he would meet Kim Jong Un "under the right circumstances."
"If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it," Trump said. "If it's under the, again, under the right circumstances. But I would do that."
Tension has remained very high over the past two months between the United States and the DPRK over the former's threat to stage military attack upon Pyongyang for its nuclear and missile programs.
The United States and South Korea also held their largest ever joint military exercises in the past two months, while the USS Carl Vinson nuclear aircraft carrier task group has arrived in the waters off the peninsula for joint drills with the South Korean military.


GREENCASTLE, Ireland - For many on the oyster-rich shores of the River Foyle estuary on the northern tip of Ireland, Britain's departure from the European Union cannot come soon enough.

The hope is that Brexit will solve a decades-old sovereignty dispute over the waterway between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

The standoff has led to a boom in the unauthorized cultivation of oysters on Lough Foyle, which licensed Irish oyster farmers say threatens their lucrative export industry.

"After almost 100 years of failing to deal with the issue, Brexit will now force the two sides to settle the issue once and for all," said Seamus Bovaird, a former manager of the Lough Foyle Fishermen's Co-Op.

When Ireland was partitioned in 1921 the main focus was on establishing peace after a bruising war of independence that led to the creation of two states on the island.





Whether by accident or willful neglect, the British government and the newly-created Irish Free State left the ownership of Lough Foyle out of the terms of the negotiated settlement.

Elsewhere along the open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, residents and businesses are concerned that new customs checks will be imposed once Britain is out of the EU.

But on Lough Foyle, Brexit spells greater legal certainty, according to Enda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency, a cross-border body that supervises the waters but has no powers over aquaculture.

"When Brexit comes in it will force the hand of the Irish government because ... the EU will have to ask it where its borders lie and then regulation can be enforced," Craig said.

Four years ago there were 2,000 oyster beds, now the Loughs Agency estimates there are around 30,000.

Only a small fraction have official licenses.

With few employment prospects in the area, many have seized the opportunity created by the territorial spat.

These oyster farmers consider themselves unlicensed rather than illegal but they still shy away from publicity and have consistently refused interviews.

Craig compared the proliferation to the Klondike gold boom in Canada at the end of the 19th century.

"This is the Irish equivalent of the Klondike - a marine gold rush with no enforcement, no guaranteed health and safety supervision or environmental controls," he said.

Traditionally, Irish oysters have been sold for the quality end of the French market, or to Asia.

Richie Flynn, aquaculture executive at the Irish Shellfish Association, said he was "very nervous" about the uncertainty and called for an immediate resolution.

"If it all unravels it would be a disaster for the guys who are doing things right," he said.

CLEVELAND — LeBron James resisted drinking some beer. He downed the Raptors again instead.
James grabbed a bottle of beer on the sideline while scoring 35 points, Kyrie Irving added 24 and the Cleveland Cavaliers picked up where they left off following a long layoff and throttled Toronto 116-105 on Monday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference semifinal.
The Cavs hadn't played since April 23, when they completed a four-game sweep of Indiana. But the defending champions didn't show signs of rust and were well-prepared to face the revenge-seeking Raptors, who lost to Cleveland in last year's conference finals.
"That was the mystery coming into the game, how we would come out?" James said.
"Obviously you prepare, you want to come out and play well, but you never know after an eight-day layoff. But the energy was phenomenal."Toronto dropped to 1-12 in playoff openers, and the Raptors got blown out in the playoffs for the fourth straight time in Cleveland.
Game 2 is Wednesday night.
Kyle Lowry scored 20 and DeMar DeRozan 19 for the Raptors, who were within seven in the third quarter before James dropped a 3-pointer, converted a three-point play, drained another 3 and then considered washing down a brew — a moment he said wasn't planned.
After drawing a foul on a missed layup, James playfully hopped toward the sideline, where a courtside server was passing by. The three-time champion reached and grabbed a beer bottle from her hand and brought it toward his lips before putting it back.
"I wasn't going to run over our beer lady," he said. "She had one and I grabbed it. I'm not a beer guy. If she had some red wine I would have probably taken a sip."With trade acquisitions Serge Ibaka and P.J. Tucker, this Toronto team seemed better equipped to beat Cleveland than the one which lost in six games in last year's playoffs.
Trouble is, James only seems to be getting better and the Cavs are gaining speed.
"They were well-rested, flying around — almost like a half a step quicker than we were all night," said Toronto coach Dwane Casey. "We've got to make adjustments as far as how we want to guard the paint and then get out to the 3. Offensively, get cleaner looks."Before the game, Casey talked about the big comebacks that have been a theme in these playoffs. The Raptors blew a 25-point lead to Milwaukee in the first round, while the Cavs overcame a 25-point deficit and pulled off the biggest second-half rally in playoff history.
"There's no lead safe in the NBA," he said.
That's what happened to the Cavs in the first half as they built an 18-point lead only to watch the Raptors go on a 19-3 burst to pull within 41-39.
But Cleveland regrouped and, playing a turnover-free second quarter, led 62-48 at half.
James' legs looked fresh early on as he and Irving teamed up on a stunning alley-oop.
After he poked the ball away for a steal, James took off up the floor with Irving on the break. James pointed toward the backboard and Irving understood the message, bouncing a pass high off the glass that James grabbed and dunked with his left hand.
TIP-INSRaptors: Have lost last four postseason games in Cleveland by an average 24.7 points. ... G Norman Powell appeared to intentionally hit Kevin Love in the groin area, a play that could come under league review. Later, Powell was assessed a technical for jawing with Cavs G Dahntay Jones, who was ejected and will be fined. ... Toronto's lone win in a playoff opener came in 2001.
Cavaliers: G/F J.R. Smith banged his surgically repaired right thumb in the first half. He said the team's medical staff told him there was no structural damage. ... James needs 25 points to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5,762 points) for second place on the league's postseason scoring list, and two 3-pointers to join Ray Allen, Reggie Miller and Manu Ginobili as the only players to connect on 300 postseason 3s. ... James has scored at least 30 in 88 playoff games, tying Kobe Bryant for second on the career list.
Only Michael Jordan (109) has more.
IRVING'S DIMES
Irving had a playoff career-high 10 assists after getting just 12 in the entire series against Indiana. None was as memorable as his leave for James.
"It's just another play in the books for me and Bron," he said.
THE WHOLE TRUTHJames had some memorable playoff matchups with Paul Pierce, who played his last game on Sunday when the Los Angeles Clippers were eliminated by Utah.
The 39-year-old Pierce played 19 seasons, and as far as James is concerned, he should be on his way to basketball immortality.
"He put his mark on this game," James said. "Somebody I've always respected and competed against and pushed me in the Eastern Conference for quite a while. A champion. His numbers and what he was able to do out on the floor speaks for itself. So I would say his next stop is the Hall of Fame. He had a hell of a ride for sure."UP NEXTThe Cavs are 16-1 at home against Eastern teams in the playoffs since 2015.

SHEFFIELD, England - Defending champion Mark Selby came back from 10-4 down to beat four-time winner John Higgins 18-15 to take the title of the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible here on Monday.
The 33-year-old Selby, who lifted the trophy in 2014 and 2016, became the fourth player after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan to win back-to-back titles since 1977.
Scotland's Higgins, 41, surrendered the early lead and trailed 13-11 after Monday afternoon's third session. Selby extended his lead to 16-12 before Higgins made an impressive late rally to narrow the gap to 16-15. But in the end he was no match for his unflappable and determined opponent.
Selby also pocketed the biggest prize in snooker history of 375,000 pounds and smashed Hendry's long-standing record of 740,000 pounds for the most prize money earned in a single season. Selby has won 932,000 this season.
"It's a fantastic feeling," said Selby. "I was confident coming here because of the season I'd had. I was just taking one frame at a time. When I was 10-4 down yesterday I thought there's no way in the world I was going to come back from that, I was trying to make it respectable. At one stage I was thinking I could lose with a session to spare."
"To get out 10-7, it felt like I was leading. I don't know how I managed to win those three frames, because before that I was shattered. My game was all over the place, missing ball after ball, making it easy for John. The harder I was trying the worse it got. I managed to nick those three frames and that gave me confidence. I think John went to bed that night thinking he'd let one go," Selby said.
"It is such a hard tournament to win physically and mentally. Snooker is one of the toughest sports in the world. There's only four players that have ever defended it and you look at the greats who have played the game," he added.
Higgins won a runner-up prize of 160,000 pounds and moved up to number two in world rankings.
"I think Mark will add to that, whether it's one, two, three or four," said Higgins. "He looks as though he could be the challenger to Stephen Hendry's seven world titles. He's just granite and really tough to play against, so I take my hat off to him. It's up to the likes of Robertson, Trump and Ding to challenge him. They'll be watching that tonight and it will make them desperate to get back on the practice table," Higgens predicted.
"I'm delighted to have got to the final. It's just a pity I couldn't go one better, but I'm proud of myself," he concluded.

SOCHI, Russia - Formula One heads home after four opening long-haul races with the championship finely balanced between champions Mercedes and Ferrari and the prospect of an intense battle stretching out ahead.
With the European season proper starting in Spain next week, and teams promising upgrades and a faster pace of development, the two frontrunners return to their factories with two wins apiece.
Mercedes have a one point lead in the constructors' championship while Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, with two wins and two second places, is 13 clear of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton.
"It's going to be extremely close," said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. "More than very.
"They (Ferrari) came out of the winter with a good car and it seems to suit Sebastian a lot. And we just need to stretch ourselves to perform as good as we can," added the Austrian.
So far success has alternated between the two teams, with Vettel winning the opener in Australia, Hamilton in China, Vettel again in Bahrain and Valtteri Bottas taking his career first success in Russia for the team he joined in January.
In 2016, Mercedes were dominant and won all but two of the races with 20 pole positions from 21 starts but resurgent Ferrari -- who won nothing -- have already recast the 2017 landscape.
Vettel's pole in Sochi was Ferrari's first since 2015 and the front row lockout the first grid since 2008 with both red cars at the front.
There can be no doubt now that the sport's oldest and most successful team are back with a vengeance.
The split between the Mercedes drivers has favored Vettel, whose own Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen has scored 49 points to the German's 86 while Hamilton and Bottas are separated by just 10.
Red Bull are a distant third at present, with Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo fifth and sixth in the standings, but they too could get back into the mix if impending upgrades to their engine and chassis are as good as they hope.
"I think it will be a very close race between Mercedes and us...and I also hope that Red Bull find some pace," said Vettel, who won his four world championships with that team before joining Ferrari.
"There's lots of rumors around. They are a strong team, they know how to build a quick car so I expect it's a question of when rather than if. But the sooner, the more exciting it will be for us."
Verstappen won for Red Bull in Spain last year, his first career victory, after Hamilton and now-retired team mate Nico Rosberg collided on the first lap and nobody is taking anything for granted now.
"Everybody will come with upgrades for Barcelona," Mercedes' non-executive chairman Niki Lauda told reporters.
"The season will start anew and then who has the better upgrades, and makes the quicker car, we don't know yet. We will see in Barcelona and practice and then the race," added the Austrian.

New measure will see greater certainty in financial planning and remove elements of fate
As a traditional Chinese saying goes, "Farmers mainly depend on heaven or the weather for food."
Areas hit by severe disasters can see their whole year of hard work swept away.
To combat the winds of fate, the upcoming policy to establish an agricultural insurance system in piloting regions will soon help farmers to tackle the uncertainty.
The State Council's executive meeting on April 26 decided to push forward government implementation of the system by launching pilot zones to improve the overall disaster insurance in agriculture.
This aims to further enhance insurance in the agricultural sector to boost supply-side reform in agriculture and increase farmers' incomes.
According to a statement after the meeting, disaster insurance will be provided in 13 major grain-producing provinces, with insurance covering material costs and land rental impacted by disaster. Meanwhile, the government will also increase the subsidy for insurance payments in the pilot counties.
Zheng Fengtian, professor of agriculture and rural development at Renmin University of China, believes this insurance subsidy will encourage farmers to boost output due to the greater financial security.
"Previously, when a region's farming land was hit by natural disasters, farmers largely depended on government subsidy to compensate their loss," Zheng explained.
"Now, as 13 piloting regions will be covered by the government-backed insurance, this means financial subsidies for farmers in case of disasters will be more systematic, and the amount of insurance payouts will be evaluated in a more professional way."
Farmers, he added, will no longer be burdened by worries over natural disasters.
Zheng said that as most commercial insurance is profit-oriented, losses incurred in case of disasters have long become a tough balancing act between insurance groups and the government.
He believes the move will encourage farmers to grow more, especially grain, because profits in cultivating grain was traditionally much lower than for cash crops.
South Koreans protest against the deployment of the THAAD system near US Embassy in Seoul on Saturday. Ahn Youngjoon / Associated Press
President Donald Trump said South Korea should pay the $1 billion cost
SEOUL - Protests against the deployment of the US THAAD missile defense system continued in South Korea on Monday amid a controversy over which side would shoulder its $1 billion cost.
About 150 residents and peace activists blocked the entrance of police buses to a golf course in Seongju in the southeastern part of the country, where major elements of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system have already been installed.
The protesters blocked police buses in a bid to stop US troops from bringing in more equipment to the site.
Two oil tankers, driven by US soldiers, attempted on Sunday to enter the golf course, but were blocked by the protesters. During the tussle with police, two people were wounded and were taken to a nearby hospital.
Sim Sang-jung of the progressive Justice Party, one of the five major presidential candidates, visited the Soseong-ri village in Seongju on Sunday to talk with the residents. During the meeting, Sim, who has called for the reversal of the THAAD deployment, said the other candidates should also come to the site and watch what was taking place in Seongju, which she described as "war-like situations".
In Seoul, three Won Buddhist monks launched an indefinite hunger strike at Gwanghwamun Square, vowing to fast until THAAD is completely pulled of out South Korea.
Major THAAD elements, including two launchers and a radar, were installed last week following a violent tussle between police and protesters.
Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted over who would pay for the missile defense system after US President Donald Trump said last week South Korea should bear the $1 billion cost.
The comment sparked fresh protests against the THAAD deployment because the shield would be operated by the US Forces Korea, not by South Korea's military.
Herbert McMaster, US national security adviser, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that his country would adhere to the deal with South Korea on THAAD "until any renegotiation," indicating a renegotiation on which side would pay the cost.
The South Korean Defense Ministry said on Monday that paying the THAAD cost could not become a subject to renegotiations, reiterating that the costs issue was already agreed upon.
Under the Status of Forces Agreement, the ministry claimed, the US side bears the burden of the THAAD operation and maintenance, while the South Korean side provides land and infrastructure for the deployment.
Debates were rekindled among major South Korean presidential candidates over the THAAD installation, following Trump's remarks on the payment.
Moon Jae-in of the biggest Minjoo Party, a months-long frontrunner in recent presidential polls, reiterated his position: "The final decision on THAAD must be made by the next government."
The country's presidential election is scheduled for May 9 as former President Park Geun-hye was impeached in March over corruption allegations.
Ahn Cheol-soo of the minor centrist People's Party, a runner-up to Moon, said the costs should be paid by the US side.

BARCELONA, Spain - Real Madrid again made light of the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo as it crushed Deportivo la Coruna 6-2 to maintain the upper hand in the La Liga title race on Wednesday.
Madrid and Barcelona are locked on 78 points at the top of the standings, but Real has a game in hand over its title rival.
Barca remains on top thanks to its better head-to-head record as Lionel Messi struck twice to relegate Osasuna in a 7-1 thrashing.
Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane made nine changes from the lineup that lost 3-2 to Barca on Sunday to reignite the title race.
Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and the injured Gareth Bale were left off the Madrid roster for a third straight away league game, but again their absence wasn't missed.
"It is the hardest job for a coach. When they play like they did today, then maybe they won't play in the next game," said Zidane.
"We know I have a phenomenal group of players and all of them are ready for the challenge between now and the end of the season."
Alvaro Morata smashed home at the near post to give Real the perfect start after less than a minute.
James Rodriguez then added a second from Lucas Vazquez's cross as the visitor threatened to run riot inside the first 20 minutes.
However, the European champion has now managed just one shutout in its past 15 games as its defense was breached once more when Florin Andone turned home Gael Kakuta's misfire 10 minutes before the break.
'Thank you, Leo!'

SHEFFIELD, England - China's Ding Junhui was stopped by defending champion Mark Selby 17-15 in a thrilling semifinal at the World Snooker Championship on Saturday.
World number four Ding, who upset five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in the quarterfinals, lost to Selby again following last year's defeat in the final, which finished 18-14.
The two players were deadlocked at 12-12 going into the fourth session and it was Selby who made the first move with breaks of 74 and 96 to go 14-12 ahead.
Ding made a 52 in winning the next and had a clear chance in frame 28 but missed a red to a top corner when trailing 34-41. Selby eventually took the frame on the colours to lead 15-13 at the interval.
In frame 29, Ding led 42-11 when he was unlucky not to split a cluster of reds in potting the pink. Selby made 42 then trapped his opponent in a snooker on the yellow which yielded the chance to go 16-13 ahead.
Ding hit back to take the next two frames with a top run of 73 to close to 16-15. And he had two scoring chances early in frame 32 but scored just nine points, missing a red and then a blue to a center pocket. His second error proved his last shot as Selby made a flawless 72.
Selby, who won the champion in 2014 and 2016, will now face John Higgins over 35 frames on Sunday and Monday for the famous trophy and 375,000-pound top prize. It's a repeat of the 2007 final which Higgins won 18-13.
Ding said after the match: "If I hadn't missed that blue it would definitely have gone to a final frame. Mark played well in the end. I should have won more frames and taken my chances earlier in the session. I had too many mistakes but that is what happens.
"I can see myself improving a lot, I played with more confidence and more aggression. The fans need to see more snooker like that. They want to see fast snooker and centuries. I'm happy with how I did this time.
"I'm disappointed to lose when I played well, but sometimes you have to take it, because it is sport. I've got more experience here, I'm just over 30 and there is still a long way to go and many years left here. I believe next year will be good."
Selby spoke highly of the Chinese star, "I was over the moon to come out 12-12 last night because I thought Ding probably deserved the lead. He scored better than me, he played great, his safety was good, he had three centuries last night. All that you're asking for is to be going into that final session with a chance.
"This year he knew what to expect on the one table set up and I thought he played fantastic. It was only one or two balls here and there that was the difference between me winning or him winning. As a player he's matured, as a person he's matured, his temperament around the table is fantastic. It's only a matter of time before he comes here and wins it."
"It was a great game to be involved in. Ding missed that blue in the last frame, I had resigned myself to going 16-16.
China is to issue its first regulation on how the big data from the health sector is collected, stored and used.
Jin Xiaotao, vice-minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said the regulation will be issued soon, as the nation aims to safeguard public security.
Big data for the health industry includes patients' basic information and conditions, disease control and prevention, food safety, lifestyles and even genomes.
"This data concerns public health and national biological security," Jin said. "The new regulation is necessary, especially given that China seeks to develop healthcare data as an asset."
He said an independent management committee will be set up to ensure data security and that the regulation will define the basic rules on ownership, collection and usage.
The move comes after the State Council issued a multidepartment guideline in June to promote and regulate the use of big data in healthcare.
The guideline states that a centralized, uniform big data platform for healthcare is expected to be established by 2020 to standardize data collection, storage, reporting and security management.
"A central goal of the guideline is to improve people's health," said Jin, whose commission was among the departments that produced the document.
The guideline is also expected to play an important role in building a new economic pillar for China involving the application of big data.
Jin said the State-level strategy includes setting up a national healthcare big data center and seven regional centers as well as data research and innovation centers, which will be established with partner institutions from home and abroad.
Ongoing inspections continue to find violators; 'hot grid' adds another tool
The Ministry of Environmental Protection will put greater emphasis on high-tech satellite monitoring to identify pollution sources efficiently, using a grid system put in place late last year, according to the official in charge of the effort.
Now, the ministry will use its "hot grid" system, based on the satellite technology, to target more polluters - including small, unregistered, scattered companies that are operating illegally, said Li Wei, head of the ministry's department in charge of the grid system.
The satellite inspections will supplement the ongoing national environmental inspections, in which teams on the ground have uncovered violations in 28 major cities of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, as well as in neighboring Henan, Shandong and Shanxi provinces, as of April 30.
The latest data from the Ministry of Environmental Protection show that about 68 percent of the 6,498 companies inspected had pollution problems.
Environmental inspectors have so far found 1,504 small polluting companies - all of which are unregistered and operating illegally - scattered in the northern region, which has seen frequent and severe smog since inspections began on April 7, according to the ministry.
More than 750 companies failed to install or use equipment to reduce emissions.
To locate smaller polluting companies more efficiently, the ministry will employ its advanced "hot grid" system, which helps identify zones where companies or other sources may be excessively discharging pollutants. The grid separates areas into grid squares, each measuring 9 square kilometers.
Emission levels in each area are determined using data collected by satellites.
Inspectors have already been using the hot grid information as a guide to find polluters, but the information will be improved with regular updates to aid inspections, the ministry said.
"We will randomly check the companies in the hot grid, which will become one of our work priorities," said Guo Lubiao, head of the inspection team from Anyang, Henan province, which assumed inspection of Xingtai, Hebei province, on April 21.
"Exposing scattered polluting companies has been one of the priorities in the initial stage of the yearlong inspection," said Tian Weiyong, head of the monitoring department at the ministry. Any small, unregistered operators that are exposed will be shut down, Tian said.
The ministry's list of inspection results, which is released daily, is growing longer.
In Xingtai, inspectors from Qingdao, Shandong province, found 173 violations, 93 of which involved illegally operating small companies not included in the government's shutdown list, said Zhao Peng, the head of the team.

HOHHOT -- Firefighters have put out a fire that extended from Russia to primeval forest in Inner Mongolia autonomous region, north China, authorities said Tuesday.
The fire started in Russia and spread across the border Sunday afternoon to Yimuhe forest in the northern Greater Hinggan Mountains, according to local forest administration, adding that the cause of the fire is under investigation.
More than 1,300 firefighters and police had extinguished the fire by 11:21 pm Monday. Steps are now being taken to prevent the fire reigniting, according to the administration.
This spring, the temperature in Inner Mongolia is 1 to 2 degrees Celsius higher than the average over previous years, increasing the fire risk as the region's forests are particularly dry.

BEIJING -- One month after the advent of Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, people have seen signs of a promising future for the area.
INTENSIVE ATTENTION
On April 1, China announced the plan to create the Xiongan New Area, which spans the counties of Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin in Hebei Province, and home to Baiyangdian, a major wetland in northern China.
"The new zone is a golden-lettered signboard," said Guo Yonghong, general manager of a local clothing company, who told Xinhua he had received hundreds of phone calls seeking for cooperation during the last month both from home and abroad.
"The sudden intensive attention made me realize that I must prepare in advance for the upgrading and transformation of my enterprise."
A BLANK SHEET FOR A GORGEOUS DRAWING
Launching of the new area is expected to help phase out some non-capital functions from Beijing, explore a new model of optimized development in densely-populated areas, and restructure the urban layout in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,
The new area will cover around 100 square km initially and be expanded to 200 square km in the mid-term and about 2,000 square km in the long term.
As the national plan kicks in, massive demolition and relocation is inevitable, and local residents and entrepreneurs are concerned about where their old industries will go.
"Relocation of enterprises will be thoughtful and people-centered," said a circular from the preparatory committee of the Xiongan New Area issued on April 12, setting people's mind at rest.
The top priority for Xiongan's smooth start lies in sound environmental protection and early scientific planning and regulation.
Since April 1, people have crowded squares and streets in Xiongxian, Anxin and Rongcheng counties, taking photos, exchanging information and looking for business opportunities.
Against the backdrop of investor speculation and increasing housing prices, the preparatory committee has frozen transactions related to land and property, vowing to crack down on illegal construction and trading of second-hand houses.
The livelihood of local people after relocation is among the central authorities' top concerns.
During the past month, government officials were asked to listen to local residents' appeals and explain policies of the central government.
Ecosystem protection started much earlier.
Guo Hezi, resident of the Wangjiazhai Village, which is surrounded by the Baiyangdian wetland, told Xinhua that pollution treatment had been enhanced in recent years and the quality of water in the lake was gradually improving.
"In October 2015, a giant project diverting water from the Yellow river to the Baiyangdian was launched to improve the ecosystem in the new area," said Zhao Jianmin, a technician with Anxin County's water resources bureau."Upon its completion, 255 million cubic meters of fresh water will be poured into the Baiyangdian each year."
CITY OF THE FUTURE UNDER PLANNING
During his February visit, President Xi Jinping called for "world vision, international standards, Chinese characteristics and high goals" in planning and construction.
The planning of Xiongan is under way and will include one general plan and several specific plans such as Baiyangdian ecological environment protection, social and economic development and industry layout plans.
The planning began about one year ago, and now the China Academy of Urban Planning & Design and five other institutions are working on improving Xiongan's general plan and the regulatory plan of its starting area.
The detailed regulatory plan and urban design of the 30-square-kilometer starting area of Xiongan will be open for global bidding, according to local authorities.
If all goes according to plan, the area will have an excellent environment, optimal urban layout, great public services and innovative development.
China will take pioneering steps to turn the plan into reality. There will be a lean, efficient and uniform management body to ensure reforms in land use, environmental protection and public service and diverse ways of financing instead of just selling land.
The government will also introduce high-quality education and technological innovation resources into the new area and try to attract major projects such as national laboratories.
The Xiongan New Area's priority will be to serve as a new home for Beijing's "non-capital" functions, which will receive some of Beijing's administrative organs, large enterprises, financial institutions, colleges and research institutions.
Many players are echoing the call. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council announced it would encourage state firms to support development of the area.
Telecom giants China Mobile and China Telecom declared that they would make sure Xiongan was covered by a 5G network ahead of many other places in the country. China Development Bank, a state-owned policy bank, said it would soon provide loans of 130 billion yuan ($18.9 billion dollars) to support Xiongan's development.
"With the support of the whole country, the Xiongan New Area will become an innovative development model featuring the government's new growth philosophy and we will see a more coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region," said Zhao Kezhi, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

MONACO — To sell or not to sell is the question soon facing Monaco.
Monaco has a summer of tough decision-making ahead — even more so if it wins the Champions League. The 2004 runner-up faces Juventus in the first leg of the semifinals on Wednesday: the toughest test of a thrilling season that has seen Monaco score 146 goals in all competitions.
Monaco's young players have made such an impression — particularly striker Kylian Mbappe — that offers will be flooding in when the transfer window reopens. In the Principality famed for its casino, Monaco will have to choose whether or not to cash in its chips this summer and rake in a huge amount.
"We don't need to sell, our budget is stable," Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev recently told football show Telefoot. "For the time being, no player has said he wants to leave. Ahead of the 2018 World Cup, neither Thomas (Lemar), Kylian or perhaps Bernardo Silva wants to leave ... We'll do everything to keep them."It sounds like reassuring news, but any club wishing to sign the 18-year-old Mbappe will need to make a massive offer. The newly-capped France forward's estimated value is already at 100 million euros ($110 million) and it's not hard to see why.
At the age of 18 years and four months, he is the youngest to reach 15 league goals in Europe's top five leagues since former Golden Ball winner Michael Owen for Liverpool in 1998; the youngest to have reached five goals in the Champions League, and the first player to score in each of the first four Champions League knockout rounds he played in.
Mbappe has netted 24 goals this season, including 18 in his last 18 — and he was playing in the reserves until November. His powerful running, skill, sheer pace, and cool finishing make him a mix between Thierry Henry and Brazil great Ronaldo.
In fact, he is so popular in France that even opposing fans from Lyon and Caen applauded him off the field when he played there.
Only a few clubs can realistically afford him: Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City, United and Juventus.
It puts Monaco in a precarious position, and one they have been in before for different reasons.
In the summer of 2015, because of former Financial Fair Play rules designed to control club finances, Monaco needed to raise money and sold the heart of its team.
Forward Anthony Martial joined Manchester United in a deal rising to 80 million euros ($88 million), while midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia, winger Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, center half Aymen Abdenour and left back Layvin Kurzawa were all sold — raising about 200 million euros ($220 million) altogether. This followed the sale of Colombia's star forward James Rodriguez to Real Madrid for around 80 million euros the previous summer.
Monaco's finances are far better now and the club will likely not sell more than one or two players this summer. This increases the chances of Mbappe staying as the main striker next season, should Radmael Falcao leave after turning down three offers from Chinese clubs in January.
Here is a look at some of Monaco's other sought-after players.
THOMAS LEMAR
The fleet-footed attacking midfielder has 13 goals this season, including fine strikes home and away against Tottenham in the Champions League group stage.
Along with excellent technical ability, the 21-year-old Lemar also has pace and is an intelligent passer.
While Bernardo Silva roams down the right, Lemar marauds down the left, making it doubly hard for teams to defend the flanks.
Barcelona is among the clubs reportedly interested in signing the France international.
Estimated market value: 40 million euros ($44 million).
BENJAMIN MENDYA powerful, athletic left back, Mendy is also dangerous going forward and especially with first-time crosses into the penalty area at pace.
Although the 22-year-old Mendy rarely scores, the way he combines with Lemar down the left is one of Monaco's biggest strengths.
Mendy's speed and strength already makes him hard to stop. But in addition, he has excellent technique for a defender.
Estimated market value: 30 million euros ($33 million).
BERNARDO SILVA
Silva is a playmaker, a scorer, a tireless runner and a tricky winger rolled into one. No wonder he is among the most coveted young attacking midfielders in Europe.
With his lithe frame, nippy speed and wide passing range, Silva is a menace wherever he receives the ball. When he drifts in from the right to take up a more central position, he becomes a probing No. 10 and his eye for a subtle threaded pass perfectly suits the cunning runs of Falcao and the direct runs of Mbappe.
The 22-year-old Portugal international has nine goals this season, including two in the group stages. But he sometimes pays the price for being so unselfish and hasn't scored since Feb. 17 — a run of 17 matches.
He will be keen to end that lean spell against Juventus.
Estimated market value: 60 million euros ($66 million).
TIEMOUE BAKAYOKO
One of Monaco's most consistent players, Bakayoko is a pillar in front of a sometimes vulnerable defense.
The 22-year-old defensive midfielder is also an astute reader of the game and keeps Monaco ticking with his quick passing out from the back: making him the ideal launch pad for their attacks and the perfect safety net should those attacks break down.
Bakayoko is a threat from set pieces, too, sending Monaco through to the quarterfinals with a towering late header in the return leg against Manchester City.
His immense physical strength and energetic running makes him ideally suited to the Premier League, with Manchester United among his many admirers.
Estimated market value: 30 million euros.

Asia's largest refiner Sinopec announced its preliminary listing plan for its marketing arm on Thursday, a move to further open up the country's energy markets.
Sinopec, the listed arm of China Petrochemical Corporation, also known as Sinopec Group, announced that it has approved the overseas listing of its majority-owned subsidiary Sinopec Marketing Co Ltd on Thursday evening to "further deepen the reform of systems and mechanisms, enhance the competitiveness and the overall enterprise value of the company."
The preliminary plan remains subject to approval by Sinopec Marketing's board of directors and shareholders, as well as by domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, including the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, it said.
"Sinopec announced the introduction of private capital into our oil product marketing business in February 2014, the first among our peers to do so," said Zhang Haichao, deputy general manager of Sinopec and chairman of Sinopec Marketing.
"The planned overseas listing of Sinopec Marketing marks another major milestone in our efforts to fully diversify the ownership of the marketing business, and will accelerate its strategic transformation from an oil product marketer to a comprehensive service provider."
According to the company, the number of overseas-listed shares to be issued will be 10 percent of the total share capital after issuance.
The final offering price will be negotiated and determined together by Sinopec Marketing's board of directors.
Proceeds raised from the listing will be used to boost the development of the issuer's primary businesses, as well as optimizing the asset-liabilities structure, it said.
The company will retain a majority shareholding in Sinopec Marketing upon completion of the overseas listing.
Sinopec Marketing is expected to continuously improve its profitability, and the profit of Sinopec Marketing attributable to the company is expected to increase, which will help improve the overall financial performance of the company.
Sinopec Marketing is primarily engaged in storage and logistics, retail sales, direct sales and distribution of petroleum products such as refined oil products, natural gas for automobile and fuel oil, as well as development and operation of emerging business, including convenience stores, e-commerce and auto services.

LONDON - Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday visited an elephant reserve in England prior to its opening to the public and came face to face with the herd's youngest member named after her.
The 10-month-old female calf was born in June and was named Elizabeth in honor of the Queen's 90th birthday.
The baby elephant, her mom Karishma and nine other Asian elephants will share a new extensive paddock at Whipsnade Zoo, run by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL).
Asian elephants are considered endangered due to habitat loss, poaching and human conflict.
The new home for the herd has seven linked outside areas, including a large grass paddock and two separate houses. Additional facilities include pools, mud wallows, dust baths and rubbing posts and high feeders.
The queen, accompanied by Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh, fed a banana to one of the elephants.
Professor David Field, a director at ZSL, said the queen was absolutely delighted to learn that the calf, now weighing 460 kg, was named after her.
Zookeepers at Whipsnade described the baby elephant as very playful.




One zookeeper commented, "she even has a football which she takes everywhere and gets stroppy if it is taken away from her."
Assistant curator of elephants at Whipsnade Lee Sambrook said the queen was especially interested to hear about the round-the-clock care the elephants receive.
The queen is a patron of ZSL, which carried out animal conservation work around the world.

CHANGSHA - China's Aier Eye Hospital announced the purchase of Spain's Clinica Baviera SA, the largest eye clinic group in Europe.
Aier will spend 152 million euros ($161 million) to buy 59.353 percent of shares in Baviera through its subsidiary in Europe, with shares valued at 10.35 euros each.
Chen Bang, chairman of the board of Aier Eye Group, described the purchase as "an important milestone" in the firm's development.
Aier Eye Hospital is China's largest private ophthalmic medical chain institution and went public on the Shenzhen stock market in 2009. By 2016, Aier has developed more than 160 specialized eye hospitals in China.
It acquired a medical group in Hong Kong in 2015 and a US eye center in January 2017.
Baviera, specializing in the laser eye surgery, has nearly 300 ophthalmologists and 76 eye clinics in Europe. Its market share in laser eye surgery ranks first in Spain and Germany.
Official says US waffling on issue has no bearing on what Beijing will do
China's special envoy on climate change reaffirmed on Tuesday the nation's commitment to its 2015 Paris pledge, even if domestic policies in the United States change.
"A retreat from the Paris pact may drag down the pace of the US to fulfill its pledges, but it has no impact on China," Xie Zhenhua, a veteran climate change negotiator who has participated in United Nations climate change conferences, said at a news conference after the BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change closed in Beijing on Tuesday.
The BASIC countries refer to four emerging economies sharing similar stances on climate change actions - Brazil, South Africa, India and China.
Xie cited remarks made by President Xi Jinping during the Davos Forum in January. Xi said sticking to the Paris agreement is a responsibility we must assume for future generations.
Xie said China is capable of fulfilling its pledges ahead of schedule.
China has pledged to cut its emissions per unit of GDP by 60 percent to 65 percent by 2030 from its 2005 level, according to the Paris pact, which went into effect last year.
Xie's affirmation of China's commitment comes after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week that runs counter to former President Barack Obama's plan to reduce global warming.
Obama pledged to reduce US emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 from its 2005 levels.
Xie said China and other BASIC countries will keep an eye on US foreign policy to address the climate subject, because the world's second largest green gas emitter would have a large impact on the global efforts combating climate change.
"Although Trump promised to pull out of the Paris agreement during his campaign, his administration is now split on whether to keep the pledge," said Barbara Thomson, South Africa's deputy minister of environmental affairs.
"At this stage, the thing we BASIC members can do is to affirm our position in climate change actions," Thomson said. "Our clear attitude may have an impact on US politics and domestic policy."
If the US retreats from the pact, developed countries would need to cover the US funding shortfall, Xie said.
In the Paris Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion in funding by 2020 to help developing countries combat climate change.
Ministers stressed in their joint announcement on Tuesday that developed countries participating in the Paris pact should enhance their financial, technological and other support to developing countries.
Two days after an Asian passenger was forcibly dragged off a United Airlines plane at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and video of the incident spread globally across social media, travel industry and marketing analysts said that United's reputation has been damaged and the incident could have an impact on the carrier in China.
Chinese netizens expressed furor over the incident that occurred on Sunday evening. By Tuesday afternoon the hashtag "United forcibly removes passenger from plane" was the most popular topic on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. It received more than 480 million views and more than 200,000 comments.
Some Chinese social media users accused United of racism and others called for a boycott of the carrier. United began nonstop service to China in 1986 and operates more nonstop US-China flights, and to more cities in China, than any other airline.
Zishi Zhang, an 18-year-old college student in the UK, launched a petition that calls for a federal investigation of United Airlines' actions. It had more than 55,000 signatures of its 100,000 goal. The petition, which claims that United's actions were racial motivated, is trending on social media with the hashtag #ChineseLivesMatter.
Members of Congress also reacted to the incident, including a call for a hearing on the incident.
United Continental Holdings' stock felt the impact of the incident on Tuesday – it dropped 1.13 percent, wiping approximately $250 million off its market capitalization. The stock had dropped as much as 6 percent prior to the market's open.
The passenger removed from the flight to Louisville, Kentucky, was identified as Dr David Dao, 69. Dao was overheard by another passenger saying that he was picked on because he is Chinese. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Dao went to medical school in Vietnam before moving to the US. He lives in Elizabethtown, about 40 miles south of Louisville, where his wife, Dr Teresa Dao, has a medical practice.
Matt Rizzetta, CEO at brand agency North 6 Agency, said that Chinese consumers are highly discerning customers and exhibit deeper brand loyalty to US brands, but are also harder to bring on board as customers.
"If you're United and you've built all this goodwill and spent all this time and made all these investments to get Chinese customers on your side, good job, pat on the back. But data shows that especially in the travel space, once you break that trust it's very difficult to regain," he said.
Jim Corridore, airline equity analyst at CFRA Research, said that prior to United's latest statement on Tuesday afternoon in which CEO Oscar Munoz apologized and said that "no one should ever be mistreated this way", that he was not expecting a major financial impact on the company right now, due to generally strong demand and high capacity in the market. But he said "we are not happy with the way the company is handling the situation, and we know particularly in China, where the company is trying to make inroads, it could have an impact."
Chris Allieri, founder and principal at public relations consultancy Mulberry & Astor, said,
"You can't just look at impact through dollars and cents — these companies are trying to be corporate citizens. They're trying to do good work in other areas, and when something like this happens, your profits and your bottom-line aside, you're still hurting."
He said, "Whether it's dollars lost now or dollars lost later, it will catch up. That's why I say that you need to take responsibility and solve the problem and move forward."
On Weibo, user who goes by the name Jinyinxingdongzhong said, "I can understand the 'overbooking' thing, but I feel deeply angry about the way they handled the situation. "I definitely will not buy" United's stock, he said, "because even if I invested in it and made money, I would have an uneasy conscience."
Joe Wong, the Chinese-American comedian, said on Weibo that "many Chinese feel they are discriminated against, but won't say anything due to personal dignity, which leads to the Western mainstream media and public disregarding the discrimination against Asians at all."
The United flight had been overbooked and four passengers were asked to voluntarily surrender their seats to accommodate flight attendants who needed to make it to Louisville to staff another flight, according to reports.
Dao refused to leave the plane, saying that he was a doctor and needed to see patients in the morning, and videos taken by passengers showed a security officer from the Chicago Department of Aviation wrestling Dao out of his seat while he screamed. He was dragged down an aisle with blood on his face. The Chicago Police Department later said Dao's head struck an armrest "causing injuries to his face".
Dao later returned to the aircraft, bloodied, saying repeatedly, "I have to go home," according to a passenger who captured the event on video.
United's Munoz also said in his statement on Tuesday that United would conduct a thorough review of the company's policies — including how it incentivizes volunteers and how it handles overbooked flights — and communicate results of the review by the end of the month.
That came after an internal email to United employees that leaked on Monday, which blamed Dao for being "disruptive and belligerent".
Munoz had said the initially that the incident was the result of having to re-accommodate a passenger, and both initial responses were viewed as tone-deaf.
"United had an opportunity on Monday to really nip it in the bud and to move forward, and to say, 'We did not do the right thing. We messed up. We are going to change this. I, Oscar Munoz as CEO, will launch an investigation,'" said Allieri.
"Nothing about [Monday's] outrage had to do with people's flights getting rebooked. Nothing. To put out in a statement that it's about re-accommodating passengers is unfathomable, how much that misses the mark," he said.
Congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat in the District of Columbia and a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, called for a hearing on the incident.
"I am asking our committee for a hearing, which will allow us to question airport police, United Airlines personnel, and airport officials, among others, about whether appropriate procedures were in place in Chicago and are in place across the United States when passengers are asked to leave a flight," she said in a statement.
US Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, tweeted that the airline "must do more than 'apologize'. Full investigation needed. Airlines must start treating passengers with respect, not like cargo."

Since 2013 when President Xi Jinping first proposed the initiative, trade volume between China and economies along the trading routes amounted to $3 trillion, total investment reached $50 billion, and newly signed contracts exceeded $304.9 billion, Shen said.
China has signed approximately 50 government-level cooperation agreements with these economies and established 56 economic and trade cooperation zones, Shen added.
Shen made the remarks at a news conference on Monday when the Beijing-based China Bond Rating Co Ltd and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences released a blue book of outbound investment and risks, with this year's emphasis on summarizing overseas investment along the Belt and Road countries and regions.
According to the annual report, China's outbound investment in those regions is expected to maintain rapid growth this year, with capital primarily flowing into sectors that meet the destinations' socioeconomic development demand.
Findings show that since 2015, energy, transportation and information technology are the top three fields attracting Chinese investors, the majority of whom come from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces.
The report shows the top three destinations receiving most investment are Southeast Asia, the Middle East and South Asia. Of the two commonly used modes, average investment scales of projects by mergers and acquisitions turn out bigger than those through greenfield investment.
Greenfield investment refers to a form of foreign direct investment where a parent company builds its operations in a foreign country from the ground up.
However, when seeking cross-border investment opportunities, Chinese companies are exposed to greater unexpected legal and cultural obstacles, the report said.
Risks in host countries, such as changing local policies and fluctuations in exchange rates, play decisive roles in investors' sustainable development and profitability, Feng Guanghua, chairman of the China Bond Rating Co Ltd, said at the news conference.
Despite the odds, homegrown companies will fulfill the goal of investing abroad by thorough preliminary investigation and prudent risk management, Shen said.
"Chinese companies need to join forces in overseas expansion, and beef up their respective advantages. They should keep away from vicious competition," he added, referring specially to a previous irrational investment frenzy.
CAGLIARI, Italy - Cagliari's new teenage signing Han Kwang-song on Sunday became the first player from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to score in Serie A.
The 18-year-old from Pyongyang, who made his debut for the Sardinian club a week ago, scored in the 95th minute in a 3-2 home defeat to Torino.
"I am very happy to score my first goal in Serie A," said Han, who said his soccer hero is Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.
"I thank the team, the coach and teammates. I feel at home in Cagliari."
Torino looked to be heading for a comfortable win after Adem Ljajic, Andrea Belotti and Afriyie Acquah gave the visitor a 3-1 lead by the 53rd minute.
But Han had other ideas.
Having impressed in a 3-1 win at Palermo last week, he replaced Marco Sau in the 81st minute and added to Marco Borriello's 19th-minute penalty for the host when he beat England goalkeeper Joe Hart deep into stoppage time.
"I tried to follow the coach's instructions, I get on well with my teammates," said Han.
"My objectives? I have so much to learn, now I would go as far forward as possible."
The two-footed striker is the first Asian to play for Cagliari.
"His dribbling, eye for goal and vision of the game are his principal characteristics," the club said in a statement.
Winner of the Under-16 Asian Championship with DPR Korea, Han shot to international recognition after he represented his country in the Under-17 World Cup, and then impressed on trial with the Italian club.
Han is not the first player from his country to make Italian soccer history: Pak Doo-lk scored the winner for DPR Korea at the 1966 World Cup to eliminate Italy in one of its greatest humiliations.

BEIJING - China is aiming to increase the scale of its cloud computing industry by more than 2.5 times by 2019, according to a new government plan.
The scale of the cloud computing industry will be expanded to 430 billion yuan ($62.29 billion) by 2019, up from 150 billion yuan in 2015, according to an action plan for 2017-2019 issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
Other targets include making breakthroughs in core technologies, increasing cloud computing in manufacturing and government affairs, and strengthening the global influence of Chinese cloud computing companies.
The ministry expects that two to three Chinese cloud computing companies will lead the global market within three years.
Cloud computing should be a strong support for China's manufacturing and internet industries and help make other social and economic sectors informationized, the ministry said.
The ministry pledged to enhance cloud computing network security and improve security regulation and relevant laws, as many users from key industries are still hesitating due to safety concerns, reliability and movability.
In the next three years, the government will help boost cloud computing technologies and encourage local governments to work with leading cloud computing companies to build public service platforms.
Support will go to cloud computing-related innovation and entrepreneurship to provide services for small and medium-sized enterprises, the ministry said.
The plan promised better financial services and personnel training, as well as efforts in the branding of current enterprises and products.
Leading cloud computing enterprises should also seek overseas expansion and boost international cooperation in alignment with the Belt and Road Initiative, it said.




Russian president Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Moscow would demand a UN investigation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria as it expected new provocations with toxic agents in the war-torn Middle East country. [Photo/Xinhua]
MOSCOW - Russian president Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Moscow would demand a UN investigation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria as it expected new provocations with toxic agents in the war-torn Middle East country.
"We intend to officially address a relevant UN structure in the Hague and call on the international community to investigate thoroughly this incident, and to take a balanced decision depending on the results of the investigation," Putin said at a joint press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.
A reported April 4 toxic gas attack in Syria's rebel-held Idlib Province in northwestern Syria killed at least 70 civilians and wounded scores of others.
Numerous Western powers, including the United States, blamed the government of Bashar al-Assad of the attack.
The Syrian government denied possession of chemical weapons, while the Russian Defense Ministry accused Syrian rebels of producing toxic agents in a depot which exploded under a strike by Syrian warplanes and caused the contamination.
The United States launched last Thursday 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian air base, from which airplanes allegedly carrying chemical weapons took off.
The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that nine civilians, including four children, were killed and about 10 others were wounded in the attack.
Putin said Moscow had information from different sources that such "provocations" were being prepared in other regions of Syria including in southern outskirts of the capital Damascus, where "some substances" would be thrown in and the official Syrian authorities would be blamed for their use.
Putin said that the developments reminded him of the events of 2003, when representatives of the United States demonstrated in the UN Security Council toxic substances, allegedly found in Iraq to justify an invasion in that country.
"After this the military campaign began in Iraq, which ended in a destruction of the country, an increase of the terrorist threat and the appearance of the Islamic State (IS) in the international scene," Putin said.
Mattarella said at the press conference that Rome maintained the necessity of finding a solution for the Syrian crisis "on the basis of a dialogue at different levels between the Syrian parties, between regional players and within the international community".
He also expressed hope that Moscow and other powers would be able to use their influence to avoid repetition of gas attacks in Syria.
"Of cause it is necessary to find the guilty and persecute them. We hope that what has happened will make all the participants in the crisis, including the most influential, do everything in their power to overcome the current intolerable situation," Mattarella said speaking through an interpreter.
The press conference took place as US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.




 
Team bus of the Borussia Dortmund football club damaged in an explosion is seen on April 12, 2017 in Dortmund, Germany. [Photo/VCG]
DORTMUND, Germany — Three explosions went off near the team bus of Borussia Dortmund, one of Germany's top soccer clubs, as it set off for a Champions League quarterfinal match on Tuesday evening. One of Dortmund's players was injured.
Police said they were working on the assumption that the blasts were directed at the Dortmund team and caused by "serious explosive devices," which may have been hidden in a hedge near a car park.
The explosions happened as the team was departing its hotel for a first-leg match against Monaco. The game was called off shortly before kickoff and rescheduled for Wednesday.
A letter claiming responsibility was found near the site of the blasts, prosecutor Sandra Luecke told a late evening news conference. She said investigators are examining the authenticity of what was written in the letter, but wouldn't reveal more about its contents, citing the ongoing investigation.
The case is being investigated as attempted homicide, Luecke said.
"We had to assume, and assumed right from the start, that this was a targeted attack against the team of Borussia Dortmund," Dortmund Police Chief Gregor Lange. Investigators are not excluding any possible angles in their investigation, while the "concrete background" to the blasts remains unclear, he said.
There were three explosions near the Dortmund bus as the team left the L'Arrivee Hotel and Spa on the outskirts of the western city of Dortmund for the stadium, around 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, at 7.15 p.m. local time (1715 GMT), police said.

Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki said the team bus had just pulled out of the hotel driveway when an explosion — a "huge bang" — happened and sent glass flying. Buerki, who is from Switzerland, told Swiss daily Blick that he was sitting in the last row of the bus, next to Bartra.
Bartra was hit by shards from the broken back window, he added. Players ducked for cover, wondering whether there would be more explosions.
"We're all shocked — nobody thought about a football match in the minutes after that," Buerki said.
LHASA -- Konggar Airport in Tibet, one of the highest-altitude airports in China, was able to accommodate a Tibet Airlines wide-body Airbus 330 aircraft overnight for the first time, the airline announced Wednesday.
The 3,600-meter-high airport in Lhasa was able to accommodate the plane after the airline's technicians solved the problem of re-starting the aircraft's engine in a low air pressure environment after an overnight stay.
A new oxygen diffusion device has been designed to increase air supply during the engine ignition process, the airline said.
High-altitude airports (over 2,438 meters above sea levels) pose safety issues for pilots as low air pressure affects flight performance. All five airports in Tibet are classified as such.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd expects to complete the construction of an e-commerce and logistics hub in Thailand by 2019, taking the internet behemoth closer to Southeast Asian economies and its goal of shedding its reliance on the Chinese market.
Building of the park is on a "steady course" and marks the company's long-term investment in Thailand, Alibaba said in an emailed statement to China Daily.
Under an agreement with the Thai government in December, Alibaba vowed to help develop the country's e-commerce sector through providing training to small businesses and individuals, and exploring ways to enhance its logistics capabilities.
Alibaba said the hub is designed to provide a one-stop service connecting SMEs, manufacturers, service providers and logistic partners, complementing its existing investment in Lazada Group, a dominant regional e-commerce platform in which Alibaba holds a majority stake.
"We hope the park will empower Thailand's innovative internet startups and boost the country's technology ecosystem," the statement added.
Under the agreement, Alibaba and its subsidiary Lazada will offer e-commerce training to 30,000 Thai SMEs to aid their access to both domestic and international e-commerce platforms and nurture software developers.
The deal also calls for Alibaba to advise the country's postal service－Thailand Post－on shipping and logistics.
The Chinese online giant is marching into a region on the cusp of a digital shopping boom fueled by fast-growing mobile phone usage.
Consultancy eMarketer projects that e-commerce sales, excluding travel, will grow at a rate exceeding 15 percent in Thailand annually over the next four years, reaching $5.69 billion by 2020.
In a similar move, Alibaba in March established the first digital free trade zone dubbed Electronic World Trade Platform in Malaysia, offering small businesses lower barriers for entry and easier access to financing.
"Alibaba's investment here will be different from that in Malaysia, where it is expected to be an e-commerce platform only. In contrast, its investment in Thailand will be broader, covering production platforms ... particularly in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam," Thai Industry Minister Uttama Savanayana was quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying.

Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industry Co Ltd, the world's biggest port machinery manufacturer, said it sees automated port terminals becoming a new growth engine and expects them to further expand to reach 100 countries and regions in 2017.
The goal to grab a bigger slice of the international market will be achieved by continued innovations in engineering and the Belt and Road Initiative, a government-backed initiative, to enhance connectivity and promote trade, said Song Hailiang, chairman of ZPMC and vice-president of its parent China Communications Construction Co Ltd.
Song Hailiang, chairman of Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industry Co Ltd.
"ZPMC is a pioneer and a steady enforcer of the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
"Over 50 countries and regions along the routes have installed ZPMC equipment and I expect the number to grow as the initiative brings synergies and radiates to more economies."
ZPMC claimed 82 percent of the world's quay crane market last year, according to World Cargo News, a trade journal based in the United Kingdom.
Despite a global decrease in international demand for shipbuilding and major infrastructure projects, demand for fully automated container systems is brisk, part of the effort to trim costs and raise efficiency in the long term.
The terminals use highly automated systems and machinery, with minimal human intervention, to handle the flood of goods that trade deals push to the docks, Song said. He added that these cut labor costs by 70 percent and improve productivity by as much as 30 percent.
The number of automated ports is expected to reach 100 by 2020, according to Kalmar, a Finland-headquartered cargo handling solutions and services provider.
The company has made a mark in the sector, currently constructing the automated terminal project of Qingdao Port in Shandong province and the fourth phase of the Yangshan Deep-water Port in Shanghai.
"We are on the right track to provide the new generation automated port systems to customers around the world," he said.
ZPMC has already received orders for automated terminals from Rotterdam World Gateway in the Netherlands and the Italian port of Vado Ligure. It is eyeing expanding to Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and other countries in Asia.
"The Belt and Road Initiative starts with physical connection of high-speed roads, railways, airports and ports," he said.

DENVER - First, Russell Westbrook broke Oscar Robertson's 55-year-old NBA record for most triple-doubles in a season.
Then, he broke the Denver Nuggets' hearts.
Westbrook's 36-foot dagger at the buzzer gave Oklahoma City a 106-105 victory, eliminating the Nuggets from playoff contention and capping an historic Sunday afternoon in which he scored 50 points to go with 15 rebounds and 10 assists.
Westbrook's 42nd triple-double is one more than the "Big O" had for the Cincinnati Royals in 1961-62, a mark that many in the NBA had considered unbreakable.
The crowd gave Westbrook a standing ovation after he broke Robertson's record with his 10th assist with 4:17 remaining.
Then, those same fans stood in stunned silence after watching Westbrook score his team's final 15 points, including the game-winner after Steven Adams took the inbounds pass from Kyle Single with 2.9 seconds left and dished to Westbrook, whose long jumper zipped through the iron as the horn sounded.
"It was a good defense," lamented Nuggets guard Gary Harris. "He's had a hell of a season. I think he might have just locked up the MVP with that one right there."
Westbrook insisted his buzzer-beater wasn't a low-percentage prayer.
"I practice that shot everyday pregame, so I definitely feel confident in shooting it."
Same spot. And, he said, usually the same result.
Do-it-yourself
Westbrook had a double-double by halftime but didn't get his triple-double until feeding Semaj Christon in the right corner for a 3-pointer that pulled the Thunder to 101-91 with more than four minutes left.
With his 10th assist and his record in the books - after four tries at that final assist - Westbrook took care of the rest of the scoring himself.
He followed a pair of layups with six free throws - half of them coming after Nikola Jokic was whistled for a flagrant foul and a technical - then added another layup.
"It was like a video game," Christon said. "I loved watching it."
Westbrook's biggest bucket was his last.
"Pure adrenaline, emotions running high, game-winning shot, it is something you dream about as a little kid to be able to do that on the road especially from that distance," Westbrook said.
"It is something you definitely will never forget."
Westbrook scored the game's final eight points overall as Denver's shooters went cold when one more bucket would have iced it.
"I give Russell credit; he is a hell of a player and an MVP candidate," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
"But I really feel that we lost this game. Our turnovers in the fourth quarter, we had six turnovers for 10 points. Down the stretch, we had a lack of poise, lack of execution."
Danilo Gallinari scored 22 of his 34 points in the third quarter to lead the Nuggets.

Foxconn Technology Group is reportedly planning to bid up to $27 billion to acquire Toshiba's chip business, according to Bloomberg.
It's yet another major acquisition swoop on a Japanese high-tech firm by Foxconn which earlier bid for taking over the electronics firm Sharp.
Analysts estimate that a reasonable valuation of Toshiba's chip business is between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, and those familiar with the matter say that the second-highest bidder offered in the region of $2 trillion at the end of March, according to a Bloomberg report.
The world's largest contract electronics manufacturer is apparently willing to bid high as it currently does not own any large memory manufacturer, and Toshiba's chip business would support Foxconn as it develops memory as a 'cash-cow' for use in a variety of networking equipment, such as Apple products.
Toshiba, the second largest chip producer is keen to sell all of its chip business, as it looks for cash to survive a substantial overrun of a US nuclear power plant project.
At the end of March, the multinational corporation approved a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States by its embattled Westinghouse Electric unit with the conglomerate saying it faced a possible 712.5 billion yen ($6.5 billion) writedown on its failing nuclear energy business and a related group net loss of more than 1 trillion yen.
On Tuesday, Toshiba reported a group net loss of 552.41 billion yen due to losses related to hefty writedowns incurred by the nuclear power plant.
On sales of 576.28 billion yen, Toshiba posted a group operating loss of 3.85 trillion yen during the April-December period.
The filing Tuesday without the approval of an auditor has yet to be accepted by regulators or the Tokyo bourse and could see the Tokyo-based firm delisted.

Chinese wines are becoming big sellers in the US, to the tune of about $700 million in 2016, thanks to wines produced on nearly 60,000 acres (242.8 million square meters) of vineyards in Northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region. A delegation from Ningxia recently traveled to the US aiming to raise the number to a higher level in 2017.
The Ningxia Hui autonomous region, about 1,000 kilometers from Beijing, is a remote place with the country's third-smallest GDP. However, it has developed its emerging wine sector in recent years.
"Ningxia is one of the most suitable places for growing grapes and producing wine. Wines produced here have the best chance of winning awards at wine-tasting competitions," said local Party Secretary-General Li Jianhua.
The French multinational luxury goods company Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy invested $28 million with a Chinese company to create the Chandon state-of-the-art winery in Yongning county.
Edward Korry, former president of the Society of Wine Educators, said that he was impressed with the level of quality that was achieved by wineries in Ningxia in a short period of time.


A 27-year-old woman is expected to have a nose and a mouth again after a series of surgeries in Shanghai.

Experts said they have used an innovative method to rebuild the woman's face, cultivating nose and upper lip tissues on her chest area for later transplant.

Such technology, which uses the patient's own tissue rather than a donor, is a major breakthrough in the field, according to Shanghai No 9 People's Hospital affiliated with the School of Medicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

The woman is from a remote village in Shiyan, Hubei province. At the age of 1, she suffered a high fever and a rare reaction in which her own immune system attacked parts of her body - a condition known as sepsis. Lacking medical care, she lost her nose and lips.

This year, the woman shared her experience online using the screen name "Yeluzi", which drew wide attention from netizens.

Li Qingfeng, an orthopedic expert at the hospital, said sepsis can result in many tissue defects.

After several rounds of discussion, a team at the hospital came up with a medical strategy to reconstruct the woman's face. The team combines experts in oral surgery, oral-cranio-maxillofacial surgery and other disciplines.

It uses 3-D printing technology to reconstruct the incomplete facial features, helping doctors evaluate the patient and design a comprehensive treatment plan.

Under the plan, the woman will undergo four surgeries to get a new nose and mouth, according to Li, the team leader for the rehabilitation and reconstruction work.

On Monday, the woman underwent a surgery lasting more than 10 hours for initial facial reshaping.

All the surgeries are expected to be finished within six months, the hospital said.

The new tissue-growth method won second prize in the 2016 National Scientific Technology Progress Award. More than 40 cases have been successfully handled at the hospital, and the technique has been adopted by other hospitals across the country, the Shanghai hospital said.



Once a leisure sport only popular among senior citizens in China, gateball has enjoyed a surge in mass participation by players of all ages, as highlighted by the expanding scale of the Chinese Gateball Championship.
The 2017 edition of the annual championship, which was established in 2005 by the Chinese Gateball Association, is expected to receive 2,000 teams to compete in regional preliminaries held in 30 provinces and municipalities through October. That month, 120 squads will advance to the national finals that will be held in Shandong province between Oct 23 and 29, the CGA said on Tuesday.
"The popularity of gateball has expanded out of its traditional circle to intrigue more young amateurs and we are excited to see more teams established to join us in this year’s championship," Weng Jiaren, president of CGA, said at the launching ceremony for the 2017 championship on Tuesday.
"As the country promotes a mass fitness campaign for better public health and more sports participation, I believe this event will contribute greatly to the national program," he said.
Last year about 1,600 teams, consisting of 20,000 players from across the country, participated in the championship.
Gateball is a mallet team sport played between two five-a-side squads on a rectangular field. Each of the 10 players is assigned a wooden ball and alternately strike the ball with a stick to try to hit the goal pole through as many as three gates on the court to score. The team finishing with the most points at the end of the 30-minute match wins.
Introduced from its birthplace, Japan, gateball began to grow in China as a popular leisure sport among seniors in the 1980s due to its non-contact motion and low access in facilities.
China won consecutive titles at the quadrennial World Gateball Championship in 2010 in Shanghai and in 2014 in Niigata, Japan and is expected to achieve a three-peat at the 2018 event, which is still in the bidding process, Weng said.
Beijing-based Defenglida Group, a conglomerate featuring diversified sectors, including tourism, wellness, film and culture, signed a five-year partnership with CGA to co-host and promote the championship from 2016-2020.
The company will host the 2017 national finals at its Kunyu Mountain International Tourism and Wellness Base in the coastal city Weihai in Shandong.
"The nature of gateball, coupled with the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, stay in line with our corporate culture and the services we provide to customers to enhance their wellbeing," said Li Jifeng, chairman and chief executive of Defenglida.
BEIJING — China is planning to define the country's agricultural production areas in two functions in three years, to assure the effective supply of agricultural products, Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu said Tuesday.
A total of 900 million mu (60 million hectares) of arable land will be allocated to main grain products including rice, wheat and corn, and 238 million mu (15.9 million hectares) will be assigned to five key agricultural products including soybean, cotton, rape seed, sugarcane and natural rubber, according to a State Council statement.
The move is in line with a national strategy on food supply, with future supply-demand relations taken into consideration, said Han.
It is aimed at optimizing agricultural production pattern and better orienting supportive policies, according to Han.
He urged more investment in agriculture infrastructure construction in these areas, such as water conservation and water-saving projects.
More innovative financial support, including loans and insurance for farmers, will be encouraged, Han said.
Han also pledged more supervision and inspection in these areas to prevent occupying the farmland for other purposes.
The governments of three of China's most populous cities have been told they provided inadequate pollution controls and failed to meet some "green" targets, according to the results of top-level inspections.
Teams under the guidance of the State Council examined Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing as part of the nation's second round of provincial inspections started in late November. The Ministry of Environmental Protection published the findings on Wednesday.
Although the problems exposed in each city varied, a common point in each report was that the municipal governments had not properly implemented some measures aimed at pollution control.
Among the severest violations was in Shanghai, where inspectors discovered local authorities had failed to meet a target to halt all illegal construction and close illegal factories by the end of last year.
In Fengcheng township alone, 976 unlicensed wood processing plants were still in production, as were 31 of the 46 illegal construction sites targeted at the start of 2016, according to the inspection report.
"Shanghai has seen some environment work growing slack and some standards have fallen," the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The city, an important business hub, has a population of about 24 million.
Beijing, with population around 21 million, also was found missing some reduction targets during the inspection.
It had been scheduled to finish treating 19 severely polluted rivers last year, but only one was finished by December, the statement said.
Its Shunyi district failed to reach the PM2.5 reduction goals for the second straight year.
The PM2.5 refers to the fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 microns that is hazardous to human health.
Inspectors also noted weak pollution control management in the three cities.
In Shanghai, inadequate law enforcement was found, with fines too light to deter polluters and about 800 companies that were ordered to shut down due to their pollution output were still in operation.
In Beijing, about 10,000 small companies cited as polluters were still in operation in Daxing district, ranking the city as having the worst air pollution in 2016.
And Chongqing, with a population of 30 million, has 100,000 farms, of which the majority were not listed in the improvement plan to reduce pollution. About 28 million metric tons of waste from the farms were discharged untreated annually, the statement said.
In addition, inspection teams have found water pollution worsening in some areas in the three cities.
In total, the three governments have dealt with all 6,063 cases involving violations cited by inspectors.
Some 3,542 polluting companies were required to correct their pollution problems and 61 people responsible for the problems were detained in the three cities.
The high-level environmental inspections conducted last year have helped control some pollution, Environment Minister Chen Jining said in March, adding the 15 remaining provincial regions will have inspections this year. Last year, China conducted a pilot and two rounds of inspections covering the 16 provincial regions.
All public hospitals have been told to end the longtime practice of drug price markups by the end of September as part of the ongoing healthcare reform, the top economic planner said on Wednesday.
Public hospitals' loss of revenue will be offset for the most part by an increase in the prices of patient services, and more government investment is expected, a National Development and Reform Commission statement said.
The markups, a key source of income for public hospitals, are a major but thorny issue in healthcare reform, which aims for universal coverage of basic healthcare services, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.
Since the 1950s, public hospitals have been selling drugs at a markup. The maximum is 15 percent. Although the policy helped make up for a lack of adequate government healthcare funding, "gradually it evolved into a way to reap profits, contributing to worsening problems like overprescribing, an excessive use of antibiotics by hospitals, and rising medical expenses", said Wang Hesheng, vice-minister of the health and family planning agency.
With the expected drop in revenues from drug sales, authorities will adjust the fees for medical services, the NDRC said on Wednesday.
Charges related to the expertise of medical staff, like those for diagnosis, surgery and rehabilitation, will rise, while those for tests requiring major medical equipment will drop, the commission said.
The commission also is requiring local price regulators to carry out other necessary reforms following the measure, including changing medical insurance payments so rising service fees are covered by insurance reimbursement. Also, attention must be given to meeting the basic healthcare needs of low-income people.
Many public hospitals in China had already abolished drug price markups before Wednesday's announcement.
In Beijing, more than 3,600 medical institutions, including all public ones, had abolished the practice starting Saturday.
The measure is expected to lower the cost of outpatient treatment by about 5 percent, but the cost for inpatient treatment, including surgery, will rise by about 2.5 percent, said Li Sufang, deputy director of the Beijing Commission of Development and Reform.
Drug sales accounted for a third of the income of public hospitals last year, according to the Beijing Commission for Health and Family Planning.

QINGDAO, China - World champion Sun Yang won the men's 400m freestyle with the world's best time of the year at the Chinese National Swimming Championships on Monday.
Sun, 25, met no challenge in the event as he touched home first in the opening final of the championships in three minutes and 42.16 seconds, the fastest time of the year in the world.
"The timing is satisfying," said Sun, who competed in his first event nearly eight months after the Rio Olympic Games, where the two-time world champion finished second after Australian Mack Horton in the 400m freestyle.
"I keep my eyes open for the ongoing Australian National Championships and I will try my best to outpace these swimmers," said Sun. His timing on Monday beat Horton's winning mark in Australia by 2.02 seconds. "All of us are preparing for the World Championships."
After Sun's triumph, Yan Zibei became the first swimmer to break a national record at the Championships as the 21-year-old finished first in 58.92 seconds in the semifinals of the men's 100m breaststroke.
"I went all out this evening," said Yan, representing Team Hubei. "I did think about breaking the national record but I never thought I could swim in 59 seconds this time."
In other actions, Li Bingjie from Team Hebei won the women's 400m freestyle in four minutes and 10.52 seconds.
Olympic medalist Fu Yuanhui led Team Zhejiang to clinch the women's 4x100m freestyle relay title in three minutes and 39.15 seconds. But their male teammates failed to win their relay due to the absence of Sun Yang, and Team Guangdong placed the first in three minutes and 18.14 seconds.

Chinese technology conglomerate LeEco has abandoned its $2 billion scheduled acquisition of US television maker Vizio Inc, and is instead exploring other ways to incorporate LeEco's content into Vizio's devices.
In a joint statement, released on Monday, the two companies announced the merger would not proceed but LeEco and Vizio still believed there was great synergy between the two companies.
The two companies said they were looking for ways to integrate LeEco's Le app and content into Vizio's CE platform and bring Vizio's products to the China market by engaging in a collaborative partnership.
In July, LeEco announced its acquisition of the California-based Vizio, which has 30 million users, for $2 billion. The deal was intended to create a foundation for branding and acquiring US customers.
The collapse of the deal is a sign that LeEco's global expansion plans are faltering. Jia Yueting, CEO of LeEco, said late last year that the company was struggling to raise cash after the rapid expansion of his media and internet empire.
Founded in Beijing by Jia in 2004 as a Netflix-style streaming video platform, LeEco's vision is to offer a suite of connected hardware and services.
LeEco subsequently moved into content production, smart technology and electric cars and expanded its market into the United States and India. LeEco bought Coolpad to boost subscription and smart phone sales in 2016. It also partnered with American telecom giant AT&T in a deal that included carrying the US company's DirecTV Now streaming service last year.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, US, April 11, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]
Trump, who has faced criticism for lacking a broader strategy to deal with the Syria crisis, insisted he has no plans to "go into" the war-torn country.
Senior White House officials, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said Assad's government carried out the April 4 sarin nerve gas attack on civilians in Syria's Idlib province, killing 87 people including many children, to put pressure on rebels making advances in the area.
Russia has defended the Syrian leader against US allegations that his forces carried out the attack, saying there is no evidence. Russia has blamed Syrian rebels.
"It's clear that the Russians are trying to cover up what happened there," one White House official said.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that the facts backed up the US version of events. "Russia is on an island when it comes to its support of Syria or its lack of, frankly, acknowledgment of what happened," he told reporters.
But at the same briefing Spicer drew criticism after he sought to underscore the ghastliness of the gas attack by saying, "You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons." Nazi Germany used gas chambers to kill millions of Jews during the Holocaust.
Spicer later apologized and said he should not have made the comparison. "It was a mistake. I shouldn't have done it and I won't do it again," Spicer told CNN in an interview. "It was inappropriate and insensitive."
The White House officials said Russia has frequently offered multiple, conflicting accounts of Syrian government aggression including the incident in the village of Khan Sheikhoun to sow doubt within the international community.
The United States launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield on Thursday to retaliate after the attack. The strikes thrust the administration of President Donald Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Russia, into confrontation with Moscow.
Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said on Tuesday she thought Russia knew about the chemical attack inadvance. "They didn't look shocked. They didn't look surprised.
They were so quick to defend. And then the evidence comes out, and we see exactly what it is and we know exactly what the environment was. Then you realize," she said on CNN.
US intelligence indicates that the chemical agent in the attack was delivered by Syrian Su-22 aircraft that took off from the Shayrat airfield, according to a White House report given to reporters.
In a four-page document, the White House sought to rebut many of Moscow's claims about the circumstances of the attack.
It said the Syrian planes were in the vicinity of Khan Sheikhoun about 20 minutes before the attack and left shortly afterward.
"Additionally, our information indicates personnel historically associated with Syria's chemical weapons program were at Shayrat airfield in late March making preparations for an upcoming attack in northern Syria, and they were present at the airfield on the day of the attack," the report said.
Washington wants Russia to stop supporting Assad, who has been fighting a six-year-long civil war against mostly Sunni Muslim rebels, also with the backing of Shi'ite Muslim Iran.
Formula E eyes new Shanghai race as sponsors aim to boost profile




Formula E, the street-racing series for electric vehicles, looks set to expand its Chinese calendar as sponsors seek a bigger slice of the world's largest car market.
The championship staged its inaugural race in Beijing in 2014 and returned the following year. It kicked off the current campaign by debuting in Hong Kong in November.
Now the series wants to include a third Chinese stop, with Shanghai very much in the running after "really positive" talks between Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag, the city's vice-mayor and prospective local partners last month.
"China is a key market that we really want to focus on and develop," said Agag.
"Electric cars are being developed a lot and becoming a lot more mainstream in China. Our mission is to promote electric cars, so we are here to see how we can expand Formula E in this country and attract a larger Chinese fan base."
While Agag described last year's Hong Kong race as "a big success" and said Formula E will return, a second race on the mainland is a priority, with many of the participating automakers keen to maximize their exposure.
The fourth race of Formula E's third season hit Mexico City on April 1 and saw ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport team's Lucas di Grassi notch a dramatic win.
Jean-Eric Vergne of China's Team Techeetah's was runner-up, just as he was in the previous race in Buenos Aires.
A new entry this season, Techeetah was founded by Chinese sports marketing company SECA following the acquisition of the former Team Aguri last July.
As the series gains traction, it is showcasing more Chinese flavor.
Racing as Team UK this term, NextEV NIO, a startup founded by Chinese internet entrepreneur William Li, started off as Team China Racing and carried Nelson Piquet Jr to the inaugural drivers' championship.
Faraday Future, an American startup backed by Chinese internet firm LeEco, partners with Dragon Racing.
What's more, Chinese partners are the third largest shareholder of Formula E, owning a stake of above 10 percent, according to Agag.
In February, CMC Capital Partners, parent company of SECA, announced a long-term multi-million-dollar investment into Formula E.
"It gives a strong signal that China is really betting on electric cars and electrification to realize clean mobility," said Agag.
"The more we can do to help with this change in China, the better. That's why we are so committed to China.
Electric vehicles are an obvious way of alleviating air pollution, so the Chinese government provides subsidies to EV manufacturers and consumers.
"China's EV market will be the biggest in the world very shortly," Nick Sampson, vice-president of research and development at Faraday Future, told China Daily at the race in Mexico City.
"The great thing for China at the present time is that it hasn't got so many vehicles on the road yet.
"So, while the US needs to replace a massive number of road cars with electric vehicles, China just needs to persuade people who haven't had a car to go with an electric one as the best choice."
Some of the existing EV technologies in China are basic, according to Sampson, and Formula E is a great platform for manufacturers to test and improve them.
But at this point, China-based EV manufacturers are conspicuously absent from the list of Formula E's constructors.
Despite being Chinese-backed, NextEV NIO and Faraday Future don't hold licenses as EV manufacturers in China.
"It's a little disappointing to see that the licensed EV manufacturers in China haven't taken advantage of the opportunity to test their technology on the front," Ivan Yim, managing director of Techeetah, told China Daily.
"It would be good to see at least one or two of them participating in the series because motor racing is a very good platform for them to demonstrate their technology.
"They can evolve season by season through testing their technology on the race track and then transfer it to street cars."

SEOUL - South Korea's frontrunner for the country's upcoming May 9 presidential election Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday he will immediately push to have a supplementary budget drafted if he is elected.
In a speech on his economic pledges, Moon said he will aim for investment in 10 key sectors and expects to create over 500,000 new jobs per year on average.




Moon did not specify an amount for the pledged supplementary budget.

WASHINGTON - The US Department of Transportation (DOT) said Monday evening that it would probe the incident in which the United Airlines had one of its passengers forcefully removed.
"The DOT remains committed to protecting the rights of consumers and is reviewing the involuntary denied boarding of passenger(s) from United Express flight 3411 to determine whether the airline complied with the oversales rule," it said in a statement.
The response came after a horrific incident took place at Chicago O'hare International Airport on Sunday, when a passenger of Asian descent with bloodied face was literally dragged off a plane by airport police.
United Airlines said that due to oversale of tickets, four passengers need to leave the plane, and when an monetary incentive of 800 US dollars lured no volunteers, flight attendants said they used computers to "randomly" choose four unlucky passengers.
Three passengers complied with the airlines' demand but the fourth, a 59-year-old doctor who said he needed to reach a patient, refused to disembark.
Airport police were then summoned and wrestled the man out of his seat. The man's mouth was hit in the process and bled heavily.
"While it is legal for airlines to involuntarily bump passengers from an oversold flight when there are not enough volunteers, it is the airline's responsibility to determine its own fair boarding priorities," the DOT said in the statement.
DAMASCUS - Intense battles raged on Tuesday between the Syrian army and the rebels in the southern province of Daraa, amid information that the rebels received large reinforcement through the Jordanian borders.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Syrian air force carried out 40 airstrikes on Tuesday against the rebels, who are attempting to storm and control the Manshiyeh area, whose capture by the rebels threatens the downfall of the city to the rebels.
The London-based watchdog group said 16 Syrian soldiers and officers were killed a day earlier during the battles in Daraa, adding that among the rebels group is the Front for Liberating the Levant, previously known as the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front.
Meanwhile, a military source told Xinhua that the battles flared in Daraa after the rebels received a huge logistical support through the Jordanian borders, including heavy weapons and vehicles.
Hundreds of rebel fighters, as well as tanks and vehicles reached the rebels in Daraa, the source said on condition of anonymity.
The rebels have recently upped their offensives in Daraa to capture Manshiyeh neighborhood, which includes three hilltops overlooking most of the neighborhoods in Daraa.
It's feared that if the Manshiyeh fell to the rebels, the entire city of Daraa will fall as well.
Abdul-Aziz Farez, a political expert, said that Jordan supports the rebels in Daraa for two main points: the first is water, as Daraa contain two water sources.
The second, he added, is the geographic size and location near the Jordanian borders, which will enable Jordan, with the help of the rebels, to make Daraa as a buffer zone.

China's badminton head coach Li Yongbo has stepped down from the head coach post of China's national team and will be reassigned to an advisory panel with the Chinese Olympic Committee, qq.com reported on Tuesday.
Li, who is now overseeing a tournament in Singapore, confirmed in a response to the website on Tuesday that he won't seek another term as the head coach of China's national badminton squad as the team will reshuffle its coaching crew next month before the 2017 Sudirman Cup in Australia.
Regrouping coaching staff after every Olympic Games has been routine within China's sports system, adopted by a variety of national squads to stay fresh and motivated to prepare for another Olympic circle.
Li, however, has sat through six Olympic Games in the high-profile position since 1993 due to the team's undisputed prowess at major events under his helm.
After his retirement, Li will extend his career as a member of a newly-established advisory body affiliated with the COC. Renowned ex-national coaches from other events, such as Wang Yifeng of shooting and Sun Haiping of athletics, will join Li on the panel, which is tasked with providing proposals for youth sports promotion and massive fitness development.
"After serving so many years in the post, I have felt the fatigue more than ever ... and I've realized it's time to step back from the frontline to allow the younger generation to lead the team with a new philosophy. That's probably better for the team's future," Li said in the qq.com report.
During his 24-year tenure as head coach, Li worked to develop Team China into a world dominating power in badminton, winning 18 Olympic gold medals from 1996 to 2016, 10 Sudirman Cup world mixed team championship titles and nine Uber Cup (women's team world championship), as well as five Thomas Cup (men's team) titles.
However, Li's progressive winner-take-all mindset and outspoken personality have seen him in hot water constantly throughout his career, highlighted by the match-throwing scandal during the 2012 London Olympics.
After the pool stage of the women's doubles tournament in London, China's then-world No 1 pair, Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli, were disqualified from the Games for intentionally losing in a group game at Li's behest in an attempt to secure a preferential draw for the knockout phase.
Team China's subpar performance at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where it bagged only two gold medals, the least number since 2000, in men's singles and doubles, coupled with the men's squad's shock exit from the Thomas Cup earlier at home, triggered calls from media and fans to replace Li.
More than 300 mountaineers from around the world will try to conquer some of the planet's highest peaks during this year's spring climbing season in the Tibet autonomous region.
Adventurers from 30 countries filed climb plans with the Tibet Mountaineering Association ahead of the season, which began Monday and runs for 60 days.
"The best time to climb is the last week of May, because conducive weather factors are forecast during this period," said Sonam, the association's secretary, who predicted that 100 people would reach summits this season.
Tibet is home to the world's highest mountain, Qomolangma－known as Mount Everest in the West－which stands at 8,848 meters. The surrounding range also includes Cho Oyu (8,201 meters) and Shishapangma (8,012 meters).
In addition to the mountaineers, the seasonal climbing activities will involve more than 100 guides, translators and trainers, according to the association. Of those filing plans to climb, more than one-third, 135, were from Nepal.
"So far, 22 climbers from various parts of China have registered to take part in climbs assisted by about 100 coaches, guides and support crews from domestic mountaineering associations and companies," Sonam said.
He said conditions at Qomolangma Base Camp have improved since it was connected to the regional power grid in 2014.
Previously, the camp was powered by generators, "but the supply was not stable", he said. "The climbers couldn't rest well with the big noise from the generators, and the diesel of the generators brought hidden dangers for the environment."
The spring season is also good news for Tibetan herdsmen, Sonam added, as their incomes will be boosted by working as porters or by renting out yaks to carry supplies up mountain passes.
The Nepali participants all entered from Tibet's Gyirong Port, and the climbers of other countries made their entry from Lhasa, the regional capital.
The climbers will set up tents at base camps and then will receive adaptive training before relocating to higher sites assisted by guides.
Last year, 696 climbers from 34 countries and regions, including 424 in the spring, visited Tibet to climb, according to Tibet Commercial News.
Surrounded by snowcapped mountains and glaciers, Tibet has many natural advantages for its mountaineering industry. It has five mountains higher than 8,000 meters, more than 70 mountains higher than 7,000 meters and at least 1,000 mountains higher than 6,000 meters.

The China-Myanmar crude oil pipeline started operations after an oil tanker began offloading crude oil in the Southeast Asian country on Monday, which signals a new phase in energy cooperation between the two countries and helps ensure China's oil and gas imports.
The 140,000-metric-ton oil tanker Suezmax began offloading crude oil at Made Island oil port, the starting point of the pipeline, in Myanmar.
The 771-kilometer pipeline ends in southwestern China's Yunnan province.
The pipeline has a designed annual transmission capacity of 22 million tons. Once the pipeline becomes fully operational, Myanmar can also be provided with 2 million tons of crude oil through it annually.
China National Petroleum Corp, the country's largest oil and gas producer, holds a 50.9 percent stake in the pipeline, while Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise owns the remainder.
"The pipeline well ensures China's oil and gas import diversification, following the second China-Russia crude oil pipeline, which started operation last year in northeastern China's Heilongjiang province, and the China-Kazakhstan oil pipeline," said Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a consulting company that provides analysis of China's energy market.
With the new pipeline, China's oil and gas imports will no longer have to pass through the Malacca Straits, a narrow channel that connects the Indian Ocean with the Pacific Ocean, Li said.
"The safety level of pipeline transmission is much higher than for sea shipments, which will ensure a stable energy supply to China," she said. "The economic benefits will grow as deliveries increase."
The oil gateway will help ease the oil supply shortage in southwestern China, CNPC's South-East Asia pipeline company said.
China and Myanmar signed an agreement on Monday, which allows CNPC to import oil via the Bay of Bengal in Myanmar and pump it through the pipeline to a new refinery in Yunnan.

A series of watercolor wood print paintings depicting the picturesque landscape of West Lake is being showcased in Japan from April 6 to 12, as a commemoration of the 35 years of friendly relationship between East China's Zhejiang province and Japan's Shizuoka prefecture.
Zhejiang is best known for its copious waters; and West Lake, resting quietly in the center of the provincial capital Hangzhou, has long been recognized as the origin of the local culture.
In celebration of the prolonged cultural exchanges between the two sides, the exhibition displays 32 outstanding art works, including ones from the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911) and others perfectly integrating modern ideas and traditional techniques.
The exhibition also uses various multi-media presentation tools to vividly and thoroughly reveal the past, present and future of the historic lake.
"It's amazing to see the ancient Chinese technique 'reviving' in Japan," a local visitor exclaimed after learning that the over 1,400-year-old artistic style had once been introduced into his motherland."And these art works have a 'magic power', bringing me to a splendid beauty from afar!"

BEIJING -- Chinese authorities on Wednesday publicized eight cases showing their success in cracking down on online pornography.
The National Office Against Pornographic and Illegal Publications in 2017 launched a new round of a nationwide campaign against the production, sale and distribution of illegal publications and online pornography that could affect juveniles.
The campaign has specially targeted online streaming and the use of instant messaging and cloud storage services to spread pornography, and many criminal suspects were caught and punished.
In one case, Beijing police in January found a company used its app platform to perform obscene live shows, gaining a large sum of illegal earnings. The platform was shut down and the company had its license suspended by the police.
In another case in east China's Zhejiang Province, the local police found some people using cloud storage services to distribute erotic videos. Two suspects were later apprehended, along with more than 10,000 illegal videos. They were found to have grossed illegal gains of more than 100,000 yuan ($14,500).
HANGZHOU — As bike-sharing takes China by storm, one company has entered the industry with a new product -- the foldable electric bike.
Zhejiang Linju Smart Technology Co, the electric bike's maker, said it has released 400 e-bikes since March in the city of Jinhua, Zhejiang province, where the company is based.
An e-bike can go up to 20 kilometers per hour and, when parked, can be folded to cover as little space as a piece of A4 paper, according to the company.
The e-bikes need to be parked at designated bays where they can be charged, and batteries can be fully charged in just 20 minutes, the company said.
To use the bikes, one has to press a button at the station and then scan a QR code with a mobile phone. It costs 2 yuan (about 30 cents) for an hour, and 20 yuan for a day. No deposit is needed.
Since last year, a flood of bikes has returned to the streets of China -- formerly known as the Bicycle Kingdom -- thanks to the development of Internet technology enabling riders to unlock and drop off public bikes with their mobile phones.
Bike-sharing has been welcomed in many Chinese cities beset by urban ills such as pollution and traffic gridlock. But people who are used to riding electric bikes, particularly in the south of the country, have hoped to see e-bikes shared too.
"I have been using the e-bike sharing service since the first day it was launched. It takes more than 20 minutes to reach the office, about six kilometers away," said Li Jian, a local resident. "It gives me a comfortable ride, even on bumpy roads."
"We will put 40,000 e-bikes on the streets of Jinhua by September 2018," said Chen Qiutian, general manager of the company, citing an agreement it signed with the government.
"There will be e-bikes in the city center and most residential communities, with a station every 150 meters," Chen said.
Each e-bike is equipped with a GPS transmitter to guard against theft.
The company has set a long-term goal to release e-bikes in the provincial capital of Hangzhou this year, before it expands nationwide. The target is 150 million e-bikes in 20 cities by 2021.
US president backs plan with Canada, Mexico

NEW YORK - With dozens of secure, tournament-ready venues to choose from, the United States, Canada and Mexico on Monday announced a joint bid to stage the 2026 World Cup, aiming to become the first three-way co-hosts of FIFA's showpiece tournament.
US Soccer Federation chief Sunil Gulati, who announced the bid in New York with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts, said they had the backing of President Donald Trump, despite the American leader's rocky relations with Mexico.
Gulati said 60 matches would be staged in the United States, with Canada and Mexico hosting 10 games each. The US would host all knockout games from the quarterfinals onwards, he added.
He played down suggestions that politics could hamper the bid, claiming Trump was "especially pleased" with Mexico's involvement.
"The president of the US is fully supportive ... we are not at all concerned at some of the concerns that some people may raise," Gulati said.
Trump was elected last year after a campaign marked by rhetoric against Mexico, vowing to build a wall to keep out illegal immigrants he branded "criminals" and "rapists".
The joint bid will start as the heavy early favorite in the race, despite US prosecutors leading the probe into soccer corruption that rocked the sport in 2015 and led to the downfall of former FIFA supremo Sepp Blatter.
Open secret
A North American bid for 2026 had long been regarded as inevitable.
That sense of certainty hardened last year, when FIFA's council ruled that neither Europe nor Asia would be eligible to run for the 2026 tournament because the regions are hosting the next two World Cups: Russia in 2018, followed by Qatar in 2022.
With Europe and Asia ineligible, CONCACAF - the body which represents North, Central American and Caribbean soccer - could face competition from the Africa, South America and the Oceania confederations.
US soccer officials were coy about the possibility of a future World Cup bid since the country lost out to Qatar for 2022 at a corruption-tarnished vote in Zurich in 2010.
However, the prospect of a fresh North American bid gathered momentum in 2014 after the World Cup in Brazil.
That campaign captured the imagination of enough US sports fans to result in huge crowds attending public screenings of games at cities across the country.
The club game is also booming in the US, with record numbers attending Major League Soccer in 2016.
The US also burnished its credentials as a major-tournament host with last year's 16-team Copa America Centenario.
The US first hosted the World Cup in 1994, staging a commercially successful 24-team tournament that played out to packed stadia.
That tournament remains the most attended World Cup in history, with just over 3.5 million fans flocking to its 52 games, an average of 68,991 per match.
Mexico has hosted the World Cup twice before - 1970 and 1986.
Canada, which has only one World Cup finals appearance, in 1986, has never hosted the tournament. But the hockey-mad country earned plaudits for its staging of the Women's World Cup in 2015.
Under FIFA plans for its expanded 48-team World Cup, CONCACAF will be awarded six berths.
Gulati indicated that officials expected all three host nations to be granted places.
"There has never been a World Cup where the host countries have not been qualified," Gulati said.
A North American tournament is also likely to be attractive to FIFA for public-relations reasons.
With state-of-the-art venues in every US state and Canadian province and dozens more in Mexico to choose from, there is little risk of stadiums being left to rot as white elephants when the event ends - a problem that affected the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 edition in Brazil.
"We have the luxury of having stadiums that already exist in all three nations," Gulati said.

A Spanish club has acquired a stake in a Chinese university football club, the first-ever deal that introduces foreign capital to Chinese soccer after China released last year an overall soccer reform plan, calling for more introduction of foreign experts and expertise to help develop youth football.
The Beijing Institute of Technology Football Club (BIT FC) of China's League Two sold 29 percent of its stake to the Football Club Reus Deportivo (CF Reus) of the Second Division of Spanish League, in a move aimed at bringing the methodology that is currently practiced in Reus and was previously implemented in FC Barcelona, as it was announced in Beijing at a press conference.
An agreement of collaboration and share transfer was reached by the BIT FC, a club under the Beijing-based university including one professional team and one university team, and the Direct Sport Management (DSM) company, a Chinese affiliate to Hong Kong-based company CSSB that owns CF Reus. CSSB is a company focused on developing soccer to an international level, with majority of its shareholders from Spain.
The deal will bring CSSB's financial support that will allow the university club to improve its infrastructure and Reus' management team led by Joan Laporta and Joan Oliver, who ran FC Barcelona from 2003 to 2010 and witnessed Barcelona's glorious rise to become world number one club, said Yang Bin, standing president of the Beijing Institute of Technology.
It will also bring know-how from Spanish soccer, including the expertise of the coaching team, the development plan for youth academy, the renovation advice on the pitch, and even chefs for nutrition and doctors for treatment, said Joan Oliver, who comes to Beijing as a leading representative of CF Reus and the investor group.
Joan believed the cooperation opened a new era for soccer development in China as the Chinese and Spanish side will work together to develop a new model that's not base on big players acquisition, but on the training and development of the Chinese youth talent.
"We need to work for a dream that will make BIT become a great football club, and the Chinese football will finally get the place in the world that it deserves," Joan said.
Joan believed that BIT FC may become a first-class professional club in China one day with a strong reserve force from its university team, after ten or even more years of cooperation with Reus and CSSB.
The deal is the second move this year from the Spanish side to tap into the potential Chinese market, following FC Barcelona's "tens of millions of dollars" investment into a training and experience center on China's southernmost island province of Hainan, announced two months ago.

"I'm sorry. We will fix this," Munoz said in a statement a day after he had defended the company in a memo that contained no apologies to the passenger. On Tuesday, as the storm of criticism continued, Munoz changed course.
"I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard," he said in the statement. "No one should ever be mistreated this way."
Video showing a man who appeared to be Asian being snatched from his seat Sunday evening and dragged from United Airlines Flight 3411 sparked global outrage that escalated as consumers in China, a key United market, called for boycotts of the airline. Regulators in the United States said they are reviewing the incident.
United has not identified the passenger, and Reuters was not able to confirm his identity.
United Continental Holdings Inc shares fell as much as 4.4 percent on Tuesday, but recovered some losses and ended 1.1 percent lower. More than 16 million United shares changed hands, the most for any session in a year.
The stock is down about 3 percent for the year.
United is also suffering from broader worries among investors about U.S. airline performance.
In his apology, Munoz pledged a "a thorough review of crew movement, our policies for incentivizing volunteers in these situations, how we handle oversold situations and an examination of how we partner with airport authorities and local law enforcement." The findings will be released by April 30, he said.
Munoz, a former railroad executive who took over United in 2015, already faced pressure from activist investors to improve the airline's performance, including its customer relations. In April 2016, United agreed with a group of investors to install airline industry veteran Robert Milton as non-executive chairman.
The risks to United from the uproar over the forced removal of the passenger in Chicago intensified on Tuesday. On Chinese social media, the incident attracted the attention of more than 480 million users on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform.
United has about 20 percent of total U.S.-China airline traffic and has a partnership with Air China, the third-largest Chinese airline, according to analysts. It flies to more Chinese cities than other U.S. airlines. Last year, United added nonstop flights from San Francisco to Hangzhou, its fifth destination in mainland China.
According to Tyler Bridges, a passenger who was on board the flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, the man who was dragged off before takeoff said repeatedly that he was being discriminated against because he was Chinese.
"He said, 'I'm a doctor; I need to see patients," said Bridges, a civil engineer from Louisville who recorded much of the incident on his phone.
In the United States, social media outrage continued, with the incident trending on Twitter for the second consecutive day. Many users promoted hashtags #NewUnitedAirlinesMotto and #BoycottUnitedAirlines.
This is the second time in less than a month that United has been caught in a social media storm. In late March, a United gate agent's decision to refuse to board two teenage girls wearing leggings provoked a viral backlash.

The campus in Karamay, which is of geographic importance in the Silk Road Economic Belt, will train high-caliber engineering talents and promote the technological and cultural communication in Central Asia, according to a guideline on the development of the new campus.
"Cultural identity is important for any cooperation. To make things happen, people working together should first identify with each other," Zhang Laibin, president of the university, told China Daily's website on March 31.

The university's Beijing campus started a 15-day seminar on energy strategies of the Belt and Road countries on March 29.
The seminar, organized by the Academy for International Business Officials of the Ministry of Commerce, is being attended by 47 officials from the Belt and Road countries.
Statistics show that more than 20 large and mid-sized oil companies, including the China National Petroleum Corporation, the China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, had oil and gas investments in countries along the Belt and Road as of the end of 2014. This presents opportunities for international cooperation in education as well.
Of the overseas students studying at the university, 80 percent are from 17 countries covered by the Belt and Road Initiative. The number of students or graduates from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, for instance, has exceeded 1,000.
The students work at the forefront of the oilfield after graduation. They not only make a huge contribution to the local oil and gas industry, but help disseminate the Chinese culture and feel a sense of identity with the Chinese, said the president.
The university also provides training for Chinese companies' overseas employees, foreign companies' executives and technicians, as well as foreign government officials in the energy sector. It has held about 180 training sessions for nearly 3,000 people in more than a dozen countries along the Belt and Road, covering topics on petroleum technology, management, culture and languages.
It helped train staff from PetroKasakhstan after the Canada-registered company was acquired by CNPC in 2006. Since 2010, it has provided Chinese language training for Turkmenistan employees from CNPC's Amu Darya natural gas project.
Meanwhile, the university has dispatched more than 600 Chinese students including about 400 undergraduates and more than 200 postgraduates to the Belt and Road regions.
At a forum for university presidents in Egypt in March 2016, Zhang vowed to cooperate with higher education institutions in countries along the Belt and Road and promote sharing of premier education resources among universities.
In addition to China University of Petroleum, Beijing Foreign Studies University, a top language university, said recently it will add 11 language courses, mostly African and Oceanic tongues, to boost talent support for the country's extending ties with the regions.
People wait in line to apply for public rental homes in Beijing's Chaoyang district on Tuesday.Wang Zhuangfei / China Daily
As soaring property prices force many to consider leaving Beijing for cheaper cities, a pilot project offering subsidized housing in the capital to nonlocal residents has made some to think again.
Unsurprisingly, competition to land a subsidized apartment is fierce.
On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people braved a chilling spring wind to stand in line for at least four hours to apply for one of the 400 so-called public rental homes.
A total of 120 homes are reserved for people who do not hold Beijing hukou, or household registration, a major change from the policy of previous years.
The registration line in Maquanying - a suburb of Chaoyang district where 300 of the apartments are located (the rest are in Daxing district) - stretched more than 300 meters on Tuesday afternoon.
"The line was this long at 9 am, and it's still this long at 2 pm, even though we're handling 120 applications an hour," said a community worker who declined to give his name.
He said the huge number of applicants was beyond expectations and that 30 extra workers had been added to the 20-strong team that worked on Monday, the first day for applications. The last day is Wednesday.
To qualify for a subsidized apartment, applicants without Beijing hukou must have paid social insurance or income tax in the capital for at least five years, be 18 to 45 years old and own no property. Applicants will then be selected at random.
On Monday, almost 60 percent of the applicants were non-Beijingers, the worker said.
On Tuesday, as the line moved slowly, many complained about the trouble created by on-site application and sighed over their slim chances.
Gao Yang, 30, from Henan province, has been working in Beijing for six years as an IT engineer in Chaoyang district.
"It's a long line and the chances are slim. But if I'm not in line, there is no hope of renting an apartment at half the market price," Gao said.
The price of the public rental housing available this time is about 2,400 yuan ($348) a month for a two-bedroom apartment. A similar property on the regular rental market can cost more than 5,000 yuan a month.
Gao Chao, who works as a designer in Fengtai district, said he has to live with his wife and two other couples in a three-bedroom apartment to save money, but the rent is about the same as at the public rental housing.
"It's like trying your luck buying a lottery ticket. But as long as there is hope, I want to try it," the 30-year-old said.
The offering of the 400 public rental units is the first wave of a pilot project that aims to help people without Beijing household registration. In the pilot, 30 percent of public rental housing and price-fixed housing will be allocated to people without Beijing hukou.
So far, 10,300 tenants, or 13 percent, of these live in public rental housing in Beijing do not hold such registrations.
According to a survey by China Youth Daily published on Tuesday, 23 percent of 2,000 respondents had already left top-tier cities like Beijing, while 47 percent were considering leaving. The main reason given was soaring housing prices.

Min Bahadur Sherchan plans to climb the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) peak next month during a window of favorable weather on the summit.
"I want to be the oldest person to scale Everest again to be an inspiration for humankind, a boost for the elderly people and an encouragement for youths," Sherchan said Wednesday at his home in Kathmandu. "It will be a message for everyone that age is no obstacle to achieving their dreams."The grandfather of 17 and great-grandfather of six first scaled Everest in May 2008, when he was 76, but his record was broken by then 80-year-old Japanese climber Yuichiro Miura in 2013.
Sherchan's attempt to climb Everest in 2013 was cut short because of financial problems and delays in getting the climbing permit. Another try in 2015 was canceled because an avalanche triggered by devastating earthquake swept the base camp, killing 19 people just a day before he reached the site.
"I am confident that I will succeed this time. I have no problems that could stop me from climbing Everest and the only problem could be weather," Sherchan said. He added that he has no respiratory problems and his blood pressure is normal.
Being born in the mountains, he has one big advantage over most climbers: He is used to the altitude. High-altitude sickness can be fatal for people who are not acclimated to the thin air and low oxygen levels. He said he is worried only about the five kilograms (11 pounds) he gained in the last few months.
"I am not scared of climbing, but the only part I fear is the part between base camp and Camp 1, which is very dangerous," Sherchan said.
That stretch includes the dreaded Khumbu Icefall, where climbers use aluminum ladders and ropes to navigate around deep crevasses amid tall ice blocks.
Sherchan's love of mountaineering began in 1960 when he was assigned by the Nepalese government as a liaison officer for the Swiss team climbing Mount Dhaulagiri.
He later became an apple farmer and constructed roads and dams before settling down to run hotels in Kathmandu.
He and his team of six guides and helpers leave for the mountain Sunday. His team leader, Shiva Bahadur Sapkota, has scaled Everest twice.
He said that if he regains his record, he plans to campaign for world peace by traveling to conflict areas like Syria.
"After I become the oldest Everest climber, people will listen to my campaign for world peace," he said.

Shanghai police have taken over a case in which at least four foreigners were seen in a subway carriage eating a meal and drinking from goblets while sitting at a folding table on Friday, the subway operator said.
"Although an eating ban was not written into the city's regulations for the Shanghai Metro system, the police will examine whether the behavior disturbed public order and the normal operation of the subway, and then decide if the foreigners will receive any punishment," said Yin Wei, media communications manager of Shanghai Shentong Metro Group.
Regulations came into effect in 2014 listing 11 forbidden behaviors, including interfering with a train and entering forbidden areas such as tunnels without permission - acts that can result in detention - and smoking or selling products on trains or platforms, which can result in fines of between 50 yuan and 500 yuan ($7 and $72). Other behaviors that disturb public safety and order may also be punished.
Police authorities declined to comment on Tuesday.
The incident, which has become an online sensation, was first exposed by a Sina Weibo user in a post on Friday.
The original post was deleted on Tuesday, but it had already been forwarded by individuals and media outlets. Many internet users have said the behavior was ridiculous and should be punished to prevent copycats.
"Foreigners shouldn't be treated in a more friendly way under our laws and regulations. Suppose the offenders were locals: I don't think they would have had the freedom to do such an unbelievable and unbearable thing at will in public," one netizen commented.
In 2014, Shanghai Metro encouraged people to ask others to refrain from eating on trains to avoid annoying fellow travelers.
"When finding someone eating on the subway, passengers can call our service hotline, alert the staff on the platforms or even call the police," Yin said.
In May, two men who drank while eating peanuts and eggs at a folding table they had brought into a subway carriage in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, were placed in detention for five days for disturbing public order.
The local police said their behavior violated municipal regulations.

Some people become online celebrities due to their good looks or good luck. But one young man has gained huge popularity on the internet because of his keen interest in natural history.
And his name is Zhang Chenliang.
Widely known as the "Man of Natural History", or Bowu Jun in Chinese, the online star now boasts 6 million followers on Sina Weibo, one of the most influential social media platforms in China.
Every day, he fields thousands of questions, ranging from entomology, zoology to botany and geography.
In the face of this question onslaught, Zhang has developed his own system for responding.
His fans know that this "walking encyclopedia" has a set of rules for answering questions and if you aren't clever, your question may sink to the bottom of the list like a pebble dropped into the sea.
Commenting on the ratings, Yu Le, 36, director of the series, says: "When people recommend a documentary, they always say something like 'It's a production by the BBC', but not this time."
Speaking about how the documentary series was made, he says: "Even the most familiar things look different from a height.
"We wanted to show how beautiful this familiar country is, and this was possible thanks to our time up in the air."

Wood fashioned into lace and sculpted into evening dresses: The Hanae Mori Manuscrit label led the way this Tokyo Fashion Week in showing the world the original craftsmanship that helps set Japan apart from the crowd. Dresses of persimmon-wood lace paired with soft falling black fabric were the star of the show at designer Yu Amatsu's autumn/winter 2017 collection for the brand that left fashionistas giddy with excitement.
Discs of chestnut and walnut were used on a dress of interlocking triangular panels, homage to Issey Miyake's iconic Bao Bao bag, while wood was fashioned into sleeve ties and delicate butterfly hair pieces.
Japan is famous for high-tech and specialty fabrics, which not only supply the likes of Chanel and other celebrated couture houses, but also provide constantly shifting inspiration for homegrown designers.
Misha Janette, a Tokyo-based stylist, creative director and blogger who has lived in Japan since 2004, says Japanese fashion was often less about entertainment and more thoughtful with "amazing" material.
"They're keen on working with young designers to create new fabrics ... that sets them apart," she says. "Each little village has its own special kind of fabric."
The 2017 Japan Film Week is being held in Beijing from April 16 to 23 in celebration of the 45th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.
A total of seven Japanese films have been brought to China to give Chinese audiences an inside look into Japanese society and culture.
The films, covering various subjects, try to reflect modern Japan through a series of everyday stories.
"Film, a recording of changes of society, has played an important role in the friendly exchanges between China and Japan. Also, we have seen that China has witnessed tremendous growth in its movie market and more Chinese movie-goers can take a look at our culture through films," Japanese Ambassador to China Yokoi Yutaka said.
More than 80 ministers, leaders of international organizations and business executives will attend the annual conference Boao Forum for Asia in Boao, Hainan province, from Thursday to Sunday. Let's take a look at some of the business leaders that will make an appearance.

XI'AN -- The northwestern Chinese city of Xi'an, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, is to appoint "toilet chiefs" this year, the city tourism bureau said Sunday.
The city aims to make all public toilets and those in restaurants and entertainment venues meet national standards in terms of sufficient numbers, and cleanliness. All public toilets should also be free of charge.
The city will attempt to contract management of toilets to private enterprises and individuals, with cleaning companies maintaining toilets more professionally.
The condition of toilets will be included in the assessment of tourist attractions and restaurants.
China is in the midst of a three-year "toilet revolution," building 33,500 new toilets and renovating 25,000 by the end of the year, according to the National Tourism Administration.
BEIJING -- China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels conducted a patrol in the territorial waters of the Diaoyu Islands on Sunday, according to the State Oceanic Administration website.
The vessels are CCG 2307, 2337 and 31239, according to the statement. China conducts such patrols on a regular basis.
BEIJING -- Seven years ago, the students at Hongban Elementary School baked potatoes and corn cobs over charcoal for lunch.
Recent additions to the school in Southwest China's Guizhou province have changed all that. A kitchen with refrigerators and disinfection equipment help provide nutritious lunches, including rice, vegetables, eggs and meat, for all 137 students each day.
China has worked hard in recent years to promote access to quality education for children in poverty-hit areas. The project reflects the improved school conditions of many children in poor areas mentioned by President Xi Jinping in his New Year speech.
BETTER MEALS
Life is much better for 12-year-old Jiajia than it was for her sister, who also attended Hongban Elementary School, thanks in large part to the nutrition program.
"My sister had to eat either potatoes or nothing," Jiajia said. "I'm luckier and growing taller."
Students like Jiajia are the primary targets of a large-scale program launched in 2011 to address malnutrition among students in remote and poor areas.
The government initially allocated three yuan (0.43 U.S. dollars) a day per student to supplement their diets with nutritious meals. This was increased to four yuan in 2015.
Over the past five years, the program has expanded to cover more than 1,500 counties around China, including the mountainous areas of Guizhou Province where Hongban school is located, benefiting 34 million students.
Prevalence of anemia among the students dropped by 8.9 percentage points from 2012 to 2015, data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention show. The students' physical fitness and academic performance have improved along with their nutrition.
BETTER FACILITIES
China has also upgraded facilities in areas with poor school conditions.
"Previously, all we had here was blackboard and chalk. I envied those urban students on TV who could attend classes in multi-media classrooms," said Li Na, an elementary school student from Zhao'an Township in Yan'an in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
Now each classroom in her school is equipped with projectors, a big LED screen and other technology.
"I'm overjoyed," Li said.
Wang Wenbo, a fifth grader at Chunguang Elementary School, no longer has to study in an old, dilapidated building.
"This new building looks the same as those in big cities," the boy said.
According to a plan released in 2013, the government aims to resolve foundational problems such as the shortage of desks, chairs, dorms and run-down school buildings in poor areas across the country within five years.
Since then, China has completed the construction of 81,000 schools and purchased nearly 17 million sets of desks and chairs and 101 million computers and other equipment.
A kindergarten in Jingbian County of Yulin, the northernmost city in Shaanxi, features a pink two-floor building, a playground, a wading pool, cages for small animals and a few miniature greenhouses for vegetables.
Jingbian County has implemented a tuition-free policy for kindergartners. The county has built or renovated more than 100 kindergartens in an effort to cover the majority of its towns and villages.
Kindergarten enrollment rates for the county are now over 90 percent.
Apart from the improved campus facilities, more educational resources are being used to enrich student life.
In the past three years, Gulniya, a 14-year-old girl of the Kirgiz ethnic group, has learned how to use a computer, paint and dance with her classmates in a small village in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
Gulniya can now play the electronic keyboard, something she had only seen on TV before.
"My dream is to become a Mandarin Chinese teacher," she said.

Cheng, now 16, was unable to walk after he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, when he was seven years old.
"It was in grade 2 (primary school) when I introduced Dongdong's situation to the students and asked if someone would volunteer to help him," said Wang Mi, the headmaster of Cheng's class.
In response, many students raised their hands, and Wang chose eight boys to form a special group to help Cheng. The group would take him to school and bring him back every day, help him at lunch and play with him during the breaks.
After seven years, Xie Chenxu, Liuwei and Liao Jiangtao of the group are still in the same class with Cheng at the middle school of Qiucun and help him. Xie takes charge of carrying Cheng in and out of the wheelchair as he is more muscular.
Later other classmates at the middle school also joined in the group to help Cheng.
Cheng's parents took him to many hospitals for treatment. A Canadian Chinese doctor began treating him and his situation has become better. The ALS is a global medical problem, and there is no cure yet.
LHASA -- Eight stone inscriptions found in Mangkam County in Southwest China's Tibet autonomous region have been confirmed as dating back to the Tibetan Tubo Kingdom more than 1,000 years ago, the county cultural relics bureau said Sunday.
The bureau along with the county tourist bureau and Sichuan University institute of Tibetan studies began research work in Mangkam County in the second half of 2016.
The eight stone inscriptions are all Buddhist figures whose style of dress is typical of the Tubo's upper classes.
"Judging from the costumes of the inscribed figures, we decide these inscriptions were made in the second half of the eighth century or the first half of the ninth," said Zhang Yanqing, an associate professor at the institute.
Archaeologists said the inscriptions reflect the communication between eastern and western culture during the Tubo period. They are also evidence of cultural communication and religious transmission between Tibetans and neighboring ethnic groups in ancient times.

Links found between air pollution and heart, respiratory and kidney problems
As China wages a long-term war against air pollution, the government is being urged to seriously study how air pollution, and smog in particular, impacts human health over the long term and deliver targeted interventions as soon as possible.
Real-time air monitoring by the Ministry of Environmental Protection showed that more than 60 percent of the 338 Chinese cities under surveillance experienced air pollution on Wednesday.
Nearly 25 percent of the cities, including Beijing, saw heavy smog, with AQI readings between 201 and 300.
The World Health Organization said air pollution continues to pose a threat to human health worldwide. About 2 million premature deaths annually can be attributed to its effects.
Wang Hufeng, head of the healthcare reform center of Renmin University of China, said China lacks surveillance, research and evidence-based evaluations of the health impact of the smog hitting increasing parts of China.
"It will be a long and tough war against air pollution, especially particulate matter, in the country and potential related health effects have to be monitored and studied scientifically and constantly," Wang said.
International studies on environmental health have found links between exposure to air pollution and heart, respiratory and kidney problems.
Xu Dongqun, deputy director of the institute of environmental health and related product safety at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the specific health impacts are also highly related to the varieties of the major pollutants.
Monitoring and research for smog-related health effects in the country are necessary to devise effective countermeasures to protect public health on smoggy days, she said. And that requires cooperation among government agencies of health, environmental protection and meteorology, she added.
Globally, the WHO in 2015 for the first time urged members to develop air quality monitoring systems and health registries to improve surveillance for all illnesses related to air pollution.
In response, China's top health authority pledged in late 2016 to set up 126 monitoring sites nationwide to study the effects of air pollution on health.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission has been researching correlations between health and smog, Ma Xiaowei, deputy head of the commission, told a news conference in December.
"This work is still in its primary stage, but we are losing no time," Ma said.
China has started smog risk assessments and a program on smog warning technology to identify typical pollutants that harm people's health and establish an evaluation system, he added.

BEIJING -- China's securities watchdog said it will attach greater importance to risk prevention in the stock market in 2017.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) will keep a close eye on financial conditions both at home and abroad and be prepared, said its assistant chairman Xuan Changneng.
He made the remarks Saturday at the 21th China Capital Market Forum on financial regulation, saying the CSRC has a bottom line of risk control.
The stock market in 2016 was much steadier compared with a year earlier, he said.
Only seven trading days registered changes beyond two percent from March to December last year, and the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained 15 percent in the period, he said.
The two stock exchanges both saw fluctuations of less than 10 percent in the second, third and fourth quarters, he added.
IPOs and refinancing by cash raised 1.33 trillion yuan ($190 billion) last year, up 59 percent. IPOs hit a five-year high, Xuan said.
The bond market also flourished, with non-financing enterprises issuing 2.87 trillion yuan of bonds last year, up 170 percent, he said.
Xuan said last year's progress was marked by action against wrongdoing as well as a vibrant market.
Lai Xiaomin, president of China Huarong Asset Management Co, a major state-owned asset management company, said financial risks were generally controllable, but challenges remain.
Lai, attending the same forum, highlighted the buildup of non-performing loans, a slower economy, shortage of liquidity and squeezed profit space as major risks.
He called for better corporate governance structure to hold directors and supervisors responsible, while stepping up regulation and granting greater authority to regulators.

At the National Science and Technology Awards Conference held in Beijing on January, 2017, Ren Xiaobin and his team won the second prize in the 2016 National Natural Science Award.
"It is the best time to do scientific research in China," said Ren. "China has a larger stage which provides more chances and room for growth. We can expand our ability and achieve greater value of life."
No one would expect Ren to achieve so much from nothing in only nine years. As one of the second batch of experts enlisted in the national "Recruitment Program of Global Experts", or Thousand Talents Program, he returned from Japan to establish the Frontier Institute of Science and Technology in Xi'an Jiaotong University and lead a group of young people to conduct research on intelligent material.
Ren is just one of the many outstanding examples of many overseas returnees. Since the program was introduced in 2008, more than 40,000 high-level talents have come back to homeland and have found jobs.
The number of returnees at professor level has been more than 20 times than that of the total number between 1978 and 2008, forming the biggest overseas returning wave since the founding of the People's Republic of China.
"We are close to realizing the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than any time in the history and we are eager for talents than any time in the history," said President Xi Jinping at the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Western Returned Scholars Association.
"Most overseas Chinese want to come back to China," said Wang Huiyao, vice-president of the Western Returned Scholars Association.
As China is improving its national strength, the ratio of the number of going abroad and returning people has fallen from 3.15:1 in 2006 to 1.28:1 in 2015. Talents are coming back at an unprecedented speed.
According to official statistics, more than 70 percent of project leaders working at key national research projects are overseas returnees. A large number of academicians at Chinese Academy of Sciences and at China Academy of Engineering are overseas returnees.
Experts estimate that China will transform from the biggest brain drain country into one of the main brain reversal countries in the world in five years.
The change of research environment is a major reason why overseas scholars are choosing to do research in China.
Shao Feng is in charge of a laboratory named after his name at the National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing. Two months ago, a research paper produced by his laboratory was published by world-known medical magazine Nature Microbiology, achieving a major breakthrough in the field of bioscience.
Shao said the key to success is that the laboratory is run in a similar mode to international scientific research institutes, breaking the constraints such as budget report, assessment standard, which are usually seen in the traditional management of scientific research.
Favorable policies, exploding high-tech industry, innovative atmosphere and sustainable investment are appealing to more and more overseas students.
Currently, there are more than 300 overseas returnees' pioneer parks and about 24,000 enterprises in the parks across the country, with about 24,000 overseas returnees being employed.
"Many ask me why I came back. My answer is simple: I'm still young and I want to pursue my dream," said Zhu Xiang, 30, who turned down the offer of a research institute in France to start his own business in China.
Zhu with his friends established a mobile medical platform at an incubator in Tsinghua University and now has millions of users. He thinks the fast-growing China now has a very good platform for overseas returnees to realize their aspiration.




BEIJING  -- China's resort island province of Hainan aimed to achieve growth of over 7 percent this year, after a 7.5-percent expansion in 2016, as its legislative session closed Friday.
Like Hainan, 20 other provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities lowered or maintained their growth targets this year, indicating the basic tone of "seeking progress while maintaining stability" as set by the central economic work conference in December.
To date, all provincial-level regions have concluded their annual meetings for local lawmakers and political advisors.
The new measures in reform, opening up and structural adjustment announced at local sessions have raised high expectations for the annual sessions of China's top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), and the top political advisory body, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in March.
The two meetings are among the most important political events in China,second only to the 19th National Congress of Communist Party of China (CPC) later this year, at which a new leadership of the Party will be elected.
The people's congress system, the country's political basis, has been in place for over six decades at the national, provincial, prefectural, county and township levels.
The NPC has nearly 3,000 deputies from provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, and the People's Liberation Army. Its annual session deliberates and approves the economic and social development plan among other major policies, laws and regulations.
The new economic growth target to be announced at the opening meeting of the legislative session on March 5 will be of note.
China's economy has been continuing its slowdown trend. It reported 6.7 percent GDP growth in 2016, the lowest level in nearly three decades, but likely to top all other major economies. China aims to achieve average annual growth of more than 6.5 percent over the 2016 to 2020 period.
A framework of "new normal" is being introduced to inject new vitality into the economy and ensure more balanced growth.
The provincial growth targets in 2017 will leave room for governments to push on with transformation and supply-side structural reform, including slashing overcapacity in sectors like coal and steel. All these are critical for China to achieve a sustained and healthy economic growth.
Coal-rich Shanxi and central Henan both aim to cut 20 million tonnes of coal capacity this year, after each slashed 23 million tonnes last year.
Hebei, which neighbors Beijing and produces a quarter of the country's iron and steel, aims to further slash 32 million tonnes of steel capacity this year, after a similar level of reduction in 2016.
"This year will be our toughest for capacity reduction. No matter how difficult it is, we are determined to succeed," said Hebei Governor Zhang Qingwei.
Environmental protection is another key item on the agenda, with new pollution treatment targets and measures included in local government work plans.
Beijing, a frequent victim of smog, aims to cut its PM2.5 density by 18 percent to 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air this year, at a planned cost of 18 billion yuan ($2.6 billion dollars).
China's opening-up is expected to gain new momentum this year, as the provinces and municipalities with free trade zones (FTZs) push forward and refine the FTZ system.
There will also be more projects under the Belt and Road Initiative.
Commodity and service centers will be set up in Shanghai this year to boost trade with countries along the Belt and Road. The city signed construction contracts worth 8.9 billion dollars with countries along the ancient trade route last year, up 66 percent year on year.
Moreover, southwestern Sichuan province plans to double the frequency of cargo trains bound for Europe to 1,000 this year. Foreign investment into the inland province hit 8.5 billion dollars in 2016, featuring projects from 17 of the world's top 500 companies.
"China is opening wider to the outside world and it is paying off with win-win results for all those involved," said Xu Yaotong, a professor from the Chinese Academy of Governance.
Reviving the real economy was a hot topic at the local sessions of provincial lawmakers.
Zhejiang Vice Governor Feng Fei said the province would help lower the costs for companies this year so that more resources can be distributed to the real economy.
Poverty alleviation remains a pressing task. Southwestern Yunnan province will bring 1 million of the 3.5 million poor people above the poverty line in 2017.
To achieve "Xiaokang," or a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, by 2020, this year China will help another 10 million people out of over 45.7 million get rid of poverty.
New government heads of at least 11 provincial-level regions, including Beijing and Shanghai, were elected at the local sessions. These regions' combined GDP exceeds that of Germany.
Notably, local two sessions also stressed the "four consciousnesses" -- the ideology, the whole, the core and the line.
Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, was endorsed as the core leader at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in late October.
"It is natural to stress the concept. The centralized and unified leadership is gaining consensus," said Dai Yanjun, of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.




Liao Luqiang, a taxi driver in Southwest China's Chongqing city, takes selfies with passengers.Photo Provided To China Daily
What would you do if a taxi driver asked to take a picture with you? Well, if you visit Chongqing in Southwest China you might just find out.
Liao Luqiang, a 31-year-old originally from Suining, Sichuan province, has been driving a taxi in Chongqing for about eight years.
He finds his job interesting because of all the different people he gets to meet, but in recent years he has detected rising levels of anxiety and upset in his cab.
So on April 27, 2015, he began a project called Smile Selfie, in a bid to brighten his passengers' days.
"People always smile when taking selfies," he said.
"I just want to cheer my passengers up and put a little light back into their day with smiles and happiness."
Over the past 22 months, Liao has taken more than 300 pictures with his passengers and posted them to his account on Sina Weibo, China's answer to Twitter.
He is always careful not to be too pushy and tries his best to get to know his passengers first before asking to take a picture with them.
"The atmosphere in the car can become very depressed if the passengers are in a bad mood," he said. "I really want to make them happy during the short time they are with me."
The first photo Liao took was with a man in his 70s, who posed with the V-sign hand gesture in front of his forehead.
"Usually young people and seniors are more likely to accept the idea," he said. "Middle-aged people are more cautious."
Some young women are inordinately picky about their photos and will want several taken from different angles, Liao said, so to make the selfies more beautiful, he has learned some photographic tricks from his wife and bought a new cellphone with automatic photo - editing functions.
Still, about half his passengers turn down his requests for a picture.
One day, Liao was rejected by three middle-aged people in a row.
"I got so upset I nearly gave up," he said.
But he is inspired to keep going by the people who follow his social media account, such as Teng Jiazhi, a retired taxi driver in Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning province.
"Many people appreciate my project and I will try my best to bring more happiness to my little cab," Liao said.
He now plans to make a photograph album filled with the selfies he has taken and put a copy in his taxi for his passengers to admire.

The national leadership continues to implement changes designed to foster a fitter, leaner economy. Xinhua reports.
Yang Yuxiang had planned to leave his job as a rural school teacher in Hunan province, Central China, for a position in a city school, but changed his mind after the central government began to implement measures to improve rural education.
"I don't need to look for a new job now because the school will be renovated, and rural teachers, like me, now qualify for attractive remuneration packages," he said.
Measures have been rolled out across the country to close the gap between rural and urban education, including better pay for rural teachers and better facilities for rural schools.
Education reform is just one element of the country's extensive reform drive. Last year, 97 key reform tasks were completed, 419 reform plans were drafted and frameworks for reform in major sectors were drawn up.
There is little sign of the reform drive losing steam in the new year. Just days after the start of the Lunar New Year, President Xi Jinping chaired a meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform to chart the course for further changes.
At the meeting, Xi said leading Communist Party of China and government officials are central to the national reform drive. They must act to "shoulder the heaviest burden, and chew on the hardest bones", he said.
Xi has taken the lead. More than four years after taking the helm of China, reform has emerged as a hallmark of his administration.
Comprehensively deepening reform is one of the "Four Comprehensives", a strategic blueprint drawn up by Xi that creates pathways to realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation.
He also went to great lengths to make his vision of reform a reality. Xi's first trip outside Beijing as the leader of the CPC was to Guangdong province, the forefront of China's decades-long reform and opening-up drive.
"Reforms are always in the present tense, not the past tense," Xi has said.
Last year, he visited Xiaogang village, often referred to as the birthplace of rural reform, in Anhui province, East China, where he called for a solid agricultural sector and improved conditions for farmers.
In July, during an event to mark the 95th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, Xi said reform and opening-up will be crucial to deciding the fate of modern China.
Measures drafted by the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform have been designed to address issues such as urbanization, poverty alleviation, innovation and the market's role in resource allocation.
"These reform measures are so wide-reaching that they touch the lives of all Chinese," said Xu Guangjian, vice-dean of the school of public administration and policy at Renmin University of China.
"In this sense, China's current reform drive is more than just a venture of the ruling party. It represents the common aspirations of the entire people," he said.
Sense of gain
The general objectives of reform are improving socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernizing the State governance system, according to a communique issued after the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in 2013.
This vision includes promoting social equity and justice, and improving the well-being of the people.
In his New Year address, Xi said his top priority was helping the poor.
Xi, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has presided over 32 meetings of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform since its inception.
Poverty alleviation, healthcare, employment and education were among the key issues discussed at the meetings, which aimed to improve the lives of the people.
"The ongoing reform drive is not just reform for reform's sake," said Xin Ming, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
Xin said the four years after the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012 have marked a new phase in the country's reform as it becomes more systematic, interlinked and coordinated: "The reform now focuses more on increasing people's sense of gain. It is becoming more solution-based and more law-based."
In Xi's own words, reform must be focused on issues of public concern. It must serve to resolve outstanding problems in ordinary people's lives and meet their demands and needs. It should be carried out by the people, and for the people.
Eliminating poverty is the first and key step in improving people's lives.
Last year, tailored measures were designed for, and implemented in, the country's impoverished areas - including a program that allocates profits from local hydropower plants and mining projects to the local people.
Thanks to an array of measures, an additional 10 million people were lifted out of poverty last year, taking the nation one step closer to lifting its remaining 45 million rural poor people out of poverty by 2020.
Along with the poverty-relief program, other endeavors to help improve the lives of the population are taking shape.
More medical resources have been provided to close the gap in health services for children, and family doctors are introducing more people to health management. Rural education is also being improved to help students compete with their urban peers, while the design of care services for seniors is being improved to cater to the needs of the elderly.
Major projects
At the 14th meeting of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economic Affairs in December, Xi was briefed on progress in a number of major projects, including: promoting clean winter heating in northern areas; implementing a waste sorting program in eastern Zhejiang province; disposal and recycling of livestock residue; improving the quality of services in nursing homes for seniors; regulating the rental market for residential properties; curbing property bubbles; and improving oversight of food safety.
"The fundamental goal of maintaining the pace of growth and promoting economic development is to seek proper solutions to prominent issues of common concern to the people," Xi, who heads the central leading group, said.
Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way by addressing people's concerns is in line with the need to push forward supply-side structural reform, Xi said, adding that this would also help to nurture new sources of growth and increase potential.
China embarked on its reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s, and reform has remained a key theme of the country's development ever since.
But nearly 40 years later, the reform drive is now in a deep-water zone because many of the easier reforms have been accomplished, leaving the difficult tasks.
Efforts have been made to focus more on top-level design of reforms and on "key minorities", a term first used in 2015 that refers to the small group of officials at provincial and ministerial level who have both power and responsibilities.
According to Xi, leading Party and government officials must practice what they preach to ensure that reforms are fully implemented.
The president has highlighted the importance of implementation on a number of occasions.
According to Xi, leading officials should be both the promoters and practitioners of reform. Reform may bring sharp yet brief pain, but without it the pain will last much longer.
So far, a wide range of areas has been improved, with notable advances in the reform of the judiciary, the fields of fiscal management and taxation, State-owned enterprises and the military.
In the economic sphere, Xi has promised extensive supply-side structural reform.

A survey carried out by China Central Television indicates that those born in the 1990s and those above 60 are more confident about their financial health, reported chinanews.com.
This year's survey shows that 16 percent of post-1990s and 13 percent of those aged above 60 are confident about their financial prospects.
According to previous surveys, the confidence in income in 2015 rebounded to the highest point in recent years.
In terms of investment, Chinese households are relatively risk averse, with 35 percent investing in nothing. The most popular financial products are insurances – nearly two in five people chose to spend on them.
The survey also shows that 46 percent of respondents prefer to spend on tourism, leading in various kinds of consumption choices.
More than half said they "are under much pressure from work, and have no time to exercise". At the same time, 34 percent said they buy heath care products and services.
When it comes to attitudes toward the second-child policy, 24 percent of respondents said they do not plan to have another child in short term due to economic pressure.
The survey collects feedbacks from 100,000 Chinese households in 104 cities across the country by sending them post cards with questionnaires. This year, big data technology was applied in the survey.
The detailed information about the survey will be aired on CCTV next month.

CAIRO - Argentine footballer Lionel Messi arrived in Cairo on Tuesday to promote a new treatment for Hepatitis C virus, according to a source at Cairo International Airport.
The visit was deemed as part of "Tour n' Cure" international tourism initiative launched under the slogan of "For a World Free of Virus C," it said.
The source also noted that Messi arrived at Cairo West International Airport, making him to stay near the Pyramids of Giza and close to the nearby Mena House Hotel where he will show up for a ceremony.
The soccer superstar, who plays for Spanish club FC Barcelona, or "Barca," was scheduled to arrive in Egypt last week but the trip was delayed after his team suffered an overnight massive 0-4 loss to Paris Saint-Germain.
The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism pins hope on Messi's "historic visit" to be one of the steps towards enhancing the tourism sector in Egypt that has been suffering recession over the past few years due to political turmoil and relevant security issues.
"Such visits by international public figures, undoubtedly, pour in favor of Egypt and serve its tourism sector significantly," said the Egyptian ministry in a previous statement.




 
Electric motor racing appeals to participants for a variety of reasons - not the least of which is its potential for reshaping the future of urban transportation.
Oliver Turvey of China-backed team NextEV Nio is one of the growing legion of Formula E drivers intrigued by the prospect of adopting fancy track technologies to electric-powered road cars.
The London native, who joined NextEV in 2015, had the good fortune to test drive EP9, the Chinese startup company's latest road-legal electric super car, on the famous Nurburgring track in Germany in October.
EP9's lap time of 7.05 minutes smashed all previous electric-vehicle (EV) records.
A two-year veteran of Formula E, Turvey is still fascinated by that trial run in what is claimed to be the world's fastest EV.
"I am really proud of racing for NextEV Nio. It's exciting to be part of a new electric car company in China," Turvey told China Daily after the Buenos Aires ePrix in the Argentine capital on Feb 18.
"I think their plans are really exacting about the cars they develop. We are fortunate to drive EP9. It's phenomenally fast."
Turvey finished ninth with two ranking points in Buenos Aires, the third stop on the championship's 12-race season.
Founded in 2014, NextEV has assembled design, engineering and manufacturing teams in Munich, London and Shanghai for road EV development while operating the Formula E program.
EP9 is the first trickle-down of Formula E racing technology into a road car, which is exactly the aim of established manufacturers such as Jaguar and Audi that are competing in the young championship.
"I think what we accomplish on the race track is helping develop our powertrain and other systems. When you are competing against others, it's always going to drive the development of the road car. That's something I enjoy the most," said Turvey, who earned an engineering degree from Cambridge University.
With new regulations adopted by Formula E almost every year to allow manufacturers to fine-tune race cars on their own, Turvey said the open race will only accelerate the tech evolution for civil use.
"It's an exciting championship. It's new technologies developing new powertrains that are very beneficial for electric road cars, which are the future in cities around the world. It's great to be part of this championship and to race in these great cities," said Turvey.

China and France signed an agreement to recognizing the validity of driving licenses issued by each other, in Beijing Tuesday.
Under the agreement, China and France will allow holders of valid driving licenses issued by either authorities to drive directly or obtain driving permits without an additional test, the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) said.
The agreement, signed by the MPS and French Interior Ministry, will take effect 90 days after ratification.
It will benefit overseas Chinese living in France as well as people who travel, study, work or visit their families there, and boost cooperation and exchanges between China and France, said the MPS.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's administration plans to consider almost all illegal immigrants subject to deportation, but will leave protections in place for immigrants known as "dreamers" who entered the United States illegally as children, according to official guidelines released on Tuesday.
The Department of Homeland Security guidance to immigration agents is part of a broader border security and immigration enforcement plan in executive orders that Republican Trump signed on Jan 25.
Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, issued an executive order in 2012 that protected 750,000 immigrants who had been brought into the United States illegally by their parents. Trump has said the issue is "very difficult" for him.
Trump campaigned on a pledge to get tougher on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, playing on fears of violent crime while promising to build a wall on the border with Mexico and to stop potential terrorists from entering the country.
Trump's planned measures against illegal immigrants have drawn protests, such as an event last week that activists called "A Day Without Immigrants" to highlight the importance of foreign-born people, who account for 13 percent of the US population, or more than 40 million naturalized American citizens.
A banner declaring "Refugees Welcome" was posted on the base of the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of American acceptance of immigrants, before park rangers removed it on Tuesday, WABC television reported.
DHS officials, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said that although any immigrant in the country illegally could be deported, the agency will prioritize those deemed as posing a threat.
These include recent entrants, those convicted of a crime and people charged but not convicted. Some details of the guidelines were detailed in a draft memo seen on Saturday.

A large information database and a pool of expert resources are being built to facilitate the sharing of resources and promote studies on the development of the proposed Yangtze River economic belt.
"Many universities along the Yangtze River economic belt have carried out their own studies and research, based on different reaches of the river. Such studies are relatively separate," said Chen Yugang, professor and head of the liberal arts department at Fudan University in Shanghai.
"We hope to establish an integrated study platform that will allow all the universities along the belt to share and exchange information and resources to boost the productivity of research in this field."
In December, Fudan University initiated a cooperative think tank working alliance for the development of the economic belt, with the participation of 12 universities and research institutes.
The alliance's main task will be to provide high-quality reports for the government and businesses to aid the development of the economic belt and promote the exchange and cultivation of talent.
"So far, we have already carried out studies related to ecological restoration and environmental protection of the Yangtze River water system. Meanwhile, the alliance will also promote scientific and technological innovation and collaboration between industry and academics in the belt," Chen said, adding that more universities have been encouraged to join.
The Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Institute at Fudan University is currently working as the academic service body for all members of the alliance. The development institute was jointly established by the university and the cooperation and exchange department of the Shanghai municipal government in October 2015.
So far, the institute has established three multidimensional data platforms that provide accurate reflections of the social and economic conditions along the river. For example, the Yangtze River Economy and Society Development Database provides information about more than 110 cities at the prefecture-level and above in the proposed economic belt. The database includes hundreds of indicators in fields such as population, economic development and business development.
To promote the development of the economic belt, the 11 provinces and cities along the river will need to address a range of problems, such as planning ecological and environment protection programs.
They will also need to exploit the economic benefits provided by the river, balance development across areas, boost industrial transformation and upgrade via scientific innovation, as well as developing a regional cooperative and coordinating a working mechanism, according to Liu Chenggong, deputy Party head at Fudan University.
Intensive research should be carried out to formulate comprehensive, systematic policies, Liu added. The alliance will also hold a think tank forum annually to attract wider attention to ecological protection and the economic belt's development, and to boost the development of green innovation.
Starting next month, square dancers in Beijing could risk legal repercussions if they are deemed to be disturbing the peace, Chinanews.com reported.
Beijing's newly revised regulation on the national fitness program stipulates that fitness activities should not disturb the public order, and violators will be subject to penalties or even criminal prosecution at the hands of public security departments.
With public square dancing becoming increasingly popular among Chinese citizens, and especially among senior citizens, disputes between dancers and residents have been on the rise, as the dancing is usually accompanied by loud music.
Places including Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and the cities of Xi'an and Nachong have already formulated regulations controlling fitness activities in public places. These regulations, however, do not designate specific departments to oversee square dancing.
Beijing's new regulation demonstrates the government's commitment to solving the problems caused by square dancing, and is a good example of resolving disputes through law, the report noted.

BEIJING - Fifteen Chinese listed brokerages have estimated profit declines for the last year as thin stock trading dragged down their incomes in commission fees.
Those brokerages, accounting for more than half of the country's publicly traded securities firms, reported combined net profits of 53.66 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) in their preliminary earnings estimates for 2016, only half of the figure seen in 2015, according to RoyalFlush Information, a financial information service provider.
Their total revenues declined nearly 40 percent to 164.87 billion yuan, mainly weighed on by substantial drops in commission fees.
Chinese shares were still in the middle of a sluggish recovery from sharp plunges, prompting investors to be more cautious in making transactions, while booming property sales also drained money from the stock market.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index stood at 3,103.64 points at the end of 2016, down 12.31 percent year on year.
Changjiang Securities Co saw the lowest profit decline, while CITIC Securities Co appeared to be the most profitable brokerage.
Despite lackluster brokerage charges, securities companies saw expanding asset management and investment banking business last year, which grew 8 percent and 29 percent in terms of net income, respectively, data from the Securities Association of China showed.
A domestic Chinese airline shared a humorous microblog post on Tuesday afternoon, claiming that its flights were delayed because workers had "dug the wrong plane out of the snow".
The post, from Lucky Air, was accompanied by a photograph, allegedly showing three men shoveling snow off a plane belonging to the airline at Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport in Central China's Henan province.
It was posted at about 3:30 pm and received a flurry of "likes" and shares, but has since been deleted.
Shi Shufang, a worker at the airport, said the post had left them confused because Tuesday's snow was not as heavy as that shown in the picture.
"We called the airline and they explained that the microblog was just a humorous way of easing passengers' anxiety about flight delays," Shi said.
Snowfall caused 99 delays and 137 cancellations at the airport in Zhengzhou on Tuesday, according to Dahe Daily.

SYDNEY - The pilot of a plane that crashed into a Melbourne shopping center on Tuesday was already under investigation over a "near collision", it has been revealed.
Max Quartermain, 63, and his four passengers were killed after the charter plane they were on ploughed into the Direct Factory Outlet (DFO) shopping center in Essendon in Melbourne's north at 09:00 am local time on Tuesday.
Witnesses of the crash described seeing a "massive fireball" erupt from the crash scene as debris scattered across the nearby Tullamarine freeway.
The plan experienced "catastrophic engine failure" soon after taking off from Essendon airport bound for King Island, a popular golf tourist destination, with Quartermain and four passengers from the United States on board.
The passengers have been identified as Texas businessmen John Washburn, Greg De Haven, Russell Munsch and Glenn Garland.
It has been revealed that Quartermain was the subject of an investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) regarding a near miss with another plane at Mount Hotham, 350 kms north-east of Melbourne in September 2015.
A summary of the investigation said that Quartermain's plane, with the call signal VH-OWN, came within 100 meters of colliding with another plane mid-air in bad weather.
It said that Quartermain's plane experienced "tracking difficulties" as it approached Hotham.
"VH-OWN was then observed to carry out significant manoeuvring while on short final to the runway before landing," the report said.
The revelation that Quartermain was under investigation came as Michael Buxton, a planning expert at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) said that the commercial precinct should have never been built on the site.

Popular brands, including Burberry, Mulberry, British Airways and Durex, are among British companies successfully using instant messaging application WeChat in the Chinese market.
Christopher Bailey, Burberry's chief creative officer, said: "WeChat opens up a huge new world of opportunity in the digital space. The exciting thing for us is the deeper and more meaningful way that we are able to tell our stories using this platform."
Burberry lets users view London Fashion Week catwalk shows on the app, listen to translated interviews with executives, and snap up digital vouchers and promotions.
British companies know they can reach Chinese consumers through social media. In 2016, WeChat had 768 million daily logged-in users, and 60 percent of Chinese shoppers searched Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, for brand information.
But cracking Chinese online platforms is a tough task. Many Western brands have learnt the hard way that engaging Chinese users is not as simple as copying and pasting a translated post from Instagram or Facebook.
While British people might use Facebook to connect with friends, Twitter to share an article, and Apple Pay to buy a coffee, Chinese users might rely on WeChat to do all of them, and more.

Anne-Marie Verdin, brand director at Mulberry, said: "We are constantly looking for new platforms to communicate the depth and breadth of the Mulberry brand and tell the Mulberry story to our consumers.
"WeChat's advanced functionality and prominence in the daily lives of consumers means this will be a central tool to communicate with our audience in China."
Despite such success stories, WeChat is not a surefire way to crack the Chinese market, according to Domenica di Lieto, CEO of Emerging Communications, a digital agency with offices in London and Shanghai.
"There is a lot of misunderstanding about WeChat, people think it's the holy grail," said Di Lieto. "WeChat will only work if you've built up a following in the first place."
 
LONDON - Average life expectancy will rise in many countries by 2030, breaking through 90 years in some places, and policymakers need to make more efforts to plan for it, according to a large international study.
South Koreans are likely to have the highest life expectancy in the world by 2030 and the United States one of the lowest among developed countries, the study showed.
"The fact that we will continue to live longer means we need to think about strengthening the health and social care systems to support an ageing population with multiple health needs," said Majid Ezzati, the lead researcher and a professor at Imperial College London's school of public health.
Led by Imperial scientists in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the study found that among high-income countries, the United States is likely to have the lowest life expectancy in 2030, with men and women expecting to live 79.5 and 83.3 years respectively - similar to middle-income countries like Croatia and Mexico.
This was partly due to a lack of universal healthcare in the United States, and also due to factors such as relatively high child and maternal mortality rates, and high rates of homicides and obesity, the study said.
In Europe, French women and Swiss men were predicted to have the highest life expectancies, averaging 88.6 years for French women and nearly 84 years for Swiss men.
South Korea came out top of the predictions, with the researchers predicting a girl born in South Korea in 2030 should expect to live 90.8 years, while a boy could reach 84.1 years.
"Many people used to believe that 90 years is the upper limit for life expectancy, but this research suggests we will break the 90-year-barrier," Ezzati said.
"We repeatedly hear that improvements in human longevity are about to come to an end.. (but) I don't believe we're anywhere near the upper limit of life expectancy - if there even is one."
The study, published in The Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, covered 35 developed and emerging countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Australia, Poland, Mexico and the Czech Republic.
South Korea's much greater average life expectancy would be due to several factors including good childhood nutrition, low blood pressure, low levels of smoking and good access to healthcare, new medical knowledge and technologies, the researchers said.
China's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and France's Ministry of the Interior signed a reciprocity agreement in Beijing on Feb 21 to make official the mutual recognition of each country's driver's licenses.
According to the agreement, Chinese and French driver's licenses will be automatically recognized as valid in France and China respectively for those who stay in the country for less than one year. Holders of Chinese licenses in France can legally drive as long as they hold a valid Chinese driver's license and a translated version. Holders of valid French driver's licenses in China can apply for temporary driving approval, which exempts them from the physical examination and test otherwise required for a license.
Drivers are still required to drive only the approved type of motor vehicle clearly stated on their licenses. The types include medium passage cars, large freight cars, small cars and motorcycles.
For those living abroad for more than one year, there is an option to apply for a new driver's license without sitting for examinations by presenting documents including one's passport, visa or residential documents.  
Both sides offer preferential policies for diplomats and international students. Chinese diplomats and students in France can drive a corresponding type of vehicles with a valid Chinese driver's license and its translated version throughout their stay. French diplomats and students with French drivers' licenses in China can apply for a Chinese license without taking any exams.
An official from traffic management bureau under the MPS stated that the reciprocity agreement will go into effect 90 days after both parties sign the agreement and complete domestic legal procedures.
The new measure is an important indicator of deepening public security reform in China. Previously, China has created reciprocity with Belgium and the United Arab Emirates. China is now actively seeking to cooperate with more countries to benefit the lives of all expatriates.








Sacramento pulls off multi-player deal to send All-Star to Pelicans
SACRAMENTO - Sacramento Kings general manager Vlade Divac headed into All-Star weekend convinced it was finally time to part ways with ultra-talented center DeMarcus Cousins.
Befitting a franchise that appears headed to a 11th straight season without a playoff berth, the Kings even seemed to botch that.
On Sunday, Sacramento dealt Cousins and forward Omri Casspi to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Tyreke Evans, 2016 first-round draft pick Buddy Hield, Langston Galloway and first- and second-round draft picks this summer.

When asked why he didn't wait for a better offer closer to Thursday's trade deadline, Divac gave a curious response that raised more questions than it answered.
"Most likely we would get less because I had a better deal two days ago," Divac said. "I don't want to go into details. I don't want to discuss the process."
Cousins will now team Anthony Davis, another former Kentucky big man who has developed into an NBA All-Star in New Orleans.
Cousins has averaged 27.8 points and 10.6 rebounds this season and can become a free agent in 2018 unless the Pelicans can sign him to an All-Star caliber extension.
The Kings have not won more than 33 games in a season since drafting Cousins fifth overall in 2010 and they grew tired of his antics that included frequent run-ins with coaches, media personnel and officials.
He leads the NBA with 17 technical fouls this season, leading to a one-game suspension earlier this month. He will be suspended again after his next technical foul and every two beyond that for the remainder of the regular season.
Divac frequently mentioned culture and character when explaining the thought behind the deal, saying the franchise needed a change despite being only 1 1/2 games behind Denver for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
"I really love DeMarcus," Divac said. "I think he's a great kid. It just wasn't a fit right now with what we're trying to do. I wish him all the best. I hope this will have a positive effect on his career."
The deal to pair Cousins with Davis sends a message that the Pelicans are more concerned with making a 25-game push for the playoffs this spring then where they'll be drafting next offseason.
New Orleans GM Dell Demps' previous attempts to provide Davis a requisite supporting cast has been under increasing scrutiny as losses have mounted. The Pelicans are 23-34, 2 1/2 games out of the final playoff spot in the West with 25 games left.
When the deal was made official on Monday, Demps thanked Pelicans owner Tom Benson and top executives Mickey Loomis and Dennis Lauscha for their "continued support and providing the resources for us to be successful".
"This is an exciting time for Pelicans fans as we continue our quest for long-term success," Demps said.
The Kings, who are a game ahead of the Pelicans in the standings, will now enter rebuilding mode without Cousins.
Sacramento could deal other veterans for prospects or picks before Thursday's deadline, but even the rebuilding plan has issues.
The Kings could be forced to swap first-round picks with Philadelphia this year and also owe the 76ers an unprotected 2019 pick as part of a trade in July 15 made to create salary-cap room to sign Rajon Rondo, Kosta Koufos and Marco Belinelli. Only Koufos is still in Sacramento.
This trade does increase the Kings' chances at two first-round picks this year because they only have to give up their top pick to Chicago if it falls outside the top 10.
"We feel very strong about this draft this year," Divac said. "It's very strong, stronger than the past few years. It's time to start fresh."
The Kings also get the 23-year-old Hield, who won the Wooden Award at Oklahoma last year before being drafted sixth overall by the Pelicans.
Hield has struggled as a rookie, averaging 8.6 points per game in 20.4 minutes per contest, while shooting 39.2 percent from the field and 36.9 percent from 3-point range.
"He's talented guy," Divac said. "His work ethic is exactly what we want here."
Evans, who can play point guard, shooting guard or small forward, will be entering a second stint in Sacramento, where he was drafted in 2009 and went on to be NBA rookie of the year. Galloway has been a solid reserve, providing scoring punch from the perimeter. Casspi has been playing about 19 minutes a game for the Kings this season, averaging 5.9 points.

Ensuring cyber security should be a high priority as China steps up efforts to promote the development of the industrial internet, experts said.
Qi Xiangdong, president of Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd, China's biggest internet security company, said compared with consumer internet applications such as e-commerce, the industrial internet is far more complex and more vulnerable to sophisticated cyber attacks.
"Once the industrial internet is attacked by 'bad guys', it not only compromises personal information, it also harms the whole enterprise," Qi said.
The industrial internet is a network that combines advanced machines with internet-connected sensors and big-data analytics. It is designed to boost productivity, efficiency, and reliability of industrial production.
Qihoo 360 has unveiled an online platform to warn enterprises of cyber attacks. So far, the platform has 82 enterprises on board.
Xu Yingbo, an analyst at Citic Securities Co, forecasts the Chinese industrial internet market will exceed 450 billion yuan ($65.4 billion) by 2020.
The industrial internet is highlighted in the country's Made in China 2025 strategy, which was designed to promote high-end manufacturing.
Liu Duo, head of the government think tank, China's Academy of Information and Communications Technology, said Chinese enterprises vary significantly when it comes to their automation level.
"Some factories are smart and fully automated, while others are at an initial stage," Liu said.
"But all of them need to raise awareness of the cyber security at production lines," she added.
In 2017, China's economic growth trend will keep an "L shape" but may transfer from a steep drop to a relatively steady, flat line, according to Li Wei, director of the Development Research Center of the State Council.
"China's economy was quite stable in 2016. On a year-on-year basis, the producer price index and corporate profits increased and the unemployment rate declined. To a large extent, the risk of a rapid decline in China's economic growth rate is reducing while the stable factors are increasing. Thus, it is hopeful that the L-shaped growth trend may transit to a relatively smooth flat line," Li told a recent forum hosted by the research center on Saturday.
According to Li, China's economy is expected to witness a slight fall in the growth rate of investment, steady growth in consumption and the exports situation going from negative to positive in 2017.
The economic restructuring of 2016 has achieved its initial goal, with several important indicators beginning to show growth. China's economy is expected to begin a relatively stable high-speed growth stage in the medium to long term.
Zhang Junkuo, deputy director of the center, said at the forum that the current economic situation presents a trend of being stable while becoming more positive. The number of positive factors in economic growth is increasing and the growth rate is stable and set to rebound, especially when China's economy "still has the great potential to achieve high-speed growth".
However, contradictions and problems are still present. The risk of downturn still exists and the basis for stabilization and recovery is not too strong. "We must keep a clear understanding and continue finding more effective resolutions," Zhang said.
Supply-side structural reform, which was launched in 2016, has played a positive role in adjusting the economic structure and improving market expectations. The reform encourages cutting overcapacity, destocking, deleveraging, reducing corporate costs and shoring up weak spots.
"Judging from the changes in economic operation, the structural reform of the supply side needs to be further deepened in 2017," Li said.
For instance, with regard to cutting overcapacity, Li mentioned it is important to deal with "zombie enterprises" and take marketing and legal action to deal with inefficient production capacity. To destock, the key is to adhere to the idea that a house is not for selling but for living in, so that people can enjoy the purpose of the house – living.
"There is great potential for China's economy to grow in a high speed," Zhang said. "As long as we can adjust policies according to the changing situation, deepen reform in key areas and make effort to build a mechanism of economic growth under the new normal."
HAVANA - Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday met with a visiting delegation of bipartisan US senators and representatives, the first high-level US delegation since President Donald Trump took office about a month ago.
Cuba's state TV quoted an official government release as saying that Castro and the visiting US congressmen, including Democrat Senator Patrick Leahy and Republican Senator Thad Cochran, talked about topics concerning the "common interests of both countries." The release did not reveal more details.
Castro was accompanied by Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and Foreign Trade and Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca.
The US delegation earlier met separately with Rodriguez and Malmierca as well as Agriculture Minister Gustavo Rodriguez.
Leahy has been one of the main proponents of normalizing relations with Cuba, while Cochran from the southern state of Mississippi has publicly endorsed Trump in the Senate.
Cochran is a co-sponsor in the Senate of a bill aimed at expanding agricultural exports to Cuba. The legislation would lift the ban on granting private credit to finance agricultural sales to the island, and thus seek greater access by US farmers to the Cuban market.
The congressional trip took place just over one month after the inauguration of Trump, who has promised to review the state of relations with Cuba.

Magic Johnson was named the president of basketball operations for the struggling Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday as one of the NBA's most storied franchises undergoes a major shakeup to the their front office.
In addition to promoting Johnson, a Hall of Famer who won five NBA titles with Los Angeles in the 1980s, Lakers Governor Jeanie Buss fired longtime general manager Mitch Kupchak and her brother, Jim, from his role as vice president of basketball operations.
"I took these actions today to achieve one goal: Everyone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by Earvin and myself," said Jeanie Buss. "We are determined to get back to competing to win NBA championships again."
Kupchak was in his 30th season working in the team's front office while Jim Buss, son of former Lakers owner Jerry Buss, joined the team in 1998.
The Lakers, who last week were ranked second in Forbes' list of most valuable NBA teams at $3 billion, are in the midst of one of the worst on-court stretches in their history.
Earlier this month the Lakers hired Johnson to advise ownership on basketball and business in a role the team said would include collaborating with coaches, mentoring players and assessing future franchise needs.
He called his newest role a "dream come true" and pledged to work tirelessly to get the team back to the top of the NBA.
"Since 1979, I've been a part of the Laker Nation and I'm passionate about this organization," said Johnson. "I will do everything I can to build a winning culture on and off the court."
Johnson, 57, who ended his 12-year career with the Lakers in 1991 after he was diagnosed with HIV, was a minority owner of the team for several years after his retirement and built a business that owns movie theaters, health clubs and other properties.
Johnson, who staged a brief NBA comeback in 1996, was the face of a group that bought Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers for $2 billion in 2012. That group also bought Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC and WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks.
Los Angeles have not made the postseason since losing in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs and, with a 19-39 record that has them sitting second-last in the Western Conference, are headed to a fourth consecutive losing campaign.

Smart hearables－you read it right. No typo there, by the way.
You may own or have heard of smart wearables, multipurpose gadgets in the form of wrist-bands, bracelets, necklaces, so on. They could soon become old hat as versatile hearables are in.
For example, a smart headphone can not only play music but "learn" about your preferences and program itself to play what you will enjoy. Beijing-based startup Vinci will ensure that.
"People are able to communicate with Vinci. You just need to say what you want, such as the name, singer, style of the music and your mood, and then the headphone will do as you ordered. We combine the hardware devices with software to create a new music experience," said David Zhu, Vinci's founder and CEO.
The startup is pioneering voice-controlled, eponymously branded headphones powered by artificial intelligence and featuring immersive 3-D sound. The startup is at the forefront of innovation in the hearable devices industry.
In December 2016, Vinci was crowd-funded on Kickstarter, the world's largest such platform for creative projects, obtaining $987,384.
Its achievements are brightening the record of China's headphone products in overseas markets.
Its headphones double up as personal assistants. A user can also check the weather, find local restaurants, schedule an appointment or dictate a text by just asking the headphone.
Vinci's headphones work independently of mobile phones, thus delivering on-the-go convenience.
That's not all. Like wearables, they can measure your heartbeat rate and track your physical activity like running, using built-in sensors and GPS technology.
Zhu said he got the inspiration for hearable technology from observing people's outdoor music listening habits.
"We found many people listen to music while walking outside, but they use several things such as earphone, smartphone, armband for the purpose. We wanted to create an easier way for them to listen to music," Zhu said, adding the all-in-one device makes for a good companion.
The screens on both sides of the headphone show the music that is being played, and users could stop or pause the music, or change the volume, by just swiping or tapping the screen.
Founded in 2014, the firm is making its presence felt in the mobile technology sector. It now has about 60 employees, with 80 percent of them driving research and development. Most of them graduated from top universities and have worked at big tech companies such as Baidu Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for five to 10 years.
Vinci the firm introduced 10,000 units of Vinci 1.0 headphones in 2015. Each smart hearable costs 1,799 yuan ($262). It plans to launch Vinci 1.5 later this month.
"The smart headphone market will witness an explosive growth this year, and many tech giants will tap into this field in the second half of 2017. With the rise of artificial intelligence and voice interaction, this field will definitely be hot," Zhu said.
Liu Ting, a clerk at an educational institution, said: "I want to have a try as I have never used this kind of device to listen to music before. I could talk with my headphone? That's very cool."
'Assistants' set for explosive growth
The electronics segment related to voice-operated smart or artificial intelligence-powered gadgets is seeing explosive growth, with personal assistant devices leading the way.
Amazon's Alexa, the voice service that powers Echo, provides capabilities or skills that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice.
Examples of these skills include the ability to play preferred music, answer general questions and set an alarm or timer.
Among AI-powered personal assistants, Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana are prominent names.
iFlytek Co, a leading Chinese firm engaged in speech- and voice-recognition technologies, has made much efforts to promote the application of intelligent voice technology in mobile phones, automobiles, home appliances, toys and a number of other fields.
It has garnered more than 70 percent of market share in the Chinese speech technology market, and taken the lead in the formation of the Chinese speech industry supply chain.
According to the statistics from Speech Industry Alliance of China (SIAC) the scale of the global intelligent voice industry will reach $10.5 billion by 2017, with a growth rate of 29.6 percent.
Technology consultancy Gartner Inc predicts that 30 percent of human interactions with technology will be through "conversations" with smart machines by 2018.
The voice-based AI technology is now widely used in the intelligent home field. Users can use voice to control lighting, thermostat, home appliances, garage shutter and even security systems.
Andrew Ng, Baidu Inc's chief scientist, said: "As speech recognition accuracy goes from 95 percent to 99 percent, all of us in the room will go from barely using it to using it all the time."
According to comScore, 50 percent of all searches will be voice searches by 2020.

More than 25 million tourists are expected in the Tibet autonomous region this year, its tourism authority announced on Wednesday.
The visitors are expected to generate more than 37 billion yuan ($5.38 billion) in revenue, according to the Tibet tourism development commission.
It is estimated that Tibet's tourism industry will lift 30,000 people out of poverty this year.
Last year, the region received more than 23 million domestic and overseas tourists, up 14.8 percent year-on-year. Total tourism revenue hit more than 33 billion yuan, an increase of 17.3 percent year-on-year.
BEIJING - Investment in China's venture capital-backed financial technology firms hit a record high in 2016, bucking the global downward trend, international accounting firm KPMG said Tuesday.
The total value of investment deals in VC-backed Chinese fintech companies soared 42.6 percent year on year to $6.7 billion last year, according to a report from KPMG.
Meanwhile, globally, investment deals in VC-backed fintech firms plunged 46.8 percent year on year to $25 billion.
The report attributed China's strong performance to three mega-deals in the first half of 2016 as the country's tech giants became active in the sector.
Larger fintech players in China are beginning to look globally to fuel their continued growth and are expected to engage in more international collaboration throughout 2017, said Arthur Wang, partner and head of China Banking with KPMG China.
Fintech refers to businesses founded on the purpose of applying technology to services in the financial system, such as mobile transactions.
As China upgrades its economy, moving from investment and exports to innovation, the government has been exploring ways to inspire creativity and promote technological improvement.
In the Asian fintech market, payments and wealth management dominated investment in 2016, the KPMG report said.
It predicted real-time payment options to drive significant fintech activity in Asia over the next few years as customers increasingly demand better options.
The foreign ministry said in a statement that it strongly protests against Japan for its unjust claims to Dokdo islets by dispatching a senior government official to the Takeshima Day ceremony.
The statement urged Japan to immediately stop such event and squarely face up to history, saying Dokdo is an inherent territory of South Korea historically and geographically under international laws.
South Korea has effectively taken control of the rugged islets, composed mainly of volcanic rocks, since 1954. The rocky outcroppings were incorporated into Japan during its 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula, but the control of the islets was restored by South Korea following its liberation from the colonial rule.
Japan's Shimane prefecture designated Feb. 22 as Takeshima Day in 2005, and has, since 2006, held an event to mark the day annually.
The Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, has sent a senior cabinet member to the ceremony since 2013. For this year's celebration, Shunsuke Mutai, parliamentary vice minister of the Cabinet Office, attended it as a government representative.
South Korea has seen such acts as Japan's reluctance to acknowledge Japan's wartime aggression and brutalities, while showing the Abe cabinet's ambition to become a militaristic power.
Seoul's foreign ministry summoned a minister at the Japanese embassy in Seoul to protest against Japan's dispatch of a senior official to the controversial ceremony.
The diplomatic friction came at a time of frayed ties between the two countries over the so-called "statue of a girl" that symbolizes comfort women victims, a euphemism for Korean women who were lured or forced into Japanese military brothels as sex slaves before and during World War II.
In protest against an agreement reached in December 2015 between Seoul and Tokyo over the comfort women victims, South Korean civic group activists put up a girl statue in front of the Japanese consulate in Busan, South Korea's southeastern port city.
It was the second statue, which is erected near Japan's diplomatic office, since the first one was placed in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul in December 2011.
In retaliation, Japan recalled its ambassador to South Korea who has yet to return to Seoul.

Ant Financial Services Group, the parent company of online payment giant Alipay, is accelerating its global expansion by reaching into the South Korean market.
Ant Financial will invest $200 million in Kakao Pay, South Korean internet service provider Kakao Corp's mobile pay platform, according to an announcement by the two companies on Tuesday.
Kakao Pay will connect to the 34,000 stores currently using Alipay in South Korea, the statement said. There are more than 14 million customers using Kakao Pay.
Ant Financial said the investment was one part of a larger scale strategic partnership, which aimed at connecting the 450 million global users of Ant Financial with Kakao Pay.
Douglas Feagin, senior vice-president of Ant Financial, said: "South Korea is an important market for Ant Financial in its global expansion, and we see many opportunities in the market for innovative services and growth in mobile payments."
South Korea's Kakao has an extensive business portfolio ranging from communications to media, games, financial technology and online searching. Its instant messenger tool Kakao Talk is installed on at least 97 percent of South Korean smartphones.
Prior to Ant Financial, Tencent Holdings Ltd invested 403 million yuan ($58 million) in Kakao Corp in 2012, for a 13.84 percent stake in the latter.
Ant Financial has been quite aggressive exploring the global mobile payment market in recent years－in line with the target that the company's Chief Executive Officer Jing Xiandong set in October last year, to have 2 billion customers worldwide in the next 10 years.
On Feb 17, Ant Financial announced it would invest in digital financial company Mynt in the Philippines.
Geng said that China expects the upcoming visit to improve bilateral ties, as the two sides working to build a new partnership.
Hailing the sound development of bilateral ties, Geng said that the two sides had witnessed close high-level exchanges, and cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment protection, innovation, and the Arctic research had all progressed.
China expressed deep condolences to the family of late Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, Russian government and Russia's mission to the UN over his death, a senior Chinese envoy said at a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday in New York.
We feel shocked and sad about Ambassador Churkin's sudden death and express deep condolence, said Liu Jieyi, China's ambassador to the UN.
Liu described Churkin as a capable, experienced and senior diplomat who has made important contributions to the UN and multilateralism.
"He worked till the end of his life, showing exactly what's dedication and professionalism. He is an outstanding representative of diplomats," Liu said.
The UN Security Council paid tribute to the veteran diplomat before a meeting and ambassadors of 15 council members made speeches in memory of him.
Churkin, who has been Russia's permanent representative to the UN since 2006, died in New York on Monday, one day before his 65th birthday, after becoming ill at work, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. He died reportedly from a heart attack.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that he "learned with shock and sadness" of the death of Churkin.
"Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests," Guterres said in a statement issued on Monday.
Churkin, who was born on Feb 21, 1952, in Moscow, served as ambassador-at-large at the Russian Foreign Ministry from 2003 to 2006, before his appointment to the UN. He was Russian ambassador to Canada from 1998 to 2003, and to Belgium from 1994 to 1998.

Samsonite International SA, the world's largest branded-luggage maker by market share, is pinning its hopes on e-commerce and social media to fuel growth and make China its biggest market within five years.
"Now that 20 percent of our Chinese businesses come from online, we expect the number to grow by about a third in a couple of years," he said.
Global net sales in 2015 reached $2.43 billion.
Virtual stores on Tmall and JD, the country's duopoly of business-to-customer sites, have claimed 60 percent of Samsonite's online business in China. They also sell through the digital outlets of shopping malls and department stores.
To harness that growth, Samsonite will open its indigenous direct online shopping portal this year to attract more sophisticated buyers who wish to purchase bigger-ticket items via the brand, rather than a third party.
There are good reasons for Samsonite to accelerate its digital deployment. According to its interim report, first-half sales in 2016 remained flat partly due to a sluggish performance in China, as consumers migrate online and dragged down sales TV home shopping and department store channels.
It also spares no effort in utilizing social media campaigns to guide traffic to bricks-and-mortar stores, according to Frank Ma, Samsonite's president for China and the Philippines.
For example, followers of Samsonite's official WeChat account can sign up for a promotional event in a shopping center and get a discount coupon. Ma said content marketing helps attracts customers and adds to another 5 percent to its offline sales.
Seven of Samsonite's nine brands have been introduced to China, ranging from the entry-level American Tourister to the newly acquired Tumi, which targets high-end business travelers.
Tainwala said he is heartened by new initiatives to merge online and offline retail, such as the partnership between Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Bailian Group.
BERLIN - Germany on Tuesday announced a plan to expand its national army Bundeswehr in light of "increasing responsibilities."
The number of professional soldiers will increase by around 10 percent from 178,000 to 198,000 by the year 2024, defense minister Ursula von der Leyen said, adding that non-combat civilian employees would also expand to over 61,000 to fend off growing cyber attacks or hacking.
"The Bundeswehr is under demand like never before. The Bundeswehr must be allowed to grow accordingly," said von der Leyen.
German soldiers are currently engaged in operations in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State, in Mali supporting United Nations' stabilization mission, and also in the Baltic States as part of NATO's defense force.
The increase in manpower was also widely seen as a response to Washington's recent pressure on NATO members.
The newly-elected US President Donald Trump had called the military alliance "obsolete" and threatened to "moderate" the United States' commitment to it if NATO partners failed to meet the mandated defense spending target of 2.0 percent of gross domestic product. It has raised fears that the United States would no longer be the guardian of European security, and Berlin could have to fill the void.
Jose claims his former club more concerned with tie than United
Jose Mourinho said Manchester United's FA Cup quarterfinal against Chelsea will preoccupy the Blues more because they are in fewer competitions than his Red Devils.
United battled into the last eight with a 2-1 fifth-round victory at second-tier struggler Blackburn Rovers on Sunday.
Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic came off the bench to combine for the latter to net a second-half winner at Ewood Park, maintaining United's interest in four competitions.
Premier League leader Chelsea is chasing the domestic league and FA Cup double, but, with no European involvement for the Londoners, Mourinho was quick to revert to his favored mind games when asked about drawing his former club.
"I have no reaction," said the United manager.
"I have to play Saint-Etienne (in the Europa League), I have to play the final, I have to play, hopefully, another game in the Europa League, I have to fight for a top-four position in the Premier League.
"So I have so many things to think about. Probably Chelsea can only think about that because they are champions (elect).
"They have nothing else to play for. The FA Cup is something I believe is important for them."
United has not won at Stamford Bridge since 2012, and most recently in west London slumped to a 4-0 October loss, Mourinho's worst Premier League result.
This week United travels to France with a 3-0 lead for the second leg of its Europa League last-32 tie against Saint-Etienne and then plays Southampton in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday.
United's scheduling problems might have been worse had it faced an FA Cup replay against Blackburn.
After Danny Graham's Rovers opener was canceled out by England striker Marcus Rashford, that appeared a likely outcome.
But Pogba and Ibrahimovic combined for a goal that underlined their growing understanding as the latter took his season tally to 24 goals in all competitions.
'Right attitude'
"People learn how to play together, that's normal," said Mourinho.
"They've played together for seven or eight months, so I think the connection between quality players is helped by time.
"The number of goals Zlatan would score, I didn't know. I knew he would be a very important player for us.
"I didn't know whether it would be one more or one less goal, but I knew what his contribution would be."
In contrast to his criticism following Thursday's triumph over Saint-Etienne, Mourinho was complimentary of all his players, and was relieved they avoided the same fate that befell top-flight Burnley and Leicester against lower-league opposition on Saturday.
"Today they were ready," said the Portuguese.
"I think they felt it was a really difficult match and I think what happened yesterday, with every Premier League team in difficult situations, was one more alert.
"So the players knew it would be difficult and came out with the right attitude. I'm pleased with that."
Mourinho will travel to Saint-Etienne without Wayne Rooney and Phil Jones, who missed the Blackburn game with injuries and are doubtful for Sunday's League Cup final.
Blackburn boss Owen Coyle must now focus on the 1995 Premier League champion's relegation battle.
"We showed today that we are not a coat of paint away from being a very good team," he said.




One need only glance at the acrimonious speculation launched at Gus Poyet in the immediate aftermath of Shanghai Shenhua's failure to reach the AFC group stages to understand how the Chinese Super League's (CSL) hyperbolic spending has recalibrated the expectations of Chinese footballing fandom and media.
Boasting rosters and a level of economic firepower unmatched throughout East Asia, Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao, Shanghai SIPG, and Jiangsu Suning enter this year's competition as the spunky, arrogantly coiffed representatives of the CSL. Pressure and international attention has never been higher.
Rest assured, there'll be little sympathy should they unravel like poorly parceled dumplings and anything other than reaching the knockout rounds will be scolded as an inexcusable failure. Asia's premier club competition kicks off on Feb 21 with the final group games set to be played on May 9 and 10.
Shanghai SIPG (Group F)
New manager André Villas-Boas made the bold, and conceivably regrettable, preseason claim that the club president will sleep with at least one trophy in his bed by the season's end. The side performed with fluidity in their 3-0 dismantling of Thailand's Sukhothai, but will encounter sterner resistance against FC Seoul, Urawa Red Diamonds, and Western Sydney Wanderers.
The likes of Oscar, Wu Lei, and Carvalho will look to guide the relatively inexperienced side through its first AFC outing side. Additionally, though the capture of Odil Ahmedov passed without the fervor of Oscar, the Uzbek's fine range of passing will likely prove invaluable against stubborn opposition.
Shanghai travel to FC Seoul in their first game and given the Korean side's dominant 2016, winning the K-League and losing the AFC semifinal to eventual champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, the contest could potentially set the tone and capabilities of Villas-Boas' side in continental football. Urawa Red Diamonds boast experience and attacking firepower at this level, though their defensive frailty will likely be targeted.
Managed by former Crystal Palace stalwart Tony Popovic, the Australian side is in the midst of the 2016-17 A-League season and is yet to find the consistency of the previous campaign. The grueling trip to southeastern Australia is scheduled as Shanghai's last group game, a real blessing provided Hulk and company have already guaranteed progress.
Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao (Group G)
China's beastly tour de force requires little introduction. With the CSL trophy seemingly super glued in the cabinet, Guangzhou views the AFC Champions League as the stage to claim footballing legitimacy and develop its global brand. Victory is the pathway to a FIFA Club World Cup spot and the glorious opportunity of facing Europe's finest.
Despite lifting the trophy in 2013 and 2015, last year's bumbling performance nearly cost Luiz Felipe Scolari his job. The club chairman, Xu Jiayin, calling for a clean sweep of competitions should be interpreted as expectation rather than aspiration. The publically stated squad bonus of 3 million yuan ($436,000) per victory is a garish manner of spelling out the bleatingly obvious.
The fixture selector has dealt a kind hand to Guangzhou and the stage seems set for Jackson Martínez to establish some early season form. While Hong Kong debutants Eastern is something of an unknown quantity, Chan Yuenting's side is certainly preferable to a potential trip Down Under. Likewise, Guangzhou might feel Kawasaki Frontale is the pick of the qualified Japanese teams, especially having lost the highly influential forward Yoshito Okubo in the offseason.
Suwon Samsung Bluewings enjoyed a lukewarm 2016 and only qualified for the competition through a win in their domestic cup. However,having been eliminated in 2016 through the impenetrable complexities of the tiebreaker rule system, the Korean outfit might be playing for retribution. Although Guangzhou's 2016 exploits proved there are no guarantees on this stage, they certainly couldn't have wished for a kinder group.
Jiangsu Suning (Group H)
While the CSL transfer window witnessed a dizzying flurry of activity, the Nanjing-based side has spent the offseason introvertly honing its capable squad under the focus of manager Choi Yong-soo. Jiangsu's consistency in 2016 surprised many, but throwing away a knockout place in the last 20 minutes of group action against Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors reeked of immaturity.
The pace and movement of the South American trio Ramires, Alex Teixeira, and Roger Martínez is sure to unsettle any defense like a strong whiff of stinky tofu- though Trent Sainsbury's collected defensive performances will surely be missed following his loan to Inter Milan.
Choi Yong-soo has cited Jeju United F.C. as the toughest side in the group, however he may be playing mind games given the Korean side's six year absence from AFC action and a goal scoring threat that is somewhat reliant on newbie Frederic Mendy.
Adelaide United returned to the AFC for the first time since 2012 last season and made an impressive surge to the quarterfinals. Marshaled by legendary goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic, the AFC will hopefully prove a welcome distraction from a disastrous A-League campaign that finds the club bottom of the league. Gamba Osaka are arguably the veterans of the group having competed in five of the past seven competitions, led by the ageless midfielder Endo Yasuhito the Japanese side will undoubtedly offer intelligent and organized resistance.

After being held in China for eight years, the Advantage Austria Ski Race for the first time was won by a Chinese racer on Saturday at Zhangjiakou's Genting Secret Garden Resort, Hebei province, with Liu Ji crossing the finish line in 51.75 seconds, ahead of an Austrian racer.
The race, which is regarded as a networking platform for the Austrian-Chinese winter sports community, attracted 110 racers from China and all over the world.
"Actually, now we have more Chinese participants than Austrians, which is fantastic," said Martin Glatz, head of Advantage Austria Beijing and commercial counselor at the Austrian embassy. He said it reflected the growth of winter sports in China.
Since Beijing and its neighboring city, Zhangjiakou, won the right in 2015 to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, China has been promoting its national campaign to encourage 300 million people to participate in winter sports.
In November, the General Administration of Sport of China released plans to construct winter sports infrastructure and popularize winter sports, calling for at least 650 skating rinks and 800 ski resorts to be built across the country by 2022 and the winter sports industry to be valued at 1 trillion yuan ($144.5 billion) by 2025.
Zhan Weiping, vice chairman of the Austria-China Friendship Association, told China Daily website that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics could bring more business opportunities to Austrian companies.
Austria, having a long tradition of winter sports, was one of the first countries to develop ski resorts, technologies related to winter sports and a winter sports industry. Zhan said more Austrian winter sports companies are now very interested in China's market.
"Some of them have already entrusted me to bring their projects to China. They are looking forward to working with Chinese investors and distributors and considering establishing factories in China," Zhan said.
He believes Austria and China can take advantage of each other's strengths as Austrian companies can bring technology, brands and management models and their Chinese partners can offer capital, place and local support.
For those Austrian companies already in China's market, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics can also be regarded as a boost.
Austrian company AST, a supplier of ice skating rinks, has been operating for 12 years in the Chinese market. Zhong Shuai, general manager of AST China, said the company was involved in the building and operation of more than 50 percent of the ice skating rinks in China by 2015.
"The winter sports industry needs long-term investment. And the return of investment is related to the market scale," he said the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics could boost a healthy development of winter sports industry in China.
More information on China's winter sports market and Austrian winter sports companies' development in China can be found in China Daily website's interview with Martin Glatz. The following are edited excerpts of the interview:

Team Techeetah's podium finish in its inaugural FIA Formula E Championship has boosted the Chinese entry's commitment to excellence in the all-electric motor-racing series.
Techeetah, which was founded prior to the 2016-17 campaign by Chinese sports-marketing company SECA, overcame some early-season setbacks as veteran driver Jean-Eric Vergne finished runner-up to defending series champion Sebastien Buemi of Renault e.dams in Saturday's Buenos Aires ePrix.
Lucas di Grassi of ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport finished third after battling through some mechanical issues that slowed him down from the pole position midway through the race.
As the new entry's first podium finish in the 10-team competition, Vergne's impressive run has fired up Techeetah, which was plagued by accidents and technical issues during the first two races of the 12-leg season, in Hong Kong and Marrakesh.
"We had a very stressful start in the first two races, but the result here gives us a timely push to keep working hard," Ivan Yim, managing director of Techeetah, told China Daily during a post-race celebration in the pit.
After acquiring the former Team Aguri last July, SECA announced plans to build Techeetah around Vergne and homegrown driver Ma Qinghua for the third season of the championship.
Techeetah signed former Williams and Jaguar Formula One team manager David Stubbs in November to oversee operational matters.
"We had only 90 days to get the cars and the team ready for the season," said Yim.
"The break between Marrakesh and this race gave us a chance to catch up. We did a lot of things within the team itself, upgrading a lot of our equipment and bringing in new people, including mechanics."
Formula E has struck a chord with a growing number of electric vehicle manufacturers, from small startups to big-name brands such as Audi and Jaguar, which see the championship as a testing ground for the latest technology in powertrain and battery developments.
Electric-motor specialists such as Chinese company NextEV Nio and China-funded Faraday Future in the US have also climbed onboard.
Yim said Ma's emergence as the only Chinese driver on the grid helps Techeetah stand out as a legitimate force in the championship.
"He is building gradually. His experience and strength were in the World Touring Car Championship, which is different. We keep working with him, we brought a driver coach along," Yim said of Ma, who won multiple titles in the WTCC.
The 29-year-old Ma, who practiced at his home race in Shanghai in 2013 after becoming China's first driver to hold a Formula One super license, is cautiously optimistic about the rest of the season.
"We are a new team that needs enough trace minutes and miles to adjust our technology for more consistent performances," said Ma. "I feel much more confident this year with a new engineer."

LONDON - French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron told British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday not to expect any favours from the European Union during Brexit talks, and drew big cheers for his pro-EU message from French nationals in London.
Macron visited May at her Downing Street office and later met Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond, a public relations coup for the young ex-banker at a time when his campaign appears to be losing momentum.
"Brexit cannot lead to a kind of optimisation of Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe. An exit is an exit," he told reporters outside 10 Downing Street after meeting May.
"I am very determined that there will be no undue advantages."
Macron, 39, a former economy minister in Socialist President Francois Hollande's government, is running as an independent. He is due to unveil his detailed programme next week.
The latest polls suggest he and right-wing rival Francois Fillon are tied behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead of the first round of the election on April 23. Polls suggest either man would easily beat Le Pen in the May 7 run-off.
Macron, who did not obtain a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a recent visit to Berlin, was keen to improve his standing on the world stage and court voters in London, which has an estimated 200,000 French residents.

SAPPORO, Japan - China dominated in the 500m short track speed skating at the Asian Winter Games here on Tuesday, while host Japan topped the medal tally by sweeping four speed skating golds.
China claimed the two gold medals up for grabs in short track speed skating for the day.
Zang Yize, 17, winner of the Youth Winter Olympic Games in 2016, clocked in 43.911 seconds to take the title in a dramatic race with China's world champion Fan Kexin and Shim Suk Hee of South Korea both disqualified after getting tangled up in the final lap.
"I think she (Fan) was too eager to win the race, and anything could happen in the short track speed race," said Zang, who just won the gold at the Winter Universiade earlier this month in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
"I am happy to win the gold as this is the fist time I competed in the Asian Winter Games. I will train much harder after the Asiad," added Zang, who already sets her eyes on the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
Ito Ayuko of Japan snatched the silver in 44.236, while the bronze went to the Final B winner Choi Minjeong of South Korea in 44.819 as there is no third place finisher in the Final A.
Wu Dajing, a silver medalist in Sochi 2014, timed 40.764 to take the men's title, beating Seo Yira of South Korea to second place in 40.842.
Another South Korean Park Seyeong, who just won the 1,500m race on Monday, was third in 41.182.
Japan collected five gold medals on the day, four from speed skating.
Star skater Nao Kodaira added a 500m gold to her 1,000m win, clocking 37.39 seconds, beating two-time Olympic champion Lee Sang-Hwa from South Korea to second place by 0.31 seconds. Japanese Go Arisa was third in 37.73.
Miho Takagi also won her second gold at the Asiad by taking the women's 1,500m.
Takagi, who already had the 3,000m gold and 1,000m silver to her belt, triumphed in 1:56.07, while her teammate Misaki Oshigiri came second in 1:58.13. Nana Takagi finished third in 1:59.45 with her fellow Japanese Ayano Sato fourth in 1:59.77.
China's first ever Olympic speed skating champion Zhang Hong, who clocked 2:00.14, took a lucky bronze as the Olympic Council of Asia doesn't allow a clean sweep of the podium by the same delegation.
"This was the event where we had the biggest chance of sweeping the top four spots, and being able to do that was very significant for us as a Japan national team," said Nana Takagi.
Takuro Oda won the men's 1,000m in 1:09.33 before the Japanese dominated the women's team pursuit in 3:00.08, beating South Korea by 6.67 seconds into second place.
China got the bronze in 3:10.23, 7.29 seconds ahead of the only other participating team - Kazakhstan.
The host also won a gold in the women's 10km cross-country free through Yuki Kobayashi, who finished in 30:24.6, 24.4 seconds faster than 35-year-old defending champion Lee Chae-won from South Korea.
The bronze went to Yelena Kolomina of Kazakhstan. China's veteran Li Hongxue only placed sixth.
Kazakhstan also pocketed a gold in cross-country skiing as Rinat Mukhin, 23, claimed the men's 15km free title in 41:25.3.
Japan's Naoto Baba, only 4.5 seconds slower, settled for the silver, while another Japanese Akira Lenting took the bronze in 41:33.3. China was seventh.
China did a good job in curling in the day, as its men's team defeated South Korea 8-3, and the women's team beat Japan 8-5.
Also on Tuesday, the ski jumping men normal hill individual events were rescheduled for Wednesday due to inclement weather.

China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, the country's largest missile maker, will step up global expansion this year, as it aims to quintuple the number of foreign enterprises registered on its industrial internet platform.
Wei Yiyin, deputy general manager of CASIC, said less than 2,000 foreign companies have registered on its online industrial internet platform－casicloud.com.
"We aim to increase the number to 10,000 by the end of this year as our company ramps up efforts to promote our services to Pakistan, Europe and Southeast Asia," Wei said.
The industrial internet refers to combining advanced machines with internet-connected sensors and big-data analytics. It is designed to boost the productivity, efficiency, and reliability of industrial production.
CASIC's casicloud industrial internet platform went into operation in June, 2015. Via the platform, CASIC offers enterprises cloud-based technology and products that can help upgrade plant.
According to CASIC's Wei, the company has partnered with Germany's Siemens AG to work on smart manufacturing.
The move came as China is ramping up efforts to upgrade its manufacturing industry with the big data and internet technology.
"We are working on a national guideline to promote the development of the industrial internet," Minister of Industry and Information Technology Miao Wei said on Tuesday.
The industrial internet is highlighted in the country's Made in China 2025 strategy, which was designed to promote high-end manufacturing.
"We have done a relatively good job in applying the internet to industrial production. This year we will see big opportunities in the high-tech manufacturing sector," the minister added.
The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics can be an extreme accelerator to bring people to the snow, said Peter Schott, general manager of International Trade, HEAD International GmbH (HEAD), a leading global manufacturer and marketer of premium sports equipment and apparel.
In November, the General Administration of Sport of China released plans on constructing winter sports infrastructure and popularizing winter sports, calling for at least 650 skating rinks and 800 ski resorts to be built across the country by 2022. About 300 million people are expected to participate in winter sports and the winter sports industry is projected to be worth one-trillion-yuan ($144.5 billion) by 2025.
While it sees no exciting growth in the well-established winter sports market in Europe, the Austrian company said it is realistic to expect that China will catch up and become the biggest ski market in the world.
In addition, the company has witnessed China's winter sports market becoming more competitive as everyone, small or big companies, is trying to tap the potential.
To tap the market, Head has partnered with Nanjing B.C. Sports Products Co Ltd (B.C. Sports) in distribution and supported actions with the aim to popularize winter sports, Schott said.
Peter Schott spoke to China Daily website about China's winter sports market and the Austrian company's business strategy and its plans in China at the 8th Advantage Austria Ski Race held in Zhangjiakou's Genting Resort Secret Garden, Hebei province, on Saturday.
The following are edited excerpts of the interview:
What's your assessment of China's winter sports market?
Currently, China is the most challenging market in the world. We have already seen a lot of progress and we hope the market will still expand a lot. The markets in Austria, France and Italy are not growing anymore and the potential there is steady, so we do not see growth there. We expect that China will catch up and become the biggest ski market in the world, which is a realistic expectation.
How do you align your business strategy with the Chinese market? What's unique about HEAD's competitiveness?
The first step for us was to find a distribution partner, which we did with B.C. Sports, a company that is already very active in the snow sports industry. The next step was to convince people in China that quality is the main issue to make the sports attractive. In terms of extra competitive advantages or extra features that HEAD can provide, we launched at Genting Resort Secret Garden last year our rental system, which enables the rental provider to bring the products very fast to the consumer. So it is no longer necessary to stand in line for one or two hour until you get your product. So we set an example there. We will try to spread this all over China and also provide products that help people to learn ski very quickly, because this is important as well.
How do you think the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will influence China's winter sports industry? What do you think of China's latest plan for developing winter sports?
This is extreme accelerator to bring people to the snow. Of course we are all curious up to what level this will come. A lot needs to be done in terms of investment to provide key facilities. And as far as I know, a lot is in progress and a lot is going to be invested. And of course we know that we should also think about how to bring people to snow sports, how to teach them quickly. And it is important that they remain with skiing.
Is the Chinese market becoming more competitive?
It is becoming more competitive, of course, because everybody is trying to make business here. And all the brands are already here, smaller or bigger.
What is HEAD's future plan in China?
The future plan is to support any action that is targeted at growing the winter sports. So we have already supported ski education, we have already provided the best products and we have already supported the Chinese ski foundation.
Will HEAD establish a factory in China?
We held intensive discussion last year and we really thought intensively about setting up a factory here but it is still too early. However, we still have that in mind. Maybe not establishing a major factory, but assembling ski boards as the inner parts of the ski boards are already made in China. So maybe bring the plastic parts to china and assemble them here or do some binding production here. This could be an option. It is too early to give a definite answer but we have that in mind. It is very possible in the future.
What opportunities and positive effects do you think the Belt and Road Initiative could bring to Austrian companies?
It depends on the companies. The market is here, we have a lot of knowhow that is not presented in China yet. So it really depends on the companies: how active they are and what partners they have in the market.
A farmer who hunted 114 toads, killing 109 of them, has been arrested in Chun'an county in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, according to a report by Hangzhou Daily Online.
The 48-year-old farmer, surnamed Chen, said he intended to use the toads in dishes for a dinner party and caught them in a reservoir on Feb 14, according to China News Agency.
On Feb 18, the Chun'an Forest Police caught Chen and his friends killing toads by a stream, having been tipped off by local residents. A total of 109 dead toads were found, with police setting free the five that were still alive.
"I didn't know that catching toads is an illegal act. I will never hunt toads or sparrows again," Chen told the police after he was arrested.
While many people know about regulations regarding the protection of rare and endangered animals, hunters are often unaware of the list of wildlife that is beneficial to the State or has important economic and scientific research value.
Up to 1,700 species with a significant value in ecology, science and society, including sparrows, toads, frogs, wall lizards, hares, pheasants and snakes, have been added to the list by the State Forestry Administration.
It is illegal to hunt animals on the list without permission. Hunting more than 20 constitutes a crime, and more than 50 is regarded as a severe crime, according to the criminal law.
"We see about 50 similar cases each year and the species varies with seasons," Lu Qiangjun, director of Chun'an Forest Police Bureau, was quoted as saying by Zhejiang News Online.
In another case on Monday in Liuyang, Hunan province, a villager was arrested on charges of capturing 4,057 toads weighing a total of 384 kilograms in the past two weeks, Changsha Evening News reported.
"It is time for us to take more measures to spread knowledge about wildlife," Lu said.
The list of animals can be found in booklets that illustrate some typical cases, Lu said.

Commercial bank earnings increase by 3.54 percent year-on-year, says CBRC
The net profit growth in 2016 of Chinese commercial banks increased 1.11 percentage points year-on-year as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, while the nonperforming loan ratio dropped slightly after a continuous rise since the first quarter of 2012, according to data released by the national banking regulator on Wednesday.
Commercial banks posted net profit totaling 1.65 trillion yuan ($240 billion) by the end of the fourth quarter, up 3.54 percent from a year earlier.
The quality of credit assets remained stable in general, said the China Banking Regulatory Commission. The NPL ratio of commercial banks fell two basis points from the end of the previous quarter to 1.74 percent, although the lenders' balance of nonperforming loans increased slightly by 1.2 percent to 1.51 trillion yuan.
During the same period, the balance of special-mention loans, potentially weak loans presenting an unwarranted credit risk, dropped from 3.5 trillion yuan to 3.4 trillion yuan.
The CBRC said commercial banks have a strong ability to offset the risk. As of the end of the fourth quarter, the ratio of allowance for loan impairment losses to nonperforming loans rose by 88 basis points from the end of the previous quarter to 176.4 percent.
As of Wednesday, 11 commercial banks listed in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, including seven banks listed last year, released their preliminary earnings for 2016.
All these banks, except Jiangyin Rural Commercial Bank Co Ltd in Jiangsu province, posted net profit growth ranging from 1.14 percent to 19.35 percent.
Among them, four city commercial banks recorded double-digit growth, with Bank of Ningbo Co Ltd in Zhejiang province heading the list.
Wu Qing, a banking research fellow with the Development Research Center of the State Council, said: "It's quite normal for city commercial banks, especially newly listed ones, to enjoy faster growth than their peers. However, double-digit profit growth does not represent the current situation of the Chinese banking sector in general. I expect that net profit growth in the banking sector will remain slow for a while, at a rate slightly above zero."
Zeng Gang, director of banking research at the Institute of Finance and Banking in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, agreed that profit growth will keep slowing, which is the overall trend in the banking sector.
Despite economic and regulatory challenges, Zeng noted that several positive factors that benefit commercial banks have already emerged.
"Corporate demand for loans is recovering. This will greatly improve the credit risk environment for banks. Moreover, banks have almost completely digested the impact of China's interest rate liberalization, so their net interest margins will probably rebound," he said.

Long seen as an anti-ageing treatment for women, more and more men are giving Botox – err, Brotox – a shot. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Enter Botox, a lethal neurotoxin (technically "botulinum toxin type A") that relaxes muscles via injection and was discovered to help reduce wrinkles by a California plastic surgeon in 1989. After a long period of formal trials, it was approved for use in the US in 2002 – and has since become a household name as the world's most common cosmetic procedure.
Long used by women, in the early Botox days, there were few male clients; most did it for occupational reasons, such as actors and anchormen. Through wider acceptance in society, it has become more common for men in recent years. Some clinics in Hong Kong even claim that male clients compose 50% of their business today. The rise in popularity explains how the humorous nickname "Brotox" has entered the vernacular.
Where do guys get their Brotox injected? They say the eyes are the key to the soul – and so the most popular areas address crow's feet and the vertical lines between the eyebrows. These lines can make a man look angry and unapproachable, which is why nine-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz, an open endorser of Botox, wanted to try it in the first place. In an interview with plastic surgery website Make Me Heal, Spitz explained, "I wasn't trying to look younger or different; I just wanted my face to portray how good I was feeling inside – instead of telling the world that I was perplexed or angry all the time."
Concerned about "surprise lines" on your forehead? Those annoying, intractable lines can also make you look older than you actually are, so a considerable amount of Botox treatments are focused on this area. However, it's hard to completely remove them because this is an easy-to-crease area.
Botox has been nicknamed the "lunchtime facelift" because it can be done in less than 15 minutes. Expect to see effects after two weeks of injection, with the best results after about a month. In Hong Kong, the standard practice is to have a consultation session with your doctor before deciding what areas to address and how many shots are needed. Fees are charged per area or per unit, depending on the clinic; locally, some start at HK$3,000 per treatment package of 10 units. You don't need to drastically change your routine or eating habits. Just avoid alcohol on the first day of injection and don't apply pressure to the area. So, what are your plans for lunch?
 
Bidders from the Chinese mainland with deep pockets are becoming more prominent at auctions of Asian art, and experts say there is no sign of the trend easing.


British auction house Bonhams said the emergence of buyers from the Chinese mainland, who are trading and buying in the West, was one of the most important developments in the art world in the last decade.
Colin Sheaf, head of Asian art at Bonhams, said: "These Chinese mainland collectors are passionate about classical Chinese art and they now have the opportunity to buy and also perhaps really understand quality pieces."
Sheaf said Chinese collectors are "astonishingly enthusiastic about (China's) history" and fascinated by its culture. One major trend Bonhams noted was the growing interest in Chinese furniture.
Asaph Hyman, international head of Chinese ceramics and works of art, said: "There is a real appreciation for this particular category in China, but it is also drawing attention from collectors in the West too."
In Bonhams' upcoming Fine Chinese Art auction in London on May 11, highlights will include a collection of Chinese furniture dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.
The auction house said the value of Chinese furniture had gone up 10-fold during the last 15 years and noted that the majority of buyers from the Chinese mainland were willing to pay even more.
Hyman said the simple lines and almost architectural and geometric designs were an attraction for collectors.
"The pieces may look simple, but there is an immensely sophisticated design," he explained. "The craftsmen don't use any nails to put the furniture together and this makes the piece look elegant and appealing."
A lacquer and bamboo two-part center table from the time of the Qing Dynasty emperors Yongzheng and Qianlong, who reigned between the years 1723 and 1796, is expected to attract a lot of attention at the auction. The table is modeled to resemble two adjoining leaves and was likely to have been manufactured during the reign of the Yongzheng emperor.
However, Bonhams said that demand from the palace for such lacquered furniture continued into the Qianlong period. The piece is likely to go for between 80,000 pounds ($103,000) and 120,000 pounds.
Also going under the hammer is a rare imperial famille rose twelve-leaf screen from the time of Emperor Jiaqing, who reigned from 1796 to 1820. Each porcelain panel is enameled with depictions of groups of immortals. It is expected to fetch between 100,000 pounds and 150,000 pounds.
Hyman said he believes the screen was specially commissioned for a celebration, such as a birthday, possibly by or for the emperor.
In addition, a diverse collection of Tibetan Buddhist paintings on cloth and silk will be auctioned next week.




 
Customers buy traditional buns made for the annual Cheung Chau bun festival in Hong Kong on Wednesday. [Photo/Agence France - Presse]
HONG KONG - Tens of thousands gathered in Hong Kong on Wednesday for one of its most colorful festivals, a whirlwind of music and costume culminating in a dramatic climb up a precipitous "bun tower".
Pipers, drummers and lion dancers accompanied by a cacophony of cymbals filled the streets of the normally sleepy island of Cheung Chau, as part of the annual "bun festival" parade.
Young children in intricate outfits - posing as deities, local sporting heroes and even politicians - gave the impression of floating above the crowds as they were wheeled around on high pedestals.
Along the parade route shoppers bought bags of the sweet buns at the heart of the celebrations.
A late-night scramble by agile competitors up an 18-meter tower made from imitation buns topped off the festivities.
The whole event harks back to the 19th century, when Cheung Chau was struggling to combat a plague and pirate raids.
The story goes that local fishermen paraded a statue of Taoist sea deity Pak Tai as part of a carnival to drive away the plague and evil spirits.
It worked - and Pak Tai has been a spiritual hero ever since.
The festivities today revolve around Cheung Chau's Pak Tai temple and attract visitors from all over Hong Kong and abroad.
Kwok Yu-chuen runs one of the bakeries that pumps out the famous festival buns and has been working there for 40 years.
Made from rice flour and filled with sweet pastes including lotus seed, red bean and sesame, they are embossed with Chinese characters meaning "peace" and "safe" and symbolize health and prosperity.
"Many people hope for peace, safety and good health by eating the buns from Cheung Chau," says Kwok, 53.
"That's why they like to come here to join the celebrations."
Real buns are no longer used to create the bun tower.
Instead, plastic buns line a steel frame as part of safety measures brought in after an old-style structure - made from bamboo and real buns - collapsed in 1978 and caused injuries.
But competitors each year still scale heady heights, stuffing buns into sacks they are carrying as they climb.
Buns from the top of the tower carry the most points and the highest scorer is the winner.
This year local firefighter Jason Kwok and climbing instructor Angel Wong - both repeat winners - again took the men's and women's titles.

Firm promotes local brands

Design firm VBS held a fashion show in Beijing recently, showcasing local designer brands including Lord's Collar and Miss Mission. Lord's Collar combines classic suits with collars inspired by Chinese elements, while Miss Mission has a collection that pays tribute to the free spirit of women. The show was held in collaboration with Fashion Next, a project initiated by public relations firm Weber Shandwick to promote local designers.
Directed by Sonthar Gyal from Qinghai province, the film focuses on the relationships between members of a small Tibetan family. The movie is told from the perspective of a little girl Yangchen Lhamo. She keeps on asking her parents questions and misunderstanding their answers. Losing her parent's love because of a newborn baby is the girl's deepest fear.
The film was selected for the Generation section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival in 2015 and won four nominations at the First National Film Festival.
Gyal wanted to let the world know the real life of Tibetan people through films.
"Different people have different ways to express their emotions and feelings. Since film is a common language, I can use it to present a real Tibetan life. The outside world has given Tibetan people too many tags that are not totally true," Gyal said.
The film will be shown in 11 cities in Japan until June 9, including Osaka, Nagoya and Kobe.

An exhibition featuring photographer Xia Tiangong's photos will be held at the Shang 8 Art Gallery in Beijing from May 7 to 20. A preview for the show will last from May 7 to 8.
Xia's soft and poetic works bear a style of traditional Chinese ink painting. Traditional Chinese culture in fact strongly influenced his photos as well. Finely clipped and printed on Chinese paper, these photos echo Xia's hobby of antique collection.
Critic Rasko Radovic said Xia "extracts the very idea of the sceneries" with his magical camera. In his eyes, Xia made the sceneries look "more real than they are in reality".
"Xia's unusual art could be called a Chinese water-and-ink painted with a camera instead of a brush… I was amazed to find out in these photos taken from life, the same regular, geometrical shapes of the trees in the paintings of Lin Fengmian that one would be inclined to see, if not as imaginary, than as a bold stylization of living forms," Radovic said.

Fruits of the region find their way into the aromas of Israel wines. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Rich in ancient culture, the Mediterranean nation is eager to bring its award-winning wines to a Chinese market intrigued by the biblical land. Mike Peters reports.
Just three years ago, Elyashiv Drori was showing reporters and fellow scholars a small box of what looked like black pebbles. Those dark nuggets, uncovered in an archaeological dig near Jerusalem's Old City, were the remains of a kilo of grapes stored nearly 3,000 years ago.
Today, the Israeli professor has more to show for his quest to revive the country's ancient grape varieties. Thanks to DNA technology, he has matched such findings with wild grapes scavenged by his master's-degree students at Ariel University. Identified and replicated, the centuries-old grapes are generating new interest in a very old wine industry - and headlines like "What did King David drink?"
Israel has recently become a trendy tourist destination for Chinese, and the country's winemakers are eager to capitalize on that enthusiasm.
"Like China, Israel has a culture that goes back thousands of years," says Tal Gal-Cohen, a consultant and lecturer who has been appointed "wine ambassador" by Israel's foreign ministry. As China's growing market of new wine drinkers are faced with a bewildering array of bottles to choose from, the Israelis hope that wines with a good story behind them can stand out in the crowd.
Jayme Gordon, 51, from Massachusetts, US was ordered Wednesday in a federal court in Boston to pay more than $3 million in damages.
Gordon filed a copyright lawsuit in 2011 alleging that DreamWorks Animation had stolen the characters and story from him for the 2008 animated comedy. He proposed the company settle for $12 million.
DreamWorks confronted him with evidence showing Gordon had traced his drawings from a 1996 Disney coloring book.
In addition to fabricating and backdating drawings, he also deleted evidence from his computer and lied under oath.
The litigation has cost the studio $3 million in legal fees.

As air pollution continues to plague much of China, proactive diners look for ways to eat away the problem. It's not so easy, Mike Peters reports.
Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe - and to love mackerel.
That play on words from an old song hints of one way that people cope with the ongoing effects of air pollution: Changing what they eat. Especially in northern China with its troubling levels of PM2.5, many are ready to meet the problem halfway, by adjusting our intake of food and drink to offset the effects of bad air.
Does it work?
That can depend on your expectations: In the short term, no. Changing what you eat today because the AQI reading is 350 might improve your health if you sustain the consumption habit over time, but you're probably not going to be breathing easier by bedtime.
Traditional Chinese medicine, which some turn to as a cheap alternative to expensive air purifiers, is always about long-term health, not quick cures.
"Remember, the emphasis of Chinese dietary therapy is not high nutrition - it is first ease of digestion," says Dr Alex Tan, a longtime TCM practitioner in Beijing who now lives in the United States. "Using raw unprocessed grain for modern humans is like using two-stroke mix for your Ferrari. Performance is compromised," he writes on a recent Straight Bamboo blog. Nutrition is lost when grains are cooked for digestibility, he concedes, so balance is needed with fresh-cooked vegetables and small amounts of protein.

Bayaneruul, 55, is an award-winning actor and director. His performance was well received in the movie The Sorrow of Brook Steppe in 1996. He is especially popular for his anti-hero roles in costume, martial arts dramas such as Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils and Return of the Condor Heroes.
His directorial ventures Sichenghangru (2009) and Norjmaa (2014) won awards at home and abroad.
"We treat animals as family members," Bayaneruul says. "We will be mocked if we are not professional enough."
Bayaneruul will focus on the changes in the past four decades starting from the time of China's reform and opening-up in the late 1970s.

China Railway Corp said that it will introduce more food suppliers and offer passengers more meal options on high-speed trains, after recent media reports bashed the overpriced boxed lunches provided on bullet trains.
The operator of the country's high-speed railway system said in a statement released on Tuesday night that it will build a "fair and open" online platform accessible to qualified suppliers, with a view toward letting passengers order meals directly.
The suppliers do not need to be companies subordinate to the 18 local railway bureaus, according to the statement, which did not give a timetable.
A spokesman for the company who was approached by China Daily on Wednesday declined to share more details about its plan to make the catering service more market-oriented.
The measure was announced after recent media reports criticized lunches sold on bullet trains as being too expensive, often between 40 yuan ($5.80) and 65 yuan ($9.45).
The cheapest meal, at 15 yuan, is also available, but train attendants often try to sell meals priced above 40 yuan when they push their trolleys through carriages at dinner time.
"They usually try to sell the expensive ones first. They won't sell the cheap ones until the expensive ones are sold out. They never tell you they have 15-yuan meals until you ask," said Gu Xin, a public servant from Shenzhen who takes bullet trains several times a year.
The Xi'an-based Chinese Business View reported earlier this week that attendants' income is tied to the boxed lunches they sell to passengers, which is why they seldom recommend the cheaper ones.

Hirokazu Koreeda, who makes films that mainly focus on domestic relationships, was a big draw at the recent Beijing International Film Festival. Yang Yang reports.
Japanese film director Hirokazu Koreeda was recently in the Chinese capital for the Beijing International Film Festival, at which eight of his films were shown.
Hirokazu, who is often compared by film critics to Japanese director Yasujiro Otsu, makes films that mainly focus on domestic relationships - between mother and father, father and children, mother and children, husband and wife and sisters and brothers - by capturing ordinary life and presenting the rhythm of real life - slow, sometimes even boring, but filled with tension.
The movie depicts a day in the life of the Yokoyamas. Here, family members gather for a commemorative ritual for their eldest son.
The director says he wanted to express the view that "there are so many 'too late' moments in one's life".
Recently, on a beautiful spring evening, dozens of Chinese were waiting for him at the Kubrick Bookstore in Beijing's Moma.
Neumeier choreographed a ballet to this music in 2015.
In the upcoming performance in Beijing, the choreographer added many more Chinese elements, including ancient Chinese-style costumes. The body movements of the performers were designed to resemble freehand Chinese ink paintings.
A group of leading dancers from the National Ballet of China will perform in the ballet, along with foreign opera singers and dancers.
Neumeier said a choreographer should create a completed world on stage to express his or her own ideas. Despite the fact the ballet was created based on ancient poems and music composed in the 18th century, the dance that will be performed is brand new.
"When a stage is unveiled, it is an ongoing activity. The distance between the audience and the dance is not far," Neumeier said.
Restaurateur Eldwin Chua from Singapore has launched a second culinary brand in China, which features Chinese cuisine that intriguingly originated outside of China. Photos provided to China Daily
Paradise scored a hit in Shanghai with its colorful dumplings. Now, the chain has a new offering: food from the Chinese diaspora. Xu Junqian gets behind the scenes with the CEO.
You have to be brave or crazy to come to Shanghai, a city that is already packed with stores offering xiaolongbao and claims the soup dumpling as its own－and start selling your own version from another country.
That's what Singaporean restaurateur Eldwin Chua did in 2013, when he brought his Paradise Dynasty to Shanghai, where it became an instant hit.
"If I get people from the home country of the dumpling to crave my dumpling, I think I am capable of getting them to try any of my foods," Chua tells China Daily on a recent visit to Shanghai. He was in the city launching his second culinary brand, Paradise Classic, which features Chinese cuisine that intriguingly originated outside of China.
Chua started his trajectory in the food world at the age of 13, with an entry-level position at McDonald's.
Now, at 40, he's at the helm of a restaurant empire that boasts 13 brands with more 60 outlets around the globe, employs some 1,200 staff in and outside the kitchen, and makes $120 million in revenue in 2016. Paradise Group was the top restaurant group in Singapore by revenue last year.
Ridley Scott, director of the sci-fi Alien series. AFP
PARIS - Alien creator Ridley Scott says he was convinced that there are aliens out there - and one day they will come for us.
"I believe in superior beings. I think it is certainly likely. An expert I was talking to at NASA said to me, 'Have you ever looked in the sky at night? You mean to tell me we are it?' That's ridiculous.
"The experts have now put a number on it having assessed what is out there. They say that there are between 100 and 200 entities that could be having a similar evolution to us right now."
He jokes that when you see a big thing in the sky, run for it.
"Because they are a lot smarter than we are, and if you are stupid enough to challenge them you will be taken out in three seconds."
The "neomorph" aliens in the new film are based on the goblin shark "which has a jaw which hinges in two ways. It's scary, hideous beyond belief actually", says Scott, the 79-year-old British-born director, who was also the brains behind Blade Runner.
"When I did the first Alien, I had to get a sense of responsibility because the reaction to the kitchen scene with John Hurt was beyond anything I expected - and it was not good," he says.
"But the film was very successful because people are perverse."
He says he could not believe the terror he had created when he went to see people watching the film.
"Everybody was half underneath the seat watching by the time you get to the kitchen scene. There was a woman underneath the seat with her husband holding her. I said this is not healthy."
Scott, however, claims that he was not shocked.
"If there is a problem I tend to close down into calm. When you walk in, in the morning, on a film and 600 people turn and all look at you, that is scary," he says.

Thanks to hits such as The Great Hypnotist and Miss Granny, Leste Chen is one of the most commercially successful Taiwan directors in the Chinese mainland market.
A best-selling author, played by A-list actor Huang Bo, tries to erase memories of his estranged wife, played by Xu Jinglei, but accidentally obtains a serial killer's memory. The film was released on the mainland on April 28.
"I had never done such a movie before. And the most difficult part was that I had no precedent to follow," says Chen at a promotional event in Beijing Film Academy.
"It (the filming) was like walking on a tightrope. I needed to be very cautious," he adds.
"The props and sets were unique. The script was revised around 80 times. I hope it (the film) is something brand-new," says Chen.
China saw around 700 feature-length movies made last year, and the main genres were fantasy, action and comedy.
Meanwhile, China saw a rise in plans for sci-fi films in 2015, mainly due to the landmark win of that year's Hugo award by Chinese novelist Liu Cixin, the first Asian to win the prestigious prize.
But only a few of those movies have hit theaters, and almost none of those released have succeeded in the box office or received critical acclaim.
Nearly 60 years after the Smurfs first appeared in a European magazine, a new animated feature has brought the blue-skin humanoids back to the big screen.
The movie was released in the United States on April 7.
Unlike the previous two movies, The Smurfs in 2011 and The Smurfs 2 in 2013, which were hybrids of live-action and animation, the latest Smurf feature is completely an animated work.
The movie centers on Smurfette and her three best friends - Brainy, Clumsy and Hefty - whose adventures lead to the discovery of a mysterious village full of female Smurfs.
In an introduction tailored for the Chinese market, its director Kelly Asbury says the movie is a homage to the original comic strips created by Belgian cartoonist Pierre Culliford, more popularly known as Peyo.
"People love (the) Smurfs. We don't want to give them something else," says Asbury, the American director known for Shrek 2 and Gnomeo & Juliet.
He says animators mimicked the style of Peyo and inserted a scarecrow and a glass jar, which appeared in the original comic strips, for diehard fans.
The eyes (of the movie characters) are joined and there is no gap between their eyes. So, when a character has an expression of surprise on its face, you will see the eyebrows move above onto the hat, says Asbury.
He also says that thanks to an international crew, most of whom grew up watching and reading the Smurf stories, staying faithful to the characters was one of their delights.

Learning culture is mainly about experiencing culture
The other is culture in life. For example, during each Spring Festival, we exclaim that the new year atmosphere is disappearing, and young people are detaching from tradition. If we put Qingming Festival, Duanwu Festival into textbooks, then will young people get more interested in the traditional festivals? It is very important to capture their interest first through education.
2. So how does one arouse their interest to get closer to traditional culture?

Modern ink master Pan Tianshou (1897-1971) pushed the creation and education of Chinese ink-brush painting to a new height, in the wake of a crisis of classic Chinese art in the first half of the 20th century.
He explored forming a distinctive style of grandeur and magnificence in the realm of flower-and-bird painting, when this traditional genre had lost its appeal to people's taste at the time.
Marking the 120th anniversary of Pan's birth, the Hangzhou-based China Academy of Art, which Pan headed, is organizing an exhibition at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing.
The exhibition through May 14 shows Pan's 120 paintings reviewing his most celebrated figures and series of rocks and eagles.

During the event, the museum announced that its flagship food store "Regard from the Emperor" is officially available online at Tmall, and a series of food made according to ancient recipes during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) are now on sale.
According to Lou Wei, the deputy curator the Palace Museum, the food are all created and produced by time-honored brands like Shou Quan Zhai, and marks an attempt to combine China's traditional food culture with people's online shopping habits.

Cinco de Mayo, or the fifth of May, celebrates the day Mexico drove out occupying French forces in 1862. The date is often confused with Mexico's independence day - that's actually Sept 16, which marks the beginning of the country's war of independence from Spain.
The "holiday" has been called an invention of bars and beer companies along the Texas-Mexico border, where for decades the only wall has been a huge pile of empty Corona bottles on the morning of May 6. Marked in Mexico by military parades, Cinco de Mayo in the US has become a week-long celebration of Mexican-American culture. The fun has spread around the world, and Mexican eateries around China will embrace the party spirit on Friday.
As a native Texan, I took the opportunity of the upcoming holiday to check out a Mexican eatery in Beijing with Texas roots.
Lucky Lopez is far from the flashiest Mexican restaurant in town - nearby hotspots like Q Mex and Cantina Agave will have much livelier Cinco de Mayo parties this weekend. But Lucky Lopez, hidden in an alley near Sanlitun's bar street, offers home-style fare that owner-manager June Chow's Dallas neighbors would recognize immediately.
"We make our horchata fresh every morning," says Chow of the traditional Mexican milk-based drink with a touch of cinnamon, a great palate cooler if your food choices are a bit spicy. A source of pride here are the flour tortillas, also fresh-made daily with a tortilla press Chow toted over from the US. These are indeed beautifully soft and satisfying, especially for Americans who tend to prefer flour tortillas to Mexico's almost sacred corn versions.

"I have had many offers to write pop songs but I turned them down. I want to do other things," says Gu, 82.
Since 2005, she has composed 50 songs with classical literature as lyrics that are meant to deepen the understanding of traditional culture among children and the youth.
The China Oriental Performing Arts Group will perform many of the songs in Beijing on May 31. Ahead of the Beijing concert, Gu and the group launched a tour of Northeast China on April 15. The performers sang songs composed by Gu in college campuses, including Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang University and Northeast Forestry University.
"I hope the songs will be included in educational material in schools. This could be my final contribution," says Gu.
Gu got the idea of combining traditional Chinese text with music more than a decade ago when a friend told her that children here have few choices in music－"they either listen to pop songs for adults or songs from cartoon films".
"Music is important for the development of a person, from childhood and adolescence to adulthood. As a younger mother, I wanted my children to listen to good music," she adds.

Some 100 antique Chinese bronze mirrors are now on show at the Tsinghua University Art Museum, through April 30, 2018.
The exhibition is titled Bizhong Bixin, or Loyalty and Faith. It is from an inscription on one shown mirror of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220). It is a motto saying that when people keep loyal and honest, they will become close to each other; otherwise, they will lose confidence in each other and isolate each other.
The exhibited objects are from a donation of 274 bronze mirrors, including 100 from Japan to the museum made by Wang Ganghuai, 76, a Tsinghua alumnus.
Chinese food lovers around the globe are fuming over a video by Time Out London that is "manhandling" traditional soup dumplings.
The video, originally posted on Time Out London's Facebook page on March 28, shows a diner attempting to burst a xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and throw away the soup, often considered the essence of the little parcels of culinary joy.
"They're super dribbly and also very satisfying to watch," the video continued as a diner breaks the dumpling with chopsticks.
The post has received more than one million views, and more than 4,400 comments, most of them critical.

The 4th Xinghao Youth Script and Creative Designing Competition and Award Ceremony was held at the Beiguo Theater of Beijing Normal University on May 4 as a part of the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival.
"A successful film may involve many factors such as a good director, popular performers or brilliant visual effects, but a failed one must have a close relationship with the quality of a certain script," Wang Hailin, renowned Chinese playwright, said at the competition.
"College students represent the most vigorous and passionate group in the entire society. When you devote yourselves to writing scripts, you may be faced with many temptations like money, power, glory or status, but you should not forget your original will, and stick to your dream," he added.
Since its call for scripts one month ago, a total of 540 creative scripts from various fields were sent by students from many top universities, including Beijing Film Academy, The Central Academy of Drama, Shanghai Theatre Academy, Communication University of China, Peking University, Fudan University.
Eighteen candidates’ scripts were selected for the final competition. There were three second prize winners, five third prize winners and 10 consolation prizes awarded.
In the sci-fi thriller Battle of Memories, which hit Chinese mainland theaters on April 28, Xu stars as the wife of an author who is involved into a series of murders.
"Many years ago I began to think acting had become boring, so I chose to gradually shift to the directing and producing," she said at recent media event. "But when I read the script of Battle of Memories, it hooked me".
Plans for railways linking the planned Xiongan New Area in Hebei province with neighboring Beijing and Tianjin were disclosed recently on a map of the region's railway links, marking the latest step in the new area's development.
Railway lines from Xiongan to Beijing and Tianjin were revealed, along with three other links, on a Tianjin railway planning map, according to a report in Tianjin News.
According to the report, the map shows two railway stations in the new area－Xiongan Railway Station and Xiongan East Railway Station.
The Beijing-Xiongan rail route will connect Xiongan New Area with Beijing's planned second airport, 55 kilometers to the north of Xiongan.
The Tianjin-Xiongan railway route will connect the area with Tianjin's new railway station, which is also in the planning stages.
Details of the railways in Xiongan were not given.
The coming Xiongan New Area, an economic zone announced about a month ago, is located at the center of a triangular area with Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital, at the corners.
It covers Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties in Hebei and will eventually span 2,000 square kilometers and has a population of up to 2.5 million.
With good road and rail access, Xiongan residents will be able to reach any of the three cities in about 30 minutes, Xinhua News Agency reported.
Under the area's development plan, a major transportation network should be in place in Xiongan by 2020. The area will be well connected to Beijing, Tianjin and other cities in Hebei by 2022, when the Winter Olympic Games are held, according to Xinhua.
Xiongan New Area is intended to house the bulk of Beijing's noncapital functions, including some administrative and public institutions, company headquarters, financial institutions, higher education institutions and sci-tech units.
Officials say that to enhance the area's attractiveness to top-level talent, it should develop with "people" being the core by improving public services, promoting social life and being equipped with superior resources in such areas as education and medical care, according to a China Central Television report on Tuesday.
"I personally think the resources at Xiongan will be superior to those currently available in Beijing and Tianjin," He Lifeng, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, said in the report.
Yuan Tongli, vice-governor of Hebei, said: "We need to take innovative steps to bring down housing prices and lift public services in the area." Only this will attract top talent, Yuan said.
YOKOHAMA — The Belt and Road Initiative is very important and will certainly have a good impact on regional growth and prosperity, said Mitsuhiro Furusawa, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on Saturday.
Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of Silk Road.
The initiative is very important to foster regional cooperation in areas of trade, investment and finance and to provide much needed infrastructure for the region, Furusawa said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua here on the sidelines of the 50th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank.
Furusawa said, "Global growth is picking up, and also in China ... We see the growth momentum," he said.
Last month, the IMF upgraded its forecast for China's economic growth in 2017 to 6.6 percent, and global economic growth to 3.5 percent, both up 0.1 percentage points from its January projections.
As for the ongoing process of the Chinese RMB's internationalization, he said that it is both beneficial for China and for other countries.
"The Chinese currency's internationalization goes hand in hand with Chinese economic growth. We hope that Chinese RMB will be internationalized, as it was already included in SDR basket of currencies," he said.
This year marked the 20th anniversary of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Furusawa said that the world has learned a lot from the Asian financial crisis.
"Good policies are the best defense," he said, adding that a lot of progress has been made by Asian countries to prevent a recurrence of the crisis, including having more flexible exchange systems, enhancing regional cooperation, and creating financial safety nets.
The IMF is also making its own contributions to this progress, with its various tools, policy advice and financial assistance, and by creating a stronger global financial safety net, he added.
"There are always risks and challenges ... We should always wrestle with those challenges," he said.
It was a sweltering Saturday afternoon when the mercury hit 90 degrees around 3 pm; Nikki White was one of the many sitting on the edge of the sidewalk across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
She was one of tens of thousands of protesters in Washington participating in the People's Climate March on Saturday.
The protesters started from Capitol Hill around 12:30 pm and marched on Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House, ending at the Washington Monument.
White said she was quite disappointed in US President Donald Trump for doubting climate change.
"So he won't fund it; he takes away funds from it," she told China Daily, referring Trump's plan to cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
White noted that climate change affects every country. "A decision made in the US affects Canada," said White, who is originally from the US but moved to Canada. She was visiting her family in Washington.
"Anything he stands for has nothing to do with what I stand for. It's the opposite," White said.
During his presidential campaign, Trump called climate change a "hoax" created by the Chinese and said he will pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. Since taking office, his administration has rolled back some Obama-era regulations on fossil fuels.
On Friday, the EPA removed some climate change information from its website. In a press release, the EPA said the website is undergoing changes to reflect the agency's new direction under Trump and administrator Scott Pruitt.
In a rally on Saturday evening in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump said he will make a big decision regarding the Paris accord next week, but did not provide details.
An estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people took part in the rally in Washington on Saturday, according to The Washington Post, quoting the number given to the National Park Service by march organizers. Saturday was Trump's 100th day in office.
The same People's Climate March, which originated in New York in September 2014, also took place on the same day in many other US cities as well as some cities outside the US.
Robert Labaree came from Boston to join the rally in Washington. He said his wife participated in the Boston rally.
"The administration is just too deep in the pocket of large corporations, especially the fossil fuel industry. It seems quite clear," he told China Daily. He also took part in the tax rally on April 15 and science march on April 22, both in Boston.
Marching in the procession included a brass band. Some were dancing while holding their signs. The signs were mostly colorful. One blue sign read "Protect Water" while a red one said "Planet on Fire".
One man, with a white beard and wearing a green cap, held a sign that proclaimed "Oceans Are Rising, So Are We."
An elderly woman sitting in a wheelchair held a sign that reads: "I am 91, Mother Earth is even older than me, Respect your elders."
Another woman, her body wrapped with a US national flag, held a sign stating "Climate Patriot."
A Gallup poll released on March 14 shows that a record percentage of Americans are concerned about global warming, believe it is occurring, consider it a serious threat and say it is caused by human activity.
The perceptions are up significantly from a 2015 poll. Some 45 percent of Americans now say they worry "a great deal" about global warming, up from 37 percent a year ago and significantly higher than the low point of 25 percent in 2011.
Another 21 percent say they worry "a fair amount" about global warming, while only 18 percent say they worry "only a little"; 16 percent said they worry "not at all".
Randy Orwig, from North Carolina, told China Daily that he went to the protest to make sure the environment is taken seriously.
Orwig said he doesn't believe Trump represents the long-term interests of the United States and the world.
"We are going to resist. We are going to find ways to work around him. We are going to be working in the local governments, municipal governments and continue to make climate important," he told China Daily.
China and the US are the two largest carbon emitters in the world, but per capital carbon emission in the US is more than twice that in China.

The war against malaria has made progress over the past decade, but there is still a long way to go, and Chinese researchers are leading the way on more than one front.
Roughly half of the world's population - 3 billion people - still remains at risk.
In 2006, there were 266 million cases a year leading to 750,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.
By 2015, the numbers had diminished, but remained huge - 212 million cases, 429,000 deaths.
And a staggering 90 percent of all cases are in Africa.
Dr Deng Changsheng, manager of the department of science and technology at Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, told a group of 27 journalists visiting from Africa recently, that strategy used to cause a major decline in malarial regions of China is showing promise in Africa.
The approach is called fast elimination of malaria by source eradication (FEMSE). It involves mass drug administration (MDA) of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) - in other words, clearing an affected population of the malarial parasites by mass drug administration.
Artemisinin, by the way, is the drug that won 85-year-old Chinese pharmacologist Tu Youyou the 2015 Nobel Prize for Medicine. She had mined the recipe, derived from the sweet wormwood plant, from the annals of ancient Chinese medicine. Today it saves hundreds of thousands of lives a year in Africa alone.
The drug has not been cheap, but Deng said the cost could be brought to as low as $15 per person over the next decade. Today it's about $40, according to Deng.
Thanks to a worldwide push, ACT treatments rose from 187 million in 2010 to 311 million in 2015.
The big fear facing the effort right now is that the parasites are showing signs of developing a resistance to artemisinin, the same way some strains of tuberculosis are shunning off some of modern medicine's most potent antibiotics.
"The spread of artemisinin resistance in Africa would be a major setback in the fight against malaria, as ACT is the only effective and widely used anti-malarial treatment at the moment," writes Professor Arnab Pain of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
"Therefore it is very important to regularly monitor artemisinin resistance on a worldwide scale," he added.
The study, led by Jun Cao of the Institute for Parasitic Diseases in China, found drug-resistant malarial parasites in a Chinese patient who had been in Equatorial Guinea and returned to China. The ACT therapy, which usually takes three days to rid the patient of the disease, took five days in this case.
This "partial resistance", they said, has been noted in other parts of Southeast Asia, and the great fear is that "partial" morphs into "complete".
"This is one of the great challenges facing us in the fight against malaria," the World Health Organization says on its website.
The holy grail of that fight, of course, remains a vaccine, and The Associated Press reports that three African nations have just been chosen to test the world's first malaria vaccine.
WHO announced Monday that Ghana, Kenya and Malawi will begin piloting an injectable vaccine next year with hundreds of thousands of young children, who have been at highest risk of death.
The vaccine, which has partial effectiveness, has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives if used with existing measures, WHO's regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said in a statement. The challenge is whether impoverished countries can deliver the required four doses of the vaccine for each child.
The vaccine will be tested on children 5 to 17 months old to see whether its protective effects shown so far in clinical trials can hold up under real-life conditions. At least 120,000 children in each of the three countries will receive the vaccine, which has taken decades of work and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.
Kenya, Ghana and Malawi were chosen for the vaccine pilot because all have strong prevention and vaccination programs but continue to have high numbers of malaria cases, WHO said. The countries will deliver the vaccine through their existing vaccination programs.
WHO is hoping to wipe out malaria by 2040, despite the increasing resistance problems to both drugs and insecticides used to kill mosquitoes.
The vaccine was developed by GlaxoSmithKline, and the $49 million for the first phase of the pilot is being funded by the global vaccine alliance GAVI, UNITAID and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

PARIS - The campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said in a statement late Friday it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
A large trove of documents were released online earlier Friday including emails, accounting documents and contracts from the campaign of the centrist candidate.
The files were posted anonymously on a sharing website and the person responsible for the posting remains unclear.
Macron's political movement En Marche! (On the Move) later confirmed that it had been hacked.
"The files circulating were obtained several weeks ago by hacking into private and public mailboxes of several leaders of the movement," said the statement.
It also said the leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation."
"It is not a simple hacking operation but an attempt to destabilize the French presidential election," said the movement, adding that it will "take all necessary initiatives with public and private actors" to clarify the incident.
The leakage happened within the final hours of the last campaigning day. Macron is to face off with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote on Sunday.
Macron has maintained his centriest position over Le Pen, according to surveys conducted by French pollsters.
The latest poll released on Thursday by the French Institute of Public Opinion showed that 61 percent of votes will go to Macron and 40 percent to Le Pen, consistent with the poll conducted before.




 
Oysters wreak havoc on Denmark's seashore. Photo from Danish Embassy's Sina Weibo account.
The Danish Embassy published a story on Monday evening on its official Sina Weibo account, China's twitter-like social network, about the problems for their country caused by an invasion of the exotic oysters. Chinese internet users enthusiastically responded with much discussion about ways to address the issue on Weibo, then WeChat, another popular social media network.
The embassy makes a small joke in the post to invite Chinese people to eat oysters in Denmark which triggered heated debate. Apparently, when it comes to eating, Chinese people are very serious and they already started to make plans for their oyster journey.
The most popular comment came from someone suggesting oyster visas should be issued "with 10 years' unlimited round trips and one-month-long stay and I can eat up them all in five years" received over 10,000 likes. There are people even recommending visa-free and oyster immigration policies in China.
Chinese internet users make comments below the Danish Embassy's post to address the oyster issue. Screeshot of the Danish Embassy's Sina Weibo
The oysters, known as Pacific oysters, are a new species in Denmark and have caused huge damage to the seashore's ecological environment. Their proliferation is unstoppable since they have no natural enemies there. People have to get across them in shoes before swimming. What's worse, their occupation leads to the endangerment of the Limfjord, a Danish local oyster.
Scientists and fishermen made numerous complaints to the nation's conservation authority but the thorny issue remains unsolved. They also encouraged local people to bring them to their dining tables and few were motivated.
The Danish Embassy is very grateful for Chinese people's innovative advice such as building oyster sauce factories and organizing oyster-dining journeys. It also said as long as China permits, they'd love to export oysters to China.

SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions."
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back".
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors.
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being.
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions.
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership."
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.




 
BEIJING - The People's Bank of China, the central bank, will issue a set of gold and silver coins on Monday commemorating the upcoming Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on May 14 and 15.
Consisting of one gold coin and two silver, the set will be legal tender in China, the central bank said in a statement.
The front side of each coin features China's national emblem, along with the country name and the year of issuance.
The 3-gram gold coin, with a face value of 50 yuan ($7.26), features the forum's logo, the Chinese and English names for the forum and lotus decoration on the reverse side.
The 30-gram and 15-gram silver coins, with face values of 10 yuan and 5yuan, will also have the forum's logo and full name in both languages, but with different decoration patterns on the reverse sides, according to the statement.
China and South Africa's relationship will reach new heights when Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Yandong makes an official visit to the country this month.
A major part of Liu's visit to the southernmost tip of the African continent is to launch the China-South Africa High-Level People-to-People and Cultural Exchanges Mechanism, which will be co-hosted with Nathi Mthethwa, South Africa's minister of arts and culture.
This mechanism, the first of its kind between China and African countries, covers cooperation in a wide range of areas such as education, culture, science and technology, health, youth, women, media, think tanks, tourism, sports and local friendship.
Speaking at a regular news conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Liu's visit to South Africa is seen as an important part of the consensus reached by the two heads of state.

"This mechanism is of high significance aswe build up popular support for China-South Africa friendship, deepen our comprehensive strategic partnership and expand people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Africa," Geng said.
During the visit, Liu will also meet with South African President Jacob Zuma and attend the China-Africa Conference on Health Cooperation, the China-South Africa seminar on industrial park cooperation, the China-South Africa High-Level Dialogue and the closing ceremony of the second China-Africa Youth Gala.
South Africa is the last stop during her four-nation tour, which also was to take her to Turkey, Jordan and Iran. In Turkey, Liu conveyed President Xi Jinping's greetings to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and congratulated him on the passage of Turkey's constitutional referendum.
With the backing of Xi and Zuma, the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and South Africa has been growing.
Foremost, the visit of Liu to South Africa is important because the solid foundation of Africa-China engagements is cemented by mutual high-level visits, says Bob Wekesa, post-doctoral fellow at the University of the Witwatersr in Johannesburg.
The cultural exchanges mechanism launched during the visit builds on the existing engagements and will likely see to the implementation of tangible and pragmatic projects at the economic, political and social levels, says Wekesa.
"Without exchanges, the engagements would be limited to high-level relations, and this would not aid the benefits that arise when academics, businesspeople and ordinary Africans and Chinese people make contact with, and learn from, each other."
"The exchange mechanism launched during the visit will indeed spur the implementation of the people-to-people initiatives," says Wekesa.
In September 2015, Zuma attended the Commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1937-45) and the World War II in Beijing.
This was closely followed by a state visit from Xi to South Africa in December 2015, during which the China-South Africa 5-10 Year Framework on Cooperation was signed.
Xi and Zuma co-chaired the Johannesburg Summit, which came as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation marked the 15th anniversary of its establishment and is the first summit between the two sides on the African continent.
The historic meeting, which approved a declaration and an action plan for cooperation in the coming three years, has strengthened solidarity and cooperation between China and Africa. The upcoming China-South Africa High-Level People-to-People and Cultural Exchanges Mechanism is a concrete example of implementing the outcomes of the FOCAC.
South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the two countries are enjoying strong growth momentum, with deals worth more than 94 billion rand ($7.1 billion; 6.6 billion euros; ￡5.5 billion) signed during Xi's visit - making it the most successful state visit in South African history.
"The subsequent Johannesburg Summit assured us of China's commitment not only to South Africa, but to the entire African continent," he says.
"The outcomes of these two events are changing the lives of our people, not only in South Africa but also on the African continent, and are offering new opportunities for growth and development at a number of levels, but more especially at an economic level," Ramaphosa adds.
Trade between the two countries grew from 118 billion rand to 293 billion rand by the end of 2015, making China the biggest trading partner of South Africa.
More than 300 Chinese companies are in South Africa, and among them, about 140 are large and medium-sized companies, according to a report by the South Africa-China Economic and Trade Association.
The report says the Chinese enterprises employed more than 26,000 people in South Africa, of whom 24,000 were locals, and Chinese investment in South Africa exceeded $13 billion by the end of 2015.

CHICAGO - A passenger, who was violently dragged off an overbooked United flight has reached a settlement with the airline, his lawyer said on Thursday.
Thomas Demetrio, a prominent Chicago attorney representing the 69-year-old David Dao, said in a news release that "the United has taken full responsibility for what happened on Fight 3411" on April 9.
He didn't disclose the sum, which should "remain confidential" as agreed by the two sides.
Dao, a Vietnamese-American doctor, was hospitalized after three aviation policemen at Chicago O'Hare International Airport was summoned aboard and dragged him from the plane to make space for four crew members on the flight bound for Louisville, Kentucky.
He suffered concussion, a broken nose and lost two front teeth, which led to an online uproar against the misconduct.
Demetrio praised United for taking "full responsibility for what happened on Flight 3411, without attempting to blame others, including the City of Chicago."

[Photo/Agencies]
WASHINGTON - As a sudden but predicted victory for US President Donald Trump, Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday pushed through a new version of American Health Care Act aimed to repeal and replace Obamacare, by 217 to 213 votes.
The bill was passed in the House with only one more vote than needed. All Democrats voted against the bill on the House floor, while 20 Republicans voted no. The Obamacare repeal, one of Trump's key campaign promises, would usher in sweeping changes to the US health care system in the coming years.
TRUMP EXALTS VICTORY
The vote was thought a major breakthrough for Trump who failed to get any major legislations passed by the Congress during his first 100 days in the White House.
Following the voting, Trump, together with Vice President Mike Pence and dozens of House Republicans, celebrated the victory at the White House Rose Garden, touting the bill as a "great plan" while claiming Obamacare "essentially dead."
"This has really brought the Republican Party together," Trump said. "As much as we've come up with a really incredible health care plan, this has brought the Republican Party together. We're going to get this finished."
"It's going to be an unbelievable victory... when we get it through the Senate." he said.
"A lot of us have been waiting seven years to cast this vote," House Speaker Paul Ryan said earlier Thursday.
House Republican leaders had scrambled for enough support before the voting after having a series of changes added since an earlier version was pulled from a House floor voting at last minute in March.
Also on the day, frustrated Democrats warned that the Obamacare repeal will leave Americans worse off.
"Make no mistake, many people will die as a result of this bill," House lawmaker Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida, said on ABC.
Sensing the challenges ahead in the Senate, Pence told the crowd: "Welcome to the beginning of the end of Obamacare."

Wildlife movie coproduction shows angle not known to many
Born in China, a Chinese-American wildlife documentary coproduction, has been offering US moviegoers a feast for the eyes and food for thought since opening in US theaters a day before Earth Day, April 22.
The film's stunning imagery was captured over three years, largely in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces, and it follows the lives of pandas, golden monkeys and snow leopards, with additional footage of red-crowned cranes and chiru, or Tibetan antelopes. It was coproduced by Disneynature and Shanghai Media Group.
"The film serves to increase humans' awareness of the importance and urgency of protecting wildlife," Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said at a reception at China's embassy in Washington on Friday.
"Besides, we can learn much from animals, such as pandas, on how to coexist peacefully and harmoniously," Cui told a group of US guests before the showing of the film.
Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of the US State Department, told China Daily, "It would be good for American audiences to see Chinese people caring about the planet, and conserving wildlife and natural spaces."
Roy Conli, producer of Born in China, said he had been "totally unaware" of the wilderness of China, including what was happening on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and in the mountains of Sichuan, before the making of the film.
"It just shows you how wondrous this planet is," said Conli, the Oscar-winning producer of Big Hero 6. "We need to protect animal populations ... in order to protect ourselves."
For Lu Chuan, an accomplished Chinese director, directing the film allowed him to share the beauty of China, and Chinese people's attitude toward life.
"This is a film that will tell our audience that besides Beijing and Shanghai, and besides heavy industries and pollution, China has incredibly beautiful sides that many are hardly aware of - the crystal clear skies, the stunning sceneries and wildlife habitats," Lu said.
In addition to appearing at US theaters, Born in China will be rendered into a dozen languages and later released in over 100 countries and regions, according to Cui Yuying, vice-minister of the State Council Information Office.
Cui said the China-US coproduction is emblematic of the decision at the April Mar-a-Lago meeting of President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump to ratchet up bilateral exchanges, including cultural and people-to-people exchanges.
"The State Council Information Office welcomes and will continue to support international organizations to tell China stories ... to ramp up understanding and friendship between Chinese and people in the US and the rest of the world," she said.
The film's Chinese version was released in August. A trailer is available at nature.disney.com.

"We are not going to let other countries take advantage of us anymore," he said Saturday in Harrisburg at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and Expo Center. "From now on it's going to be America first."But even as he returned to friendly political turf in Pennsylvania, Trump seems caught between his role as an outsider candidate and that of a now-elected negotiator.
He's still figuring out how to deal with the very insiders he vowed to drain from Washington's "swamp." He's spent 100 days being educated on the slow grind of government even in a Republican-dominated capital, and watching some of his promises —from repealing former President Barack Obama's health care law to temporarily banning people from some Muslim nations — fizzle.
Even with his return to Pennsylvania, Trump seemed torn between who he was courting. He opened the rally with an extended attack on the media, pointing out that he was choosing to stay away from the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner.
"I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles way from Washington's swamp," he said, "spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people, right?"He then suggested that he might attend the dinner next year — but added that he'd also consider returning to Pennsylvania.
The state was critical to Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in November. Trump won Pennsylvania with 48 percent of the vote, the first time the state had voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988.
The price of ivory in China has dropped sharply - from $2,100 per kilo in 2014 to $730 in February - and that's good news for elephants.
Wildlife conservation groups worldwide have been applauding China's plans to end the legal trade in ivory later this year (instead of the end of 2021 as has originally been planned). Now a new survey of ivory prices in markets across China by Save the Elephants, a leading elephant conservation group, suggests those plans may already be having a positive impact.
Chinese demand for tusks has been blamed for driving African elephants toward extinction and the Chinese government in recent years has taken steps to stop the trade in ivory, which is used for ornaments and souvenirs. China's ivory factories were to have been shut down by last Friday, followed by the closing of retail outlets by the end of this year.
Harry Peachey, an adviser to the International Elephant Foundation, calls the drop in prices since 2014 "a harbinger of what will happen once the market is shut down completely."
Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increased. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Some conservationists estimate that up to 20,000 elephants have been killed by poachers every year to meet demand.
"This is a critical period for elephants," said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, president and founder of Save the Elephants, which carried out the new survey.
"With the end of the legal ivory trade in China, the survival chances for elephants have distinctly improved. We must give credit to China for having done the right thing by closing the ivory trade. There is still a long way to go to end the excessive killing of elephants for ivory, but there is now greater hope for the species," he said.
Other factors behind the drop in the price of ivory include a slowing economy with fewer people able to afford luxury goods, and a crackdown on corruption that has dissuaded business people from buying expensive ivory items as "favors" for government officials, the report says.
Peachey said advocacy has also helped. "Consumer education has been part of the process as China moves to shut down the trade," he told China Daily, "and those efforts might very well have played a part in both demand reduction and drop in price - let's hope so."
According to the new survey, the 130 licensed ivory outlets in China have been gradually reducing the quantity of ivory items on display for sale, and recently have been cutting prices to boost sales, the Associated Press reports.
"China has demonstrated that it is all about action and not words - in stark contrast to the United Kingdom Government, which has proclaimed itself a leader on elephant protection issues and has promised to end all domestic ivory trade in the past two election Manifestos," Will Travers, president of the Born Free Foundation told China Daily.
Travers said that the drop in price has been predictable in light of trade restrictions, political pressure, more effective field conservation, improved intelligence gathering and tougher sentencing for wildlife criminals.
"The key variable that will determine the effect on poaching is not prices. It is profits," Prof Alejandro Nadal, economist at El Colegio de Mexico, told China Daily. Without knowing how the markets are structured, he said, "We don't know how the profitability of illegal traders is being affected by these price declines."
Wildlife authorities in Kenya, the main conduit of ivory smuggling in the region, welcomed the news of a price reduction in China.
"Once they don't have an appetite for ivory it will no longer be attractive to kill elephants. We are hopeful that China will meet this deadline (to ban the ivory trade) and we will see our elephant populations restored in the parks," said Patrick Omondi, the deputy director in charge of species at the Kenya Wildlife Service.
Travers reminds us that we're not out of the woods yet, as "tens of thousands of African elephants are still losing their lives each year. Only unified action across the entire internal community can bring the trade and slaughter to an end."

Spending at least four years in the US and approximately $160,000 earning a degree that does not guarantee a high-paying job or career back in China - does this return on investment sound like an enticing deal?
The answer is still Yes, at least for many families and their children for the foreseeable future. Amanda Liu, mother of a 20-year-old who is in his third year at a local university in Shandong province, has recently been debating whether she should send her son, Yiming, to the US to continue his studies.




Liu and her husband operate a real estate company and make about $400,000 a year. "We don't see a need for our only boy to undergo any risks and hardships that are not necessary," said Liu, adding that Yiming was adamant about going to the US to earn a master's degree. "I simply can't understand why he is making his own misery."
Yiming is not alone among his peers.
According to the Ministry of Education, as of March, China had sent a total of 544,500 students abroad, making China the biggest source nation for international students worldwide. Among those more than half million overseas students, nearly 80 percent go to English-speaking countries, the top three being the US, the UK and Australia. Reasons vary why young men and women choose to study abroad. Some are interested in travel and exploring alien cultures and living in another country provides a perspective deeper than that of a tourist. Others want to improve skill sets such as language and communications or delve into a specific field of research. "I've been learning English and about American society since the age of 8," said Yiming. "How could I not go there and gain first-hand experience while self-claiming that I know the United States of America?"
Fulfilling the dream of studying in the US comes with a hefty price tag. According to the Ministry of Education, the number of self-financed students reached 498,200 in 2016, making up 91.49 percent of the total overseas Chinese student population. Among them, 328,000 are studying in US universities.
Herald Chang, a physician at the Shandong Provincial Hospital, sent his daughter for a bachelor's degree to UCLA in 2015. The annual expense is around $70,000, which includes tuition and living costs.
"It's expensive," said Chang. "But it's rewarding and worth it because studying at one of the top US institutions of higher learning enables my daughter to have access to opportunities in academics and career development she wouldn't have in China."
Chang's projection seems a bit optimistic. Based on a report published in March by overseas recruitment company Lockin China, returning Chinese students studying abroad lowered their income expectations and "are becoming more rational" as an estimated 660,000 returnees are going to join a record high 7.95 million domestic college graduates in the job market this year.
The research indicated that nearly 64 percent of the 150,000 Chinese overseas students and professionals who took the survey said their expected annual income ranged from $10,170 to $17,000.
"There have been a great number of people returning from overseas, and the number is still on the rise. This makes overseas returnees more rational in their income expectations," said Ge Wei, a manager with Lockin. In 2016, 43,250 Chinese students chose to return to China upon graduation.
Compensation package numbers are not the only indicator to justify the significance of studying abroad, said Emily, Chang's daughter.
"I also walked my path towards personal maturity and growth in all aspects," said Emily, who plans to major in Artificial Intelligence.
"The overseas programs require me to move out of my comfort zone and learn to indulge in a brand new culture and enjoy it. This experience is priceless," she added. "It strengthens my confidence and independence as I solve problems and overcome the challenges of life abroad."

Homeowners take stock of damage to their home after a tornado hit the town of Emory, Texas, US April 30, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]
Three tornadoes were confirmed by the US National Weather Service in Canton, a city about 60 miles (95 km) east of Dallas in Van Zandt County.
The winds flipped over cars, snapped trees, destroyed houses and left roads strewn with debris and fallen power lines,according to photographs and video published by the Dallas Morning News.
"We have at least four fatalities," Canton Mayor Lou Ann Everett said at a news conference on Sunday, adding that number could rise. "The damage was extensive in the affected area. It is heartbreaking and upsetting." Forty-nine people had been treated for injuries, she said.
Earlier a Canton fire department captain said he believed five people had been killed.
The mayor urged people to stay away from a sprawling flea market known as First Monday Trade Days, as crews tried to clean up debris.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent a search and rescue team to the area.
BISHKEK - The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) is taking an active part in the Belt and Road Initiative, said an EEU official on Tuesday.
Nikishina Veronika Olegovna, a member of the EEU board on trade, made the remarks at an international forum on the Belt and Road Initiative held in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.
"We are making efforts with China through innovative cooperation to eliminate trade barriers between countries," said Olegovna.
Khristenko Viktor Borisovich, president of the EEU Business Council, said the close connection between the EEU and China will produce positive results in the near future.
A declaration was issued at the forum to promote collaboration between the Belt and Road Initiative and the EEU.
The EEU, which was formed in 2015, is an economic union of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.
In 2015, Russian and Chinese leaders signed a joint statement on the interaction between the Silk Road Economic Belt and the EEU.
The Belt and Road Initiative's impact on economies across the old Silk and Maritime roads also will be one of social and cultural exchange, leading to peace and stability, said the high representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC).
"The initiative of the Belt and Road is not just economic, but also builds and promotes intercultural and interreligious [exchange]," said Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on Friday, who will attend the Belt and Road Forum on International Cooperation in Bejing in mid-May.
"In order to achieve not only a strong economy but also peace, we need stability [and we need to] work together and cooperate."
UNAOC will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to cooperate on the areas of intercultural and interreligious dialogue under the Belt and Road initiative during his visit, Al-Nasser said.
"Especially when the world today faces many big challenges, we see problems around the world coming through culture and religion," he said, "but that's why the mission of the UNAOC is leading the UN organization to promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue, and build bridges of understanding between civilizations."
The initiative, proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, is called the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and aims to build connectivity linking Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes.
More than 100 countries and organizations have joined the initiative, and about 40 countries signed the memorandum of understanding of cooperation with China.
"This means it's a very important initiative; we need something like that today to work together," Al-Nasser said, adding that it will not just be good for China, but good for the rest of the world.
"We see how much attention many many countries are paying to this," he said.
Al-Nasser, who served as the president of the 66th session of the UN General Assembly in 2011, has been UNAOC's high representative since 2013. The agency was established in 2005 to explore polarization that happens between the Western and Islamic worlds.
One of the main pillars of the UNAOC's work is on migration and refugees, and Al-Nasser said that the Belt and Road Initiative can help strengthen ties between countries that are involved in the initiative.
"We see there is rising sentiment against refugees. Many look at them as a threat of stealing jobs, causing more problems to the economy — but that's not true," he said.
"The contribution of migrants in many ways is positive. But when we deal with this, we also have to look at integration — how to educate them, to integrate them, to respect their dignity," he said. "I think now with this great initiative, this will really strengthen the cooperation between countries, especially those who are on the Silk Road."

GUANGZHOU - Several neighborhoods in the northern part of Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, have been flooded after intense rainstorms hit the area on Sunday morning.
Rainstorms hit northern Guangzhou early Sunday morning, causing landslides in mountainous areas while flooding several towns, the Guangdong provincial meteorological bureau said.
Precipitation in the Huadu, Huangpu and Zengcheng districts of Guangzhou reached 250 millimeters. There were reports of people being trapped in at least seven villages. A dike breach was also spotted in Huadong township.
More than 200 armed police officers and flood rescuers have been dispatched.
BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.
Swiss President Doris Leuthard speaks during an interview with Xinhua in Bern, Switzerland, on Jan 12, 2017. She is expected to attend the Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15. [Photo/Xinhua]
GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.
Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."
BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.
CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."
Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."

There's speculation that Ant Financial Services Group is in talks to raise over $3 billion (20.6 billion yuan) to bankroll its overseas expansion.
US tech media publication The Information reported on Thursday, citing a source close to the matter.
The finance affiliate of e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group is likely to raise the amount ahead of an initial public offering, with the timetable of the latter undisclosed, the report said.
Since its establishment in 2004 as a PayPal-like online payment platform, Ant Financial has expanded into a financial technology empire offering services ranging from small loans and credit rating to investment products.
Rumors about the fundraising plan come as Ant Financial continues a buying spree, with US money-transfer company MoneyGram its latest purchase. The $880 million deal is expected to reshape the international payments landscape.
The fintech giant's acquisitions over the past two years also include EyeVerify, a US biometric authentication tech startup, and a significant stake in India's largest mobile payment and e-commerce platform Paytm, according to Reuters.
Last year, Ant Financial raised $4.5 billion at a reported $60 billion valuation, making it China's most valuable fintech company.
Company president Eric Jing earlier told China Daily that Ant Financial hopes to replicate its success in China in the wider world, and has a goal of boosting user numbers to two billion within 10 years.

Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, has issued 10 investment-friendly policies including measures to stimulate the service and high-end industries to promote economic innovation, in a bid to improve its capacity to compete with rivals in other coastal provinces.
These 10 policies offer 49 measures, covering the aspects of overall economic development, high-end recruitment and technology, modern vocational education development, and the development of the internet of things and big data industries.
"The move is crucial to the government to serve the enterprises and promoting development. We can see that the government is determined to accelerate the process of building a new Fuzhou and setting a good example for other coastal cities," said Ni Yuefeng, Fujian's deputy Party chief.
Huang Xuexun, deputy director of Fuzhou's commerce bureau, said these policies can help Fuzhou create a good environment for innovation-driven development and take the lead in attracting domestic and overseas investment.
Under the new policies, companies with headquarters registered in Fuzhou in 2015 or later can be regarded as newly introduced headquarters.
Those companies can be rewarded up to 20 million yuan ($2.9 million) to facilitate their business development.
Besides company headquarters, sales centers and operating centers, as well as research and development centers that have reached certain standards can be regarded as headquarters, and rewarded up to 10 million yuan.
Among the measures to promote technological research and development, apart from a bonus for setting up technology and industrial design centers, companies that have developed the first set of equipment can get an extra bonus up to 2 million yuan.
The policies are also beneficial to absorbing foreign investments. According to Huang, Fuzhou's commerce bureau has a goal of attracting $1.94 billion foreign investments this year.
"The new policies are closely related to our automobile industry. Our company is going to take this opportunity to attract high-end employees, and to increase research productivity, as well as technological innovate ability, in order to better build the automobile brands of Fujian," Huang Chun, chief executive officer of Fujian Motor Industry Group Co, commented.

China's high-spending Shanghai Greenland Shenhua FC, spearheaded by expensive new signing Carlos Tevez, has apologized to fans after being dumped out of Asia's top club competition by Australian side Brisbane Roar.
Shenhua, managed by Uruguayan Gus Poyet and which also has Nigeria striker Obafemi Martins in the lineup, was blanked 2-0 in chilly conditions in Shanghai in its Asian Champions League final qualifying round clash on Wednesday.
"For the shame of today's result, we offer a sincere apology to all those fans who braved the bitter cold to come to the stadium and support Shenhua," the club said in a statement on its official microblog.
"The players all did their best, and we longed to win as much as you did, but sometimes soccer can just be this cruel."
Shanghai Shenhua finished fourth in the Chinese Super League last season, 16 points behind champion Guangzhou Evergrande.
Amid of flurry of high-profile transfers by Chinese clubs, Shenhua bought Tevez from Boca Juniors in December for a reported $89.76 million and made the 32-year-old the sport's highest paid player with a reported weekly salary of $753,000.
Tevez's arrival in Shanghai came on the heels of Brazilian midfielder Oscar joining local rivals Shanghai SIPG from Chelsea in a deal believed to be worth $65 million.
Graziano Pelle, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Jackson Martinez are all recent arrivals in China, while Shanghai SIPG manager Andre Villas-Boas is also on a lucrative contract since replacing former England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson.
Shenhua's fans vented their anger at the loss.
"It would be better to spend this huge money on stellar coaches than huge annual salaries for these players," said one fan in a post on Sina Weibo.
"The season hasn't even started yet and we're out of the Asian Champions League. The crowd is already losing hope."
China's quota on foreign film imports is likely to be expanded and Hollywood will get a greater share of box office revenue after officials and film industry executives from both countries meet to renegotiate trade terms later this month, China's state media reported on Friday.
The English edition of the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Global Times, predicted that a dozen more films will be added to the current quota of 34, citing local industry experts. They also forecast that the share of box-office revenue that US distributors are entitled to receive will increase toward the international average of 40 percent from the current 25 percent.
The reports came after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Thursday.
According to a statement issued by the White House, Trump offered Xi an affirmation of the One China policy, which has served as the basis of Sino-US relations for a generation. The White House described the conversation as "extremely cordial".
In a separate statement carried by China's Foreign Ministry, Xi said China appreciated Trump's upholding of the "one China" policy.
"I believe that the United States and China are cooperative partners, and through joint efforts we can push bilateral relations to a historic new high," the statement quoted Xi as saying.
China uses various means to protect its growing domestic film industry from Hollywood domination, including the strict quota limiting the number of foreign movies allowed into the local market on revenue-sharing terms. Under the current five-year deal, which was signed by former Vice-President Joe Biden and Xi in February 2012, China accepts 34 overseas films per year, with 14 of the titles required to be 3D or large-format movies.

Former world No 1 Maria Sharapova has been invited to play at the Madrid Open in May, which takes place less than two weeks after her 15-month doping ban expires, tournament organizers said on Wednesday.
The five-time Grand Slam winner has been given a wildcard for the event, which opens on May 5.
It is scheduled to be her second comeback tournament after her suspension for doping, with the Russian set to return to action at the Stuttgart Grand Prix in April.
"Sharapova requested an invitation to play in the tournament and after careful consideration we decided to give her a wild card," said tournament director and former Wimbledon champion Manolo Santana.
"Maria is one of the best players of the last 15 years and also a past winner of our tournament.
"In Madrid she always plays well and I'm sure she will come back to the courts highly motivated and hoping to do well in her first tournaments."
Following a positive test for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, Sharapova was suspended for two years by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) cut the ban by nine months last October.
Sharapova's suspension divided opinion in the sport, with some viewing her as a test case.
The Florida-based Russian, who turns 30 on April 19, had called the ITF's original ruling "unfairly harsh" because she had not intentionally violated anti-doping rules.
Meldonium was only added to the World Anti-Doping Agency list of banned substances at the start of 2016 after mounting evidence it boosted blood flow and enhanced performance.
CAS reduced Sharapova's suspension but said she "bore some degree of fault" by relying on agent Max Eisenbud to check the banned list for changes and failing to ensure he had done so.
"Sharapova is one of those players that all tennis fans want to see," said Madrid tournament CEO Gerard Tsobanian.
The tournament runs from May 6-13.
BULQIZA, Albania - The Chinese Embassy in Albania confirmed Friday that rescue teams had found three bodies of trapped Chinese mining specialists in a chrome mine here, and that the bodies are being retrieved.
Two Albanian rescue teams were sent in for the search operation, together with Albanian and Chinese mining experts, after a hydrogen gas explosion occurred in the chrome mine on Saturday, said Mehmet Hasalami, head of the Albanian Mining Rescue Unit.
The Albanian government and the Chinese Embassy have also dispatched two separate working groups to the mine in the northern Albanian town.
One Chinese miner suffered minor injuries in the accident.
The chrome mine was run by Albanian Chrome, owned by Albania's Balfin Group. The Chinese mining experts were from Wenzhou Corporation of Mining Tunnel Design and contracted by Albanian Chrome, according to the Chinese Embassy.

MINNEAPOLIS — The Minnesota Timberwolves are giving Lance Stephenson another shot in the NBA. Just how many he has left remains to be seen.
The Timberwolves signed Stephenson to a 10-day contract on Wednesday, hoping the enigmatic guard can bring some toughness and experience to a young team. With essentially a week to make an impression before the All-Star break, Stephenson will have to be on his best behavior as he tries to reclaim a place for himself.
"My job is to work hard, prove my point and show everybody I belong in this league," Stephenson said after the team's shootaround before Wednesday night's game against Toronto.
The Timberwolves were in need of depth on the wing after losing young star Zach LaVine for the season to a torn ACL. Coach Tom Thibodeau said he always liked what he saw from Stephenson when he played for the Indiana Pacers earlier in his career and often faced off against Thibodeau and the Chicago Bulls in the Central Division.
"I like the fact that he was part of some really good Indiana teams," Thibodeau said. "You already know he has it in him. Now we've got to get it out of him again."Those Pacers years were a long time ago, though. Stephenson had found a way to bottle his volatility with the Pacers, emerging as a two-way force alongside Paul George. But he left to sign a three-year deal with the Charlotte Hornets in 2014, and things went downhill.
Stephenson did not fit in with coach Steve Clifford and the Hornets and was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers the following summer. The Clippers sent him to Memphis at the trade deadline last year, and though he played well for the injury-plagued Grizzlies down the stretch, Memphis showed little interest in keeping him.
Stephenson signed with New Orleans before this season, but was waived after he suffered a groin injury that required surgery.
"He's been his own worst enemy a lot of times, and I think he'd be the first to tell you that," Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. "But a very talented young man."Sitting at home watching the league while he healed offered Stephenson some time to reflect on things. He says he comes to Minnesota with a better understanding of the game and his place in it.
"I came in as a young kid. I've seen a lot and learned a lot," he said. "I feel like I'm ready for this opportunity."The Timberwolves have five games before the All-Star break, which should give Stephenson plenty of chances to show what he has learned. Minnesota could sign him to a second 10-day contract before having to make a decision on keeping him around for the rest of the season or letting him go.
"I think it's a great opportunity," Stephenson said. "There are a lot of young, great players. I feel like I can come in with some veteran experience and try to help the team."
NANJING - A cluster of exceptionally-preserved fauna fossils has been found in east China's Zhejiang Province, it was announced today.
The fossils may help scientists understand more about the seabed in the period around a mass extinction event that occurred at the end of the Ordovician period, which was around 443-445 million years ago.
The biota, which was discovered in Anji County in northern Zhejiang, contains over 75 sponge species, many featuring preserved soft tissue.
The sponges are believed to have played a part in the recovery of the ecosystem after the mass extinction.
The end-Ordovician extinction was the first of the five big Phanerozoic extinction events on earth. Around 85 percent of species alive at the time, which were mostly in the sea, were wiped out. Attempts to model the ecosystem of the time have failed due to limited evidence.
Archeologists have said the diversity of the Anji discovery is unprecedented for any Hirnantian fossil group, and the fauna provides a unique window into a post-extinction ecosystem.
"The discovery of Anji biota proves that there was still biological activities after the extinction and previous research indicates that sponges might have been 'ecosystem engineers' following many extinctions," said Zhang Yuandong, researcher with the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The discoveries were published on the "Current Biology Journal" website by a joint team of researchers from China and Britain.
Staff at a public hospital broke guideline meant to ensure safety
The misconduct of a health worker at a hospital in east Zhejiang province has led to the HIV infections of five people, the provincial health authority said on Thursday.
The staff worker has been detained by police, it said. Administrative punishments were given to several other members of staff at the Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Hangzhou, a major local public hospital.
The misconduct, involving an unspecified procedure, put all patients undergoing the procedure at risk of contracting HIV, it said.
The provincial health and family planning administration received a report about the incident from the hospital on Jan 26 and immediately conducted HIV screenings of patients.
It's a severe medical accident and five people were confirmed to have HIV infections, the health authority said, without specifying the medical procedure or the patients' identities.
The source of the infection was said to be a patient who had contracted HIV outside of the hospital while undergoing the same procedure, investigations found.
The virus was transmitted via sharing a suction tube used in the procedure, it said.
That seriously violates a guideline for the procedure stipulating that each tube must be used for just one patient and then discarded.
The commission has ordered an overhaul of in-hospital infection control in all hospitals in the province and pledged to strengthen management and supervision over the medical practice.
Meanwhile, efforts to comfort and compensate those affected are underway, the announcement said.
Also on Thursday, an outbreak of hepatitis B was reported at a hospital in Qingdao, Shandong province, according to Beijing News.
Affected patients received dialysis at Chengyang People's Hospital, but no further details were released.
HIV and hepatitis B are both bloodborne diseases, experts said. Intrusive medical procedures such as dialysis and gastroscopy must be performed strictly according to clinical guidelines to prevent accidental infections.
But public health experts also urged the public not to panic or doubt medical safety at hospitals.
Patients are routinely and mandatorily screened for infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis before any intrusive procedures such as surgery.
Strict adherence to the clinical guidelines and sterilization works thoroughly to avert infections, experts said.

Hebei China Fortune has signed Brazilian attacking midfielder Hernanes from Juventus on a two-year contract on Feb 9.
The Qinhuangdao-based club has beaten off stern competition from Celtic, the Scottish champions, and Italian side Genoa to sign the 31-year-old. Hebei is rumored to have paid 73 million yuan ($10.6 million) for a player whose career in Italy has stalled after a frustrating eighteen months at the Italian champions.
Despite falling from Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri's plans and making only eight regular season starts, Hernanes remains an experienced player who capped 27 times for Brazil and whose speed of thought and foot will undoubtedly test the best Chinese Super League (CSL) defenses.
Headed by former Manchester City and Villarreal manager Manuel Pellegrini, Hebei are looking to improve upon their first season top flight finish of seventh. In recent months the club has frequently found itself in the international media spotlight through audacious attempts to sign elite European-based footballers. Hernanes will likely play in the hole behind Ezequiel Lavezzi and Gervinho, a trio of promising drive, invention, and pace.
Hernanes is set to meet up with his new teammates at their preseason training camp in Marbella, Spain.
Hernanes made his name in European football at Rome-based club Lazio where he was part of a resurgentBiancocelesti side that performed well in Serie A, regularly qualified for Europe and won the Coppa Italia in 2012-13.

Shanghai SIPG F.C succeeded where their city rivals, Shanghai Shenhua F.C., failed with an imperious 3-0 win against Thai side Sukhothaiin the Asian Champions League qualifying playoff on Feb 7.
The onus was certainly on André Villas-Boas' expensively assembled side to reach the group stages and the Red Eagles didn't disappoint in front of an expectant home crowd.
Although the opening half an hour proved testing, Shanghai's Brazilian trio of Hulk, Oscar, and Elkeson effectively ended the contest before the halftime whistle was blown.
Oscar's performance, in particular, will have pleased the home fans with the midfielder neatly finishing off a counter-attack into the bottom left-hand corner to put his side ahead after 34 minutes. The other goals came through a scrappy Elkeson shot and a second half own goal.
Truthfully, a resounding win was imperative against a mediocre Thai side that finished seventh in its domestic league and only qualified for the game through their success in the Thai FA Cup. Shanghai will hope the game gives them confidence leading into the Chinese Super League (CSL) season.
Villas-Boas' side have been drawn in Group F alongside F.C. Seoul, Urawa Red Diamonds, and Western Sydney. They join Guangzhou Evergrande and Jiangsu Suning in the competition with both sides having automatically qualified for the group stage through their 2016 league positions.
BEIJING - "SEE YOU IN COURT," US President Donald Trump responded on Twitter after a federal appeals court on Thursday refused to reinstate his controversial travel ban.
Refusing to see it as a major setback for the White House, Trump vowed to win the battle in the end, further cracking up an already divided nation.
MORE PARTISAN BRAWL
In response to the court's unanimous vote of "3-0," Trump said it was a "political decision." The president later told reporters that his administration would win the case "very easily."
The new ruling to block Trump's order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries was seen as a victory by Trump's challengers.
The governor of Washington state, which sued over the travel ban along with Minnesota, applauded the court's decision.
Responding to Trump's tweet of "SEE YOU IN COURT," Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said, "Mr. President, we just saw you in court, and we beat you."
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra also pledged to fight on until the executive order was permanently dismantled.
The legal disputes over Trump's hardline policy seem to have further intensified clashes between Republicans and Democrats following a heated fray over Trump's cabinet picks and nominees for other key posts.
On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions as attorney general on a mostly party line vote of 52 to 47. Betsy DeVos was greenlighted Tuesday to head Trump's Department of Education after being rescued by Vice President Mike Pence's tie-breaker in a 51-50 vote.
Rex Tillerson, Trump's pick for secretary of state, was approved 56-43.
Such a divided Senate contrasts with the past 40 years, which saw most cabinet selections overwhelmingly approved.
The partisan tension added to Trump's frustration on delays to confirm his nominees. The new US leader tweeted Tuesday: "It is a disgrace that my full cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!"
As a rebuttal, Democratic senator Patty Murray was reported as saying that Trump was shaping a cabinet that "benefits those at the top and their allies, but really hurts the workers and families."

MOSUL, Iraq - After months of fighting, Mosul residents can finally practice their favorite game again at a soccer field in the eastern part of the city — and this time without the restrictions imposed by Islamic State group militants.
The venue was closed for almost four months while Iraqi forces and militants fought a fierce battle for the city. Signs of war are still visible, with broken windows and damaged fences surrounding the field and with holes in the rooftop of the canteen.
"It was closed for three to four months and we reopened after the liberation," said Abu Laith Mohammed, the manager of the soccer field.
The field was allowed to stay open when IS controlled the area, but the militants imposed strict rules on the game, including a dress code that forced players to cut teams' insignia from their jerseys and a ban on referees' whistles.
"It wasn't as much fun," said 26-year-old Obeyda Mohammed after he finished a game one afternoon with his friends. "They introduced new rules that never existed in sports before."The players weren't allowed to wear logos or brand names on soccer shirts because the militants considered them to be idolatrous.
"I had to stand at the entrance of the pitch with scissors," said 31-year-old Mohammed Sadiq, who works at the soccer field. He then had to cut the logos of teams such as Real Madrid and Barcelona from the jerseys.
"They called them infidel logos," he said.
Soccer is very popular in Iraq and many people root for big European teams like Manchester United, Chelsea or Barcelona.
"We couldn't wear shorts. We had to wear trousers like this," said Obeyda Mohammed, pointing at a tracksuit one of his fellow players was wearing.
"But it had to be baggy, not tight. By the way, the brands and logos of companies like Adidas, Nike and the others were forbidden."The militants also ordered the referees not to use whistles during the game "because the sound would make the devils gather," the players said.
Trophies and medals were also forbidden because it was thought that they would encourage greed. Tournaments could not be organized either.
Mohammed Sadiq said there wasn't a time limit on a match, which under normal rules should last 90 minutes, and IS fighters would typically abandon the game after 15 minutes or so when they didn't feel like playing anymore.
Games also had to be stopped for prayers.
"I had to bring prayer mats for the players and put them on the football pitch and lead the prayer for them," he said.
The militants also made the players remove the five Olympic rings from the building because they said it was the sign of infidels.
"We tried to tell them it represented the five continents and had nothing to do with the infidels but it was useless. We had to bring a blacksmith with a grinder to cut them off," Mohammed Sadiq said.
From a giant salamander to a spotted deer, and both red and white foxes, Shanghai Zoo has taken in more than 1,000 animals deserted all over the city in the past year alone.
An elderly woman called the zoo recently, saying: "Please take a giant salamander from my home. I bought it because people said eating it would bring me longevity, but it keeps on crying so much that I can't fall asleep."
Shanghai Zoo is responsible for taking in rare species of wild animals from around the city. A zoo keeper surnamed Chen said she and her colleagues drove to the elderly woman's house to collect the giant salamander.
The zoo works closely with wildlife rescue stations in Shanghai. It also receives protected animals confiscated by the police, as well as those found or deserted by the public.
Chen said that from time to time, certain animals are seen as fashionable to have as pets, which often results in specific waves of deserted species. For example, one year saw lots of turtles coming in, while another saw more reptiles and parrots.
The zoo has received 14 foxes in the past year alone, Chen said, adding that most of them were once kept as pets by locals, who found foxes unsuitable as household pets after they reach puberty.
"Male foxes have a strong scent, make lots of noise and can become aggressive," Chen said, explaining why the seemingly cute cubs are far from ideal pets.
Chen and her colleagues at Shanghai Zoo have taken in animals that are first-class national protected species, such as an Oriental white stork and a Chinese crocodile lizard. They have also received animals listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, such as Siamese crocodiles, Bengal monitor lizards and slow lorises. Some species, such as an African spurred tortoise, are entirely new for the zoo and have presented zookeepers with new challenges.
According to Chen, the zoo has taken in more than 1,000 animals every year since 2015, leading to the zoo becoming overcrowded.
The Shanghai Observer reported that wild animals, including protected species, are often sold at local pet shops, including macaques and more exotic animals such as lizards and parrots.
Often people find the animals difficult to look after, so they end up at the zoo.
The zoo calls on the public not to purchase or keep wild animals against the law. "If you are interested in exotic pets, first you need to learn more about them," Chen said.
If people learn about illicit trading of wild animals, they should contact the police immediately, rather than buying the animals themselves and then passing them on to the zoo, or even worse, returning them to the wild, she said.
Animals taken in by the zoo go through a process of vaccinations, quarantine and medical treatment in case of injury or disease. If they are a local species, staff release them back into the wild when they are recovered and in a suitable condition.
BEIJING - China's central bank has warned the country's Bitcoin exchanges against margin trading and money laundering, in a further step to tighten regulation over the digital currency.
An inspection team from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) met and gave verbal warnings to company officials of nine Beijing-based Bitcoin trading platforms Wednesday afternoon, according to a PBOC statement Thursday.
The PBOC ordered the exchanges not to engage in margin trading, money laundering or practices violating laws on foreign exchange, taxation and advertising.
Trading platforms will be closed if they seriously violate the regulations, according to the statement.
The company officials were also reminded of the technology risks of Bitcoin trading.
Bitcoin, without ties to the bank or government, is underpinned by blockchain technology, a digital ledger system that uses cryptography.
It allows users to spend and transfer money anonymously, making the digital currency a handy tool for money laundering and capital flight.
With its help, investors are able to buy with Chinese yuan and sell for US dollars, effectively bypassing the annual forex purchase quota of $50,000.
China has strengthened scrutiny over illegal forex purchases amid capital outflow concerns as the yuan weakened against the US dollar.
Many exchanges also offer margin trading, which allows investors to trade Bitcoin using borrowed funds and capitalize on Bitcoin's price fluctuations but which also amplifies risk.
The value of Bitcoin surged in the second half of 2016 but plummeted after surpassing 8,000 yuan ($1,165) per unit early in January this year.
Last month, the PBOC conducted on-site checks to BTCChina, the country's biggest Bitcoin trading platform, and two other major Bitcoin exchanges, Huobi and Okcoin.
The nine exchanges warned Wednesday, included CHBTC, Btc Trade and HaoBTC.

BEIJING - China saw record expansion of outbound financial assets in 2016 as domestic investors bought overseas assets.
Outbound direct investment grew by $211 billion in 2016, up 12 percent, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
Overseas securities investment grew by about $100 billion, up about 30 percent, while foreign deposit, loan and trade credit more than doubled.
China continued to see strong inbound foreign direct investment, attracting about $153 billion, while inbound securities investment more than quadrupled, the statement said.
The capital and financial account registered a deficit of $37.6 billion in 2016 but is expected to narrow in 2017.
The SAFE expects increasing foreign investment and more rational overseas asset allocation by domestic investors.

German software company SAP SE will focus on small and medium-sized clients to grow its cloud business in China this year, after it posted its best-ever financial year in the region in 2016.
SAP's China branch announced on Wednesday that it saw triple-digit growth in its cloud business and a double-digit rise in its software and software-related service last year.
Mark Gibbs, president of SAP Greater China, said small and medium-sized enterprises will offer huge growth potential as they deploy cloud technology amid the economic slowdown.
"Small enterprises abound in China and they are the fastest-growing group in the world. They will be medium-sized companies tomorrow and big clients the day after tomorrow," Gibbs said, declining to offer detailed financial figures.
The company also said that its local data centers can offer four new cloud solutions in China, as part of its effort to facilitate local enterprises' digital transformation. One of them is its SAP Hybris Cloud for Customer, which can help enterprises stay connected to their consumers.
As of December, SAP had around 12,000 business customers in China. Globally, its 2016 revenue grew 7 percent to 22.07 billion euros ($23.5 billion).
SAP is competing with heavyweights such as Oracle Corp and Salesforce.com Inc in the nascent yet highly promising cloud sector.
Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc, said: "Its shifted focus on small and medium-sized enterprises reflects that Chinese companies are accelerating their cloud adoption."
ANKARA - A Russian jet accidentally killed Turkish soldiers in northern Syria as a result of a mistake in coordination between Turkish and Russian militaries, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said on Friday.
"According to the initial findings, the incident is a result of incorrect coordination, an incident that happened unwillingly," Kurtulmus told reporters in central Anatolian Afyon province of Turkey.
He added that the coordination mistake will be revealed over an investigation, local broadcaster CNNTurk reported.
Kurtulmus underlined the need for closer coordination with Russia to avoid such incidents.
On Thursday, a Russian war jet, conducting airstrikes against Islamic State (IS) targets in al-Bab town of Syria, hit a building where Turkish Armed Forces units were placed, killing three soldiers and wounding 11 others, according to the Turkish Armed Forces.
Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the airstrikes were launched based on coordinates provided by the Turkish military.
"It was a lack of coordination in providing coordinates. That is how I would formulate it," Peskov said.
On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin talked to his Turkish counterpart via telephone and expressed sorrow.

Luis Suarez is hoping an appeal will save him from missing the Spanish King's Cup final after being sent off for Barcelona in a bad-tempered semifinal second leg against Atletico Madrid.
Suarez scored Barcelona's goal as three players were dismissed in Tuesday's 1-1 draw that secured Barca's place in a fourth straight final, 3-2 on aggregate.
However, the Uruguayan - sent off for the first time in three years at Barca - claimed a stray elbow on Koke as the game entered stoppage time wasn't even a foul.
"It makes me laugh because it was like he (the referee) wanted to do it," Suarez told Gol Television.
"We need to see if we can appeal the second yellow because it isn't even a foul, but we already know how these things go.
"That is why I am so angry because it was absolutely nothing. The first yellow was also for the first foul I committed in the game, but you could see it coming."
However, Barca boss Luis Enrique isn't holding out too much hope of having Suarez available for May's final against either Alaves or Celta Vigo.
"You have to appeal all you think is unjust, but when you look at the precedents, you see what normally happens with appeals," said Enrique.
"Apart from the anger that the players who will miss the final feel, the important thing is that Barca has won.
"There are now only two teams that can win the Cup and we are one of them."
Barca has still to lose a King's Cup tie against anyone other than Real Madrid since 2010.
However, it was given a mighty scare by an Atletico side that enjoyed the better of the chances on the night.
"Today the luck was with us," said Enrique.
"Perhaps in these 90 minutes we didn't deserve this result, but overall, given the opponents we have faced, we deserve to be in the final."
Yannick Carrasco forced Jasper Cillessen into a fine save after just six minutes before Suarez looked to have killed off the tie just three minutes before halftime.
However, most of the action came in the second half as Barca's Sergi Roberto and Carrasco both saw second yellow cards.
Atletico then had a goal by Antoine Griezmann wrongly disallowed and watched Kevin Gameiro's penalty fly over the bar before he tied the score seven minutes from time.
"Once again despite the circumstances that they faced, the players put their bodies, souls and hearts into a passionate tie as any Atletico Madrid player has to," said manager Diego Simeone.
"We are out of the competition but we have our heads held high and the strength that we have three fantastic months ahead.
"Hopefully we can maintain what we showed against them in the second half the other day and during the 90 minutes today."
Atletico has endured a disappointing season so far as it languishes well off the pace of Barca and Real Madrid in fourth in La Liga.
But Simeone is hoping its display will spark a return to the form that took it to the Champions League final last season.
"Last year after we lost here with nine men, I went away saying I felt something good could come of it and this time I feel exactly the same," said the Argentine.
"When you lose in this manner, something special remains with the team, above all with such important competitions such as the fight we have in La Liga and the Champions League to come."

Chinese bike-sharing app Mobike has become a pacesetter in the race for control of the country's developing bike-on-demand sector, a data provider's analysis has found.
According to the latest statistics released by Trustdata, by the end of last year, China's bike-sharing monthly active users (MAU) had reached to 4.32 million. Mobike achieved 72.5 percent of the market share, accounting for more than 3.13 million MAU.
"As of last December, Mobike took the crown, followed by Ofo, Youon Bike and Black Bird Bike, to become the top four apps with highest MAU hit on the market," said the consulting company in a detailed report that elaborated on the country's mobile internet development in 2016.
Founded in 2014, Mobike is one of the fastest-growing bike-sharing companies in China. With services available in 13 cities, it is known for its distinctive orange-hued and GPS-equipped bikes.
The rapid growth is believed to heavily rely on the continuous capital investments.
Currently Mobike has raised $400 million in total, said Trustdata. In the latest round of financing, the company raised $215 million, which was led by Tencent Holdings.
The company also signed an exclusive strategic partnership with Foxconn Technology Group on Jan 23, in a move to double its annual bicycle production capacity to more than 10 million units.
Under the deal, Foxconn, the world's largest contract consumer electronics maker, will set up production lines for Mobike's bicycles, with an annual production capacity of 5.6 million units.
Wang Xiaofeng, CEO of the company, said the investment heat was in accordance with expectations as it is a China-original invention that has never been done before elsewhere in the world and the service is closely related to people's lives.

Move would help to strengthen economic ties throughout the Asia-Pacific region
China should join the Trans-Pacific Partnership as soon as possible to build closer business ties with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and further cut the possibility of trade friction, according to a report by a leading think tank.
The report, released on Thursday by the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, said that China should not be absent from the TPP after US President Donald Trump decided to withdraw from the previous 12-nation trade pact.
The report said that once in the TPP, China can improve its business integration in Asia and build better economic relations with Japan, South Korea and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Wang Xin, CCG's deputy director, said that joining the TPP will advance the realization of its vision of domestic reform.
Zhang Yunling, director of international studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: "It is possible that the US may launch a trade war with China, but it may turn into a bigger and more far-reaching trade war."
The US withdrawal from the TPP has caused other members to readjust their policies regarding whether the TPP should welcome China. Some, including Australia and Chile, have been keen in recruiting China as a TPP member to enhance the degree of integration in the Asia-Pacific region.
"Other TPP members such as Vietnam and Malaysia have also showed their desire to develop the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership as alternative to ensure their exports and factory businesses," said Zhu Feng, president of the Institute of International Studies at Nanjing University.
Zhu said the TPP membership will also be practical for China to start talks on the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific with other countries. This would be able to combine the TPP and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, to put an end to the economic fragmentation in the Asia-Pacific region that undermines economic integration,
Huo Jianguo, former president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said to meet the TPP demand, China must adopt measures to promote market-oriented reforms at home to diversify its companies' earning ability, open the market further and improve government supervision.

Wilston Shivachi is an enthusiastic user of smartphones. Like many people, the logistics consultant could not get through the day without his handset. He relies on the device to shoot selfies, stream videos on YouTube and check emails when he is out of the office.
The only thing that may surprise you is that he is in Kenya, an eastern African country. Contrary to the previous stereotype of a poverty-stricken continent fraught with political turmoil, the African market is, in fact, offering opportunities for smartphone vendors, as consumers are increasingly desirous of affordable mobile devices.
Africa's population, the fastest-growing and youngest in the world, is concentrated in urban areas. These new African consumers resemble their urban counterparts anywhere in the world: they are both brand and quality conscious, they seek out the latest trends but are budget conscious, according to a report by McKinsey & Co.
The consultancy predicted that in the next few years, 40 percent of the growth in spending power in Africa will be driven by households with an average income of more than $20,000 a year.
The trend is well reflected in local consumers' desire for affordable gadgets. Africa's smartphone users overlap significantly with its rising consumer class.
Irene Njeri, the marketing and sales manager of the Kenyan football website Futtaa, bought her first Tecno smartphone in 2013 because the handset can offer many different functions while the price is lower than other products on the market.
"Most of my friends use Tecno phones in both low and high-end segments," she said.
Njeri relies on her smartphone to perform her office work such as checking and sending emails, accessing social media sites and to make calls.
According to a survey by Jumia Kenya, a Nigerian online shopping site, Kenyans, like consumers in developed countries, are increasingly savvy and looking to get the best features for their money.
The survey which was carried out in 2015 checking the growth of smartphone market in Kenya, found that memory, battery life and the quality of the handset's camera are the top three areas that most Kenyan consumers care about when buying smartphones.
Only 44 percent of respondents said that the brand was an important consideration in buying a phone.
Also, as smartphones give more African consumers access to the internet, they are migrating to e-commerce sites to buy more affordable gadgets.
A survey released by Kenyan research firm e-Ensures in January shows that mobile phones emerged as the most popular items bought online, accounting for 58 percent of all orders. In comparison, fashion came a distant second at 18 percent.
Samsung and Tecno phones were the most popular brands with buyers, commanding more than 50 percent of the phone orders online.


China will start to collect fingerprints and capture facial images of foreign passport holders entering China at selected ports beginning on Friday to tighten border security, a source in the Ministry of Public Security said on Thursday.
Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport will be among those using the new policy before it is rolled out in other areas.
Border control authorities nationwide will fingerprint all foreign passport holders ages 14 to 70 by the end of the year. In addition to fingerprints, biometric data will also be collected, said the ministry source, who requested anonymity.
 Fingerprint collection devices have been installed at the Shenzhen airport, and signs indicating the new policy have been put up to inform foreign travelers, the source said.
People holding diplomatic passports or beneficiaries of reciprocal agreements will not be required to provide fingerprints.
The move is an important way to strengthen entry and exit control, the source said. 
Collecting and storing the fingerprints of arriving foreigners is already an international practice in many other countries, including the United States and Japan.
Authorities will ensure that the new system is efficient and does not result in unnecessary delays, the ministry said.
"Fingerprinting foreigners can significantly reduce the number of people entering China illegally with other people's passports. They may look like the pictures on the passports, but their fingerprints will never match the passport holder," said Zhang Jie, a professor at People's Public Security University who specializes in the study of exit and entry policies. 
For regular travelers, the new system will shorten the time spent at border control because their identities can be quickly confirmed based on fingerprint information stored in the system, she said.
China has been focusing on further strengthening national security, and investing in the new system is a part of it, she said, adding that people entering China illegally are likely to work illegally and even get involved in criminal activities.
Foreign passport holders exited and entered China 76.3 million times last year, an increase of 47 percent from 2015. About 14.2 million who entered gave the reason as tourism, up by 72 percent from the previous year, according to data released by the ministry on Thursday. 
Border control authorities also caught 2,705 people exiting or entering China illegally last year, the ministry said.
"I don't mind having my fingerprints collected at border control, because it is pretty common now," said Michael Gall, a UK citizen who works in Beijing.
"I just hope authorities can inform foreigners in advance and let us know when busier airports in Beijing and Shanghai will implement the new policy."

BULQIZA, Albania - Rescuers told Xinhua on Thursday that they had found one body of the three trapped Chinese miners in a chrome mine in the northern Albanian town of Bulqiza.
Two Albanian rescue teams have been sent in for the search operation, together with Albanian and Chinese mining experts, after a hydrogen gas explosion in the chrome mine on Saturday, said Mehmet Hasalami, head of the Albanian Mining Rescue Unit, earlier.
The Albanian government and the Chinese Embassy in Albania have also dispatched a working group to the mine, respectively.
The Chinese Embassy confirmed on Sunday that three other Chinese miners inflicted minor injuries in the accident.
The United States government remains committed to the one-China policy, US President Donald Trump assured his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in their first telephone call since Trump assumed office.
During the call on Friday, the two leaders also agreed to keep close contact and said they expected to meet each other at an early date, China Central Television reported.
After winning the election last year, Trump angered Beijing as he posted a tweet that seemed to question the one-China policy and he received a phone call from Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen.
After Trump took office on Jan 20, attention has been focused on the interaction between the leaders of the world's two largest economies.
In the call on Friday, Trump told Xi that he is fully aware of the great importance of the US government honoring the one-China policy.
Xi hailed Trump's assurance and said the policy forms the political bedrock for the China-US relationship.
"China is ready to work with the US to strengthen communication, expand cooperation, boost the healthy, steady development of China-US ties" to achieve greater results and benefit people of the two countries and the world, Xi said.
The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had written to Xi wishing the "Chinese people a happy Lantern Festival and a prosperous Year of the Rooster".
Trump also thanked Xi for a congratulatory letter on his election to the presidency and to express his hopes of developing "a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China".
The Lantern Festival, which falls on Saturday, is a festival celebrated on the 15th day of the first Lunar month, and many regard it as the final day of the annual Spring Festival.
When speaking to Trump on Friday, Xi congratulated Trump on assuming office as US president, and expressed appreciation for his festival greetings.
Xi spoke highly of Trump's readiness to expand two-way cooperation and develop a constructive bilateral relationship.
In return, Trump extended his appreciation and once again wished Xi and the Chinese people a happy festival.
On the two-way relationship, Xi said "the necessity and urgency is on the rise" for the two countries to reinforce cooperation, and they are fully capable of becoming a great partner for the other.
"Effectively tackling China-US ties serves the very interest of the two peoples and is an expected duty shouldered by China and the US, the two major countries, for the world," Xi said.
Beijing is willing to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with Washington in areas including economy and trade, investment, science and technology, energy, culture and infrastructure, Xi said.
Both countries are also hoped to strengthen communication and coordination in international and regional affairs to jointly champion world peace and stability, Xi added.
According to a media release by the White House, the phone call "was extremely cordial".




 
BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping said he appreciated his US counterpart, Donald Trump, for stressing that the US government adheres to the one-China policy.
Xi made the remarks in a phone conversation held Friday with Trump.
The two leaders also agreed to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in trade and economy, investment as well as international affairs.
During their first phone call since Trump's inauguration, they also agreed to keep close contact with each other, and to exchange views in a timely manner on issues of common concern.

Photos of an East Chinese village have caught the attention of Twitter-like Sina Weibo users who have marvelled at the resemblance to scenes from China's renowned painter Wu Guanzhong's artwork.
Villagers have been resettled in the new homes built on fields in the south of Dongziguang village in Tangkou town, Fuyang district in East China's Hangzhou city because there was not enough space in the existing village.
"Given there are 80 historical buildings, dated from late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in the village, the local government decided to retain the traditional look of the village while meeting residents' demand to renovate old houses," Zhang Mingcheng, who is in charge of the urban construction management office at Tangkou town, said.
Officially started in May, 2014, the buildings were completed in August, 2016. The village is reported to be planning more of the same kind of buildings in the future.

The Beijing-based company has recently faced resistance in its first US market－San Francisco, which is home to other share-economy innovations like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.
Different from other bike-share programs, Bluegogo's bikes are equipped with smart locks and GPS systems, which allow riders to locate and unlock the bikes using their smartphones and leave them at any public bike rack without locking. The service costs only 99 cents per half hour.
The company had planned to launch the program last month, but city leaders vowed to impound their bicycles and fine the company if they went ahead without permission.
City officials, who have referred to Bluegogoas a "rogue" company, were worried that the company would dump tens of thousands of bikes that would clutter public sidewalks. Bluegogo does not reveal how many bicycles it plans to deposit in the city.
At a press conference on Jan 18 supervisor Aaron Peskin, said: "Every single time, these arrogant tech companies ask later for forgiveness, or ask later for permission. This is the first time where San Francisco has gotten ahead of the curve."
Ilya Movshovich, Bluegogo's vice-president of US operations, told China Daily in an email: "We'd still really like to come to an agreement with the city regarding the use of public racks." "We last met with the city on Jan 25 and are still waiting to hear back on what permits might be needed. In the next week, we will be bringing out more bikes to be housed at our rented-out stations."

The majority of Chinese people believe that home produced products have made great progress over the past decade, according to a survey conducted by China Youth Daily.
In the survey of 2000 netizens, 65.1 percent of respondents say mobile phones were the domestic products they trust the most; 55.4 percent of them choose space and aviation facilities; and 54.1 percent place their trust in domestic high-speed rail products most.
A total of 41.4 percent of netizens praised domestic products, with 49.2 percent saying they were acceptable and only 1.3 percent of respondents rejecting made-in-China products.
Ten years ago, the most reputable domestic products were small items such as clothing and shoes. But today, high-tech products have won a good reputation for good quality and low prices.
Wu Zhen, a Doctor at Tsinghua University, said the biggest change for domestic products is that they are not only cheap, but also display advanced technologies. He noted that the smartphone he now uses is a Chinese brand, adding that the smartphone is easy to use and is of good quality.
Sun Yu working at a hospital in Henan province is planning to buy a Haier washing machine. He said many Chinese brands such as Haier, Huawei and Lenovo have won favour among foreign customers for their good quality and low prices.
To do better in the future, nearly 70 percent of respondents suggest Chinese brands focus on intellectual property rights and the development of core technology.
A total of 54.4 percent say innovation is the top priority of domestic products.

Federal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products or for the private gain of friends. The law does not apply to the president.
"Go buy Ivanka's stuff ... I'm going to go get some myself today," Conway told Fox News in an interview from the White House. "I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody."
On Wednesday, President Trump attacked department store chain Nordstrom Inc for dropping his daughter's products, drawing intense criticism for using a White House twitter platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his family's business ties.
Nordstrom said it dropped the brand for its poor performance.
Online sales of Ivanka Trump branded products fell 26 percent in January 2017 compared to the same period a year earlier, according to retail analytics firm Slice Intelligence which shared its findings with Reuters. The company analyzed data from e-mail receipts of over 4 million US online shoppers.
The data also showed sales of the Ivanka Trump brand declined in the second half of 2016 at all online retailers including Amazon.com Inc, which sells most of the brand's merchandise. In-store sales of the Ivanka Trump brand was not available.
Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight committee, told The Associated Press Conway's promotion of the brand was "clearly over the line, unacceptable."
Chaffetz spokeswoman M.J. Henshaw confirmed his comments.

ARLINGTON, Va.- When Fatima Al Ali first started playing hockey in the United Arab Emirates, she skated with young children half her size.
"They were looking up at me like, 'What is she doing here?'" she said.
On Wednesday, she was halfway around the world skating with the NHL's Washington Capitals, and they knew exactly what she was doing there. Capitals great Peter Bondra was impressed by Al Ali's advanced stickhandling moves during a visit to Abu Dhabi, and the team flew her to the United States to meet her favorite player, Alex Ovechkin, during the league's "Hockey is for Everyone" month.
The 27-year-old Al Ali only began playing hockey six years ago after falling in love with the sport as the official photographer for the men's national team, and now she's among the best players on the women's team in the United Arab Emirates. According to the International Ice Hockey Federation, the UAE has only 82 adult women's players among its 802 skaters and just nine rinks in the country of almost 6 million where the average winter temperature is about 79 degrees.
"Hockey is getting more and more popular, and Fatima is one of the key factors to this success," said Rasti Pavlikovsky, who runs the hockey camp where Bondra saw Al Ali in November. "She loves the sport, she is at the rink every day, not just skating and training, but also helping out to run the practices and games, she is also a great referee at international level."Al Ali recently got punched in the face while breaking up a fight as a referee but finished the game. She's a hockey player, all right, with skills that could probably earn her a spot on women's club team in North America.
She has had a busy week.
After visiting the National Mall and seeing sights around the nation's capital Monday with her brother, Mohammed, Al Ali took in the Wizards' overtime thriller against LeBron James and the NBA-champion Cleveland Cavaliers at night and visited the UAE embassy and met ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba on Tuesday. Overwhelmed by her first trip to Washington, she cried in the Capitals' locker room Tuesday night as she met players after their game.
She found some comfort on the ice with them Wednesday. As cameras from about a dozen media outlets documented her every stride, Al Ali talked about herself, the sport in the Middle East and stick curves and different moves.
"I was so nervous going on the ice, but once we started talking it just calmed down," she said. "We're just talking about hockey, something we all share and something we all love."On Thursday, she did the ceremonial puck drop at the Capitals-Red Wings game.
Like her country, her hockey skills are still a work in progress, but Capitals coach Barry Trotz was impressed.
"You think a lady playing hockey in (the United Arab Emirates) it doesn't sort of mix, but it's great," Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. "To see what she's doing is fantastic.
She's going to be a real role model, and I think it's a good symbol."Al Ali got a signed stick from Ovechkin to commemorate her visit. Ovechkin also hopes she takes home more motivation to play and spread the sport.
"It's good for the game, it's good for me, it's good for hockey," Ovechkin said. "I told her I hope she's going to bring more interest in the game to her country and maybe it's going to be a new league because she's got to meet some people out here."Al Ali is not from one of the countries targeted by President Donald Trump's executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim majority nations from entering the U.S. At the Capitals' suburban Washington practice facility she skated around the rink wearing a hijab and enjoying what she called the best thing to happen to her in her life.
"I'm not here for politics," Al Ali said. "I'm just here for sports and hockey."During his trip to Abu Dhabi, Bondra met with UAE hockey officials and coached an under-18 practice. He said hockey is on the way in a very nontraditional market.
"Doing a little hockey clinic, there was various stage of the level of game," Bondra said. "There was some good skaters — you could tell that they've been skating for maybe two years more or there was some kids just starting. The hockey's young there and it's growing."Al Ali is at the forefront of that on the women's side, and Pavlikovsky said nine or 10 more players from her team want to participate in their next camp run by former NHL and European players. That's the impact she hopes to have.
"That's my goal," Al Ali said. "Everything I started doing in my life I hope it inspires other people to do something and break the barrier in their culture, whatever they're doing."

PARIS - France's iconic Eiffel Tower will get a long glass wall to appear with a fresh look and improved security in a context of high terror alert, Paris city officials said on Thursday.
Speaking at press briefing, Francois Martins, Paris deputy mayor in charge of tourism, said metal fences which are currently around the Iron Lady ensure its security but "spoil the view."
Unveiling an "adequate" solution to renovate the tower and bolster security at the same time, Martins said the metal fences would be replaced by "glass panels which will allow Parisians and visitors to have a very pleasant view of the monument from the Champs de Mars and Iena bridge."
"... Our intention is to achieve a real landscaping with more fluid controls which will improve the visitors' comfort and facilitate their moving," he added.
However, the project with value remaining undetermined, still needs approvals from both a commission which preserves landmark sites of Paris and the ecology minister.
Last year, Paris city announced a 300-million-euro (320.10 million-US dollar) scheme over 15 years to mainly boost security in and around the monument as risks of terrorist attacks remain high in French capital where 130 people have been killed in a series of explosions and shooting on Nov 2015.

Guizhou has released a key development plan on its digital economy, which aims to lift the contribution made by the sector to at least 30 percent of the province's total gross domestic product by 2020, senior officials said.
The plan, the first of its kind in the country, targets expanding the utilization of information technology and big data.
To achieve the goal, Guizhou officials said the province had taken progressive moves.
"The key to drive digital economy lies in the projects," said Xu Yuanzhi, deputy head of the provincial development and reform commission.
"Last month, the commission announced 97 projects were contracted out,"Xu said.
These covered areas of the digital economy including resources, technology and services. The total investment was 65 billion yuan ($9.45 billion), Xu added.
Guizhou wants to underpin the significance of big data during the further development of its digital economy, officials said.
"Big data features heavily in the digital economy," said Ma Ningyu, deputy secretary-general of further development in Guizhou provincial government.
"The Guizhou government has listed big data as a crucial strategy, alongside poverty alleviation,"Ma added.
In 2014, the Bainiaohe Digital Town was launched with a 5 square kilometer industrial park and an information hub, focusing on internet and information technology.
More than 30 companies decided to move in, including big names such as Baidu, HTC and Legend Star.
"The investment environment is good and the local government officials have a sound and deep understanding of the digital economy and offer sufficient services," said Sheng Hua, CEO of MDong Technology, an internet company that focuses on accurate online interactive marketing.
The company moved to the digital town in 2015 and in the following year it generated 20 million yuan in revenue with a profit topping 5 million yuan.
"We plan to double staff numbers in 2017 to 200 full-time employees," Sheng said, adding that the company was now targeting 50 million yuan in revenue.
Bainiaohe Digital Town is aiming to become the home of more than 100 big data development enterprises in the next three years, providing tens of thousands of jobs and creating a 10 billion yuan worth of industry. The town also looks forward to being host to 10 listed companies.
WeWork has set up over 100 sites at 35 cities in 10 countries, by 2016
"Do What You Love" is Adam Neumann's catchphrase and no-one who has visited a location of WeWork－the world's biggest co-working space operator－can fail to be impressed by the bon mot that can be found just about everywhere in the company's public spaces to inspire the start-up entrepreneurs, freelancers and self-employed professionals who gather there to work.
On pantry mugs, writing pads in meeting rooms, on the corridor walls, "Do What You Love" is the mantra of WeWork.
WeWork is the New York City-headquartered group founded in 2010 that provides shared workspace, communities and services for entrepreneurs, freelancers, startups and small businesses.
Neumann, WeWork's co-founder and CEO, and a Isreali navy veteran, is passionate about his vision for a global community of creators－for building WeWork not just as a place for people to work in at affordable rental cost, but as a way of working and living.
The business leader almost lost his voice during his trips in Asia, particularly on the Chinese mainland, to meet investors and partners as well as "members"－the latter term replacing the more conventional one of tenants.
With the belief that the world is a better place because of "creators"－and a desire to understand the demands of those creators－Neumann and his team have turned WeWork, that began in 2010 as a small platform for co-working spaces with just one location, into a unicorn enterprise with a value exceeding $10 billion.
In China's context, the thinking behind "Do What You Love" is in alignment with the country's nationwide campaign of innovation and growing entrepreneurship, said Neumann.
This has helped power WeWork's rapid expansion in the market. In return, the co-working space operator helps improve productivity and empowers start-up entrepreneurs to reach further heights, he added.
Recently, he spoke with China Daily about the company's strategy, business opportunities and prospects. The following are the edited excerpts from the interview.
How do you see the co-working spaces market in China? Is there increasing competition as more players enter the market?
Indeed there are many types of services offering offices at affordable rental costs, such as incubators, creative-industry parks, co-working spaces, which is a good thing as long as they meet market demand.
The thing that differentiates us from the others is the networks and community we build up, which enable our members to be exposed to more business opportunities.
By the end of 2016, WeWork has set up more than 100 locations at 35 cities in 10 countries, and now nearly 10,000 companies are based at a WeWork location, with member companies ranging from start-ups to household names including Delta, IBM, KPMG, GE, Dropbox and Samsung. This creates a powerful community that other operators do not offer.
What is your plan for location launch in China market?
We will open several locations in China. In Shanghai, we will open locations in Yunan Lu, East Ocean Center (Yan'an Donglu) and Huaihai Zhong Lu very soon. In Beijing, WeWork Guanghua Lu is going to be opening in March and another location in the city will be opening by summer 2017.
Currently WeWork has two locations on the Chinese mainland, namely WeWork Yanping Lu and WeWork Weihailu. Both are located in Shanghai.
What's your view on China's startup entrepreneurs?
China's fast growth of startups, and nationwide encouragement of innovation and entrepreneurship, is a great opportunity for startups. There is so much demand yet to be met, and these are great opportunities for innovation. Of course, for WeWork it is also a great opportunity to grow in the world's second biggest economy.
What is your advice for startup entrepreneurs?
I think you really need to do what you love, and do not be afraid of making mistakes. I founded a company making babysuits for infants. It did not prove successful but I did not give up creating new business model. I learnt a lesson that in order to be successful it is key to understand market demands. You need to be passionate, brave, and understand demand to create a unique and effective business model.
What is your observation about the fast changing demand for co-working spaces?
WeWork's member demographics are changing as co-working networks expand. In fact－besides conventional startup entrepreneurs－freelancers and self-employed professionals, small businesses, artists, and divisions of large corporations have now joined the co-working network.
For example in Hong Kong, a division from HSBC is working in a WeWork location, as the employer believes that in an open, interactive environment, staff are more encouraged to be innovative and creative, which helps them to perform better and work with more well-being.
What is the core value of working in a co-working space?
The value-added services the community WeWork creates make WeWork far more than just a sublet cubicle at lower cost.
At WeWork, members are part of a global network of all the people who share resources on the same platform, which provides opportunities for letting everyone know everyone to seek collaboration opportunities.
More than 70 percent of WeWork's 90,000 members collaborate with each other and our international locations serve as convenient bases for business travel, enabling a great degree of work flexibility for both multinationals and small－to medium-size businesses alike, as well as options for easy expansion into new markets.
How do you cooperate with local partners?
Take the Beijing Guanghualu location for example. It is the first location WeWork will run in partnership with China local real estate partner Sino Ocean Group, based on a strategic cooperation agreement with a revenue share component between WeWork and SOG reached in November.
Each brings unique expertise and assets to the partnership: WeWork provides the brand, design, community, digital tools, global member network, and management operations. SOG provides the real estate, local market expertise and building-level capital. The partnership is the first of its kind for WeWork in China.
How does the globalization of China's enterprises and the Belt and Road Initiative influence WeWork's business?
The trend and the initiative creates demands that WeWork can meet. Globalization means that members need access to healthcare, payment processing, IT support, payroll management, and legal services, education, and training, and human resources in a new market.
WeWork takes care of members' multi-faceted demands, making opening a new office in a new market much easier. As I said, China is world's second largest economy and entrepreneurship, innovation and creators are all growing. We want to be a part of it.
How do you describe your leadership style?
I believe that people achieve more together than they can on their own. My team and I want to grow WeWork everywhere to serve everyone, expanding globally and focusing on building technology that connects members around the world so they are empowered to do what they love.
What is your take on balancing work and life?
I have four children and a lovely wife, and for me family is very important. At WeWork, our mission is to create a world where people work to make a life, not just a living.
An entrepreneur and a co-working space operator who provides services to entrepreneurs, I have always looked at more areas that WeWork can take care of－such as members' well-being after work.
In new locations, facilities such as a yoga room and fitness room are added alongside a nursery room and shower room, giving members comfortable spaces to relax, entertain, and have quality time with children and family.

Dubai's Multi Commodities Center, the largest free trade zone in the United Arab Emirates, has seen a strong surge in the number of Chinese companies as the Belt and Road Initiative drives new business opportunities.
Registrations of Chinese companies at the DMCC have grown by an average of 46 percent annually over the past five years.
"The number of Chinese companies setting up in Dubai and DMCC is on the rise," said Chief Executive Officer Gautam Sashittal. "But it is still a small portion of our 13,500 registered companies in total".
Located in the middle of the Maritime Silk Road, the zone has attracted around 150 Chinese companies since its establishment in 2002.
The majority of Chinese companies already there are large corporates involved in infrastructure and technology, including Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Hisense Group, Sinopec Group, China Harbour Engineering Co and China State Construction Engineering Corp.
He said he believes the Belt and Road Initiative will drive the growth even more rapidly and provide new opportunities for small and medium-sized companies and startups in the trading and services sectors.
"With the increased digitalization of trade, international commerce will grow by $29 trillion over the next decade, bringing about 350 million new businesses into international trade," he said. "And that's where we are keen to grow trade relationships."
On Monday, a DMCC delegation visited Shenzhen, home of 1.4 million SMEs in Guangdong province, for the first time. "We are here because it is the hub for technology and new innovations," he explained.
In addition, the DMCC plans to build a new coffee center which is expected to export around 140,000 metric tons of Chinese Arabica beans from Yunnan province to Dubai and then re-export them globally.
Cong Hongbin, vice-chairman of international relations at strategic advisory company Falcon and Associates, said the petroleum and natural gas industry accounts for about just 2 percent of Dubai's GDP, while the majority comes from the service sector, such as trade, logistics and tourism.
He said the city not only can benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative but also is an ideal pivot to support its development.

An 85-year-old granny in the Eastern Chinese city of Xiamen in Fujian province has caused an online sensation for her unusual, positive attitude towards life despite experiencing many difficulties, local media reported.
Zheng Suzhen, born in 1933 to a poor family, still likes riding the merry-go-round, not with her peers, but with her great-granddaughter.
Zheng lost her father at age 9 and received no education. From an early age, and to support her family, she tried her hand at all kinds of labor-intensive work usually reserved for men, ranging from raising pigs to farming and fishing.
At 40 years old and with her husband having passed away, she had to raise seven children by herself.
Though her children competed to invite her to live with them, Zheng prefers to live by herself and says she is still young enough to try new things. She had her eyebrows trimmed and bought facial masks after seeing they are part of life for young women.
At 80 years old, she travelled alone to Hong Kong. Two years later, she visited Taiwan by herself, taking a ship and various flights. To make her family members feel at ease, she lied that she was traveling with a group.
She now keeps a good routine every day, starting her morning with exercise and drinking tea. Sometimes she takes a bus for four hours to buy her favorite wine, making six stops on the journey.
Her curiosity about life and passion for exploring new possibilities have inspired many online.

MADRID - Spain receives average 1 million international tourists, who traveled to the country mainly to play golf, each year, according to a report by Golf Business Partners.
The report titled "The impact of golf on Spain" ranked Spain as the world's second in terms of the number of arrivals for this purpose, only surpassed by the United States.
"Spain is a leading country in terms of tourism and regarding golf it is the same," Jose Miragalla, responsible for marketing at the Royal Spanish Golf Federation, told Xinhua in an interview on the occasion of UNIGOLF, a fair dedicated to golf held in Madrid.
"The quality of service and infrastructure at a national level, along with the good weather, it is key, then culture and gastronomy are also important. I think it is an ideal country to receive any kind of tourist," he said.
According to the report, in 2016 there were 272,280 Spanish citizens affiliated to the Federation, but the figure topped 1 million when foreigners are included.
The activity generates around 400 million euros every year with people spending average a week in four and five-star hotels.
The sector highlights that this kind of tourism is very good for the country, making great contributions to the gross domestic product. According to the report, they spend 74.8 percent more than other tourists due to their high purchasing power with a daily spending of 171.4 euros (183.9 U.S. dollars).
Playing golf means social gatherings that go from spending time with family and friends to business meetings, explained Miragalla.
"It is true that many CEOs play golf and instead of having a formal meeting at the office they go to play golf and having a more relaxing meeting and build networking in a different way," said Miragalla.
Spain is promoting the sport among the public through public golf courses and golf at schools.
"Spain is boosting public golf courses, trying also to make golf closer to cities, so that people who live in the cities do not have to travel a long distance to practice," said Miragalla.
"The Spanish Federation is promoting golf at schools as part of the subject of physical education. Children from every kind of school, private or public, can have the opportunity of playing golf for the first time," he added.
There are a total of 359 golf courses in Spain, plus 21 rustics and 95 Pitch&Putts and schools.
Spain received 75.6 million international tourists in 2016, hitting a new record high and being one of the most visited destinations in the world.
It ranked first in both 2015 and 2016 in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum, which highlighted the good infrastructures, cultural resources and adaptation to new technologies.

BUCHAREST, Romania — Serena Williams has spoken out in response to suspended Fed Cup captain Ilie Nastase's comments speculating about the skin color of the baby the pregnant Williams is expecting.
The 23-time major champion wrote on Instagram on Monday: "It disappoints me to know we live in a society where people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments towards myself and (my) unborn child."Williams is black. Her fiance, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, is white.
Williams also referred to Nastase's "sexist comments against my peers" — a reference to his verbal abuse directed at British player Johanna Konta, British captain Anne Keothavong and the chair umpire during Fed Cup matches over the weekend. He was ejected from the Romania vs. Britain contest and provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation.
Williams said: "I humbly thank the ITF for any consideration given to all the facts in this case. They will have my full support."She also wrote: "I have said it once and I'll say it again, this world has come so far but yet we have so much further to go. Yes, we have broken down so many barriers- however there are a plethora more to go. This or anything else will not stop me from pouring love, light and positivity into everything that I do. I will continue to take a lead and stand up for what's right."
Nastase, for his part, was unrepentant, saying that he didn't believe his remarks at a news conference Friday about Williams' baby were racist.
"I want to know what word I used is racist?" he said Monday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from Budapest, Hungary.
He added that he is a friend of Williams.
As for what happened during the matches against Britain, Nastase acknowledged: "Yes, I lost my temper."But he called his punishment "crazy."Nastase earned the nickname "Nasty" for his on-court outbursts and gamesmanship in his playing heyday in the 1970s. But it also described his game, which earned him two Grand Slam singles titles and more than 100 ATP titles. He's a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.
Reactions in Romania to Nastase's outburst have been mixed.
George Cosac, the chairman of the Romanian Tennis Federation, defended Nastase by suggesting he was picked on by the British officials. Ion Tiriac, a businessman and Nastase's old doubles partner, also stood by him, criticizing Konta for walking off the court.
However, many Romanians were critical of Nastase on social media, saying he embarrassed himself and Romania.

But the poster girl of women's tennis isn't being welcomed back with open arms by rivals who were already suspicious of the towering Russian's ice-cold detachment even before her fall from grace.
Sharapova isn't losing any sleep over that, as the 30-year-old prepares for her first match since losing to Serena Williams in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Australian Open.
"That is the least of my concerns. I know that I am respected in my field," said Sharapova who was controversially handed a wild card into this week's Stuttgart event, a clay-court tournament sponsored by Porsche, one of her headline backers.
"I see the respect in how my opponents play against me."
She has been given a Wednesday start - the day her ban, imposed for testing positive for meldonium at last year's Australian Open - comes to an end.
Sharapova, who opens against Italian veteran Roberta Vinci, had been taking the over-the-counter cardiac supplement when it was within the rules, but was later reclassified as a prohibited drug.
Far from being remorseful, Sharapova recently challenged tennis authorities for failing to give her sufficient warning that meldonium had become a banned substance.
The Russian could not have picked a better tournament for her return, having won the Stuttgart title three times, against just one defeat.
If she gets through her opener, she could face Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, one of her fiercest critics, in the second round.
Radwanska, the sixth-seed in Stuttgart, expects an intense return from the Russian, but said Sharapova should have had to qualify on merit rather than being given a free pass on a wild card.
'Journeymen' rivals
"This kind of entry into the tournament should apply to players who dropped in the ranking because of injury, illness or some other random event. Not for those suspended for doping," said Radwanska.
Sharapova's agent, Max Eisenbud, said his client's rivals are motivated solely by jealousy - especially with Sharapova also battling for a French Open wild card.
"All those journeymen players like Radwanska and Caroline Wozniacki who have never won a Grand Slam, and the next generation passing them ... they are smart to try to keep Maria out of Paris," Eisenbud said.
"No Serena, no Maria, no Vika, no Petra; it's their last chance to win a slam," he added, a nod to the absence of pregnant Serena Williams, Petra Kvitova and Victoria Azarenka - the latter two expected to return in July.
Sharapova can expect plenty of support from the Stuttgart organizers as her return is the highlight in the tournament's 40th anniversary celebrations.
As an ambassador for Porsche, she is sure of a warm welcome. Her confectionary brand - Sugarpova - will have a stand in the tournament's retail village, and tournament director Markus Guenthardt knows her presence will boost ticket sales.
"Her return in the Porsche Arena is a fabulous present for our fantastic spectators and is certain to be one of the sporting and emotional highlights of our anniversary tournament," he said.
As well as Radwanska, many of Sharapova's other potential Stuttgart rivals have made it clear they disapprove of her getting a helping hand into the main draw.
Germany's Angelique Kerber, this year's top seed and the only player to have beaten Sharapova in Stuttgart, said her place should have gone to local talent.
"It's a German tournament, and we have so many good German players, so this is also a little bit strange," said Kerber.
"It's also strange for the players that she will walk on site on Wednesday and play on the same day."
Dominika Cibulkova, the third seed, claims Sharapova is benefiting from unfair treatment.
"It's not about her, but everyone who was doping should start from zero," said the Slovakian.

SEOUL - A US nuclear-powered submarine on Tuesday arrived at the southern port of Busan, South Korea, amid tensions on the Korean Peninsula, YTN television reported.
The USS Michigan guided-missile submarine has already arrived at Busan, the South Korean military was quoted as saying. The broadcaster did not elaborate on the exact time of its arrival.
Although the nuclear submarine is not supposed to participate in any drills or military operations, its call would send a meaningful message to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), said the YTN.
At a national meeting held Monday, the DPRK again warned the United States that it would stage preemptive nuclear strikes against American forces.
The USS Michigan is one of four Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines loaded with nuclear missiles. The 170-meter-long, 18,000-ton submarine can carry as many as 150 Tomahawk cruise missiles with a range of some 1,600 km.
The Michigan's call on South Korea came amid mounting tensions on the peninsula. The USS Carl Vinson nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is sailing toward the peninsula.
The rare re-routing of the super-carrier to the peninsula had raised concerns about possible airstrikes on the DPRK's nuclear facilities.
Meanwhile, the DPRK Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the Korean Peninsula is on the verge of war due to "reckless action" by the United States using both economic sanctions and increasing military threats.
According to South Korea's military, the DPRK conducted large-scale live-fire artillery exercises on Tuesday to mark its army anniversary.
The DPRK's artillery drills came amid ongoing joint military exercises of South Korea and the United States.
The US-South Korea joint war games, which were denounced by the DPRK as a rehearsal for northward invasion, would last till the end of this month.

Chinese spiker Zhu Ting clinched her first title after joining Turkish team Vakif-Bank in a 25-19, 25-13, 25-23 victory over Italy's Conegliano in the women's volleyball Champions League final in Treviso, Italy, on Sunday.
With 22 points in the final, including 19 in attack and 3 in block, Zhu was named the match's most valuable player, the league's first Chinese player to win the designation. It was the team's third Champions League trophy after 2011 and 2013.
"This year we were down so many times, but our players never gave up. I'm really proud of these players," said VakifBank's head coach, Giovanni Guidetti.
At Saturday's semifinals, Zhu claimed 24 points to lift the team into the final, beating Turkey's Eczacibasi 3-0.
The Champions League trophy is the first for Zhu while playing overseas.
Zhu, 22, signed with Vakif-Bank in October after helping China win gold in women's volleyball at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.
After Zhu joined, VakifBank won 17 games in the Turkish league, ranking first in the regular season. In the playoffs, the team was edged out and had to compete for third place in the national league.
Zhu showed great promise in volleyball from an early age. She helped China's national youth team win the Asian Youth Women's Championships in 2012 and 2013. She was MVP at the 2012 championship and best scorer, best spike and MVP at the 2013 championship.
After her joining the national team in 2013, she won best spike at the 2013 World Grand Prix Finals and best scorer and best spike at the 2014 World Championships.
At the Rio Olympics, Zhu had 170 points as leading spiker of the Chinese team and was named Olympic MVP in women's volleyball. In January, she was named CCTV Sports woman of the Year.

Chinese cue master Ding Junhui faces a firecracker of a quarterfinal against Ronnie "the Rocket" O'Sullivan on Tuesday as the Jiangsu province native continues his quest for a first World Snooker Championship title in Sheffield, UK.
Ding showed some impressive form on Saturday as he booked his place in the last eight, showing nerves of steel to come back from 12-11 down against compatriot Liang Wenbo to win a thrilling epic of a tie 13-12.
But if the world number four is to finally achieve his dream of becoming China's first ever world snooker champion, he will need to hit new heights of form in his clash against O'Sullivan.
The mercurial five-time champion is regarded by many as the most naturally gifted player of all time and is a personal hero of Ding, whom he has beaten in 10 of their 13 previous meetings.
"The Rocket" has been misfiring for much of the season and arrived in Sheffield ranked eight places below his Chinese opponent, but since the start of the tournament he has appeared laser-focused. The Englishman looked back to his best as he overcame former champion Shaun Murphy 13-7 in the second round.
Ding agrees that O'Sullivan will be the favorite going into the tie, but he is determined not to be intimidated by the 41-year-old's reputation.
"I have faced Ronnie in a few tournaments, but this time I want to show my best snooker. The reason I practise is because I want to play my best snooker against my heroes. I want to see how I can do, test myself and find out how good I am," said Ding.
Though he has not beaten O'Sullivan in a ranking event since 2006, many believe the Chinese star is better prepared to withstand "the Rocket" than ever before.
ONBOARD SHIP XIANGYANGHONG 09 -- Chinese scientists embarked on a deep-sea mission in the South China Sea on Tuesday, the beginning of the second stage of China's 38th oceanic expedition.
China's manned submersible Jiaolong with her crew of scientists arrived in the location aboard the mother ship Xiangyanghong 09 on Tuesday.
The submersible is expected to conduct its first South China Sea dive this year on Wednesday if the weather conditions allow, according to Wu Changbin, general commander of the second stage of the expedition.
During the mission, which lasts until May 13, scientists hope to choose a site for experimenting the collection of polymetallic nodules and complete geological and biological surveys.
The 38th oceanic scientific expedition started on Feb 6. Jiaolong completed a dive in the northwestern Indian Ocean earlier this year in the mission's first stage. It will also conduct surveys in the Yap Trench and the Mariana Trench in the third stage.
Named after a mythical dragon, Jiaolong reached its deepest depth of 7,062 meters in the Mariana Trench in June 2012.

A stable outlook is expected in the Chinese mainland property market in the coming 6 to 12 months but going forward developers face a challenging operating environment, Moody's Investors Service said in a report.
Moody's said the challenging operating environment is manifesting itself nationally in a slight drop in home sales values, tighter regulatory measures, rising home inventory levels and a gradual tightening of market liquidity.
"The stable outlook reflects our expectation that national residential property sales will slow but will remain within our parameters," said Franco Leung Chun-bong, vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody's.
The US credit rating agency expected nationwide that contracted sales value growth would be slightly negative through May this year against the soaring 36 percent year-on-year growth registered for the same month in 2016.
Residential property sales volumes will contract and home prices will slow, as the Chinese government continued its tightening regulatory measures in major Chinese cities, Moody's added.
"We also expect the Chinese government to keep in place the tight regulatory measures designed to cool prices in higher-tier cities," Leung added.
As of April 21, 45 Chinese mainland cities had home-purchase restrictions in place to curb speculative investment demand and these locations accounted for around 50 percent of the country's contracted home sales in 2016, the credit rating agency noted.
The third factor to gauge is the home inventory level, Moody's said.
The Moody's survey found that the current inventory levels of primary residential properties were below the peak levels in early 2015.
But the survey also revealed inventory levels in March rose for first and second-tiered cities, indicating houses were selling more slowly as supply outpaced demand.
Moody's said the final challenging market factor was the gradual tightening of market liquidity, even though current monetary conditions were broadly more supportive than in early 2014.
It said this was due to slowing home sales and the dramatic slowdown seen in onshore bond issuance since early 2017.
Small-scale developers with weak credit profiles were expected to be hard-hit, the rating agency said, as they continued to face pressure to sell off their assets to competitors or were acquired by stronger industry players.
The reserve requirement rate and one-year benchmark lending rate set by the People's Bank of China, as at April 2014, are 17 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. The two ratios are currently lower than the figures recorded in January 2014.
According to Moody's data, rated Chinese developers in total issued 8 onshore bonds totaling 15.8 billion yuan ($2.29 billion) in the first quarter of this year, compared with 41 onshore bonds totaling 116 billion yuan a year ago.
Against the backdrop of the challenging operating environment, Moody's said it anticipated that market competition would continue to intensify as many developers continued to target high sales growth in the current year to capture additional market share－in the process pushing up land prices and squeezing profit margins.
However, the US-based credit rating agency cautioned that the stable outlook for Chinese residential property market may be downgraded to a negative.
It said that scenario could be played out if national contracted home sales fall more than 5 to 10 percent, home inventory levels reach the peak levels of March 2015－or there is an interruption to developers' access to funding or a material tightening of bank liquidity and mortgage availability.

BURNLEY, England - Jose Mourinho said it will be "really hard" for veteran striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to recover from his season-ending knee ligament injury.
The Manchester United manager was speaking after his side's impressive 2-0 victory at Burnley, three days after Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo sustained knee injuries, which require surgery, during last week's Europa League quarterfinal win over Anderlecht.
"Everyone is very sad. We were thinking about them. They have to be strong," Mourinho said on Sunday.
"Unfortunately they won't be the first or last players to get an important injury.
"No player deserves to be injured, but I think in this case it's even more sad because for Zlatan, in this stage of his career, it's really, really hard.
"And Marcos at this moment in his career is playing very well for us and also finally getting a position as central defender in the Argentina team, so we're really sad for them."
Reports have suggested that, given his age, Ibrahimovic might not play at the top level again.
The 35-year-old's United contract expires at the end of the season, although Mourinho would not be drawn into speculation over the forward's future.
"I think it's for the medical department to be more specific and to evaluate over the next few days to seek an expert's opinion and we have to wait and see about that," he said.
"I don't care about it in this moment, I just want the player to recover the best he can and we'll see about it.
"Honestly, I'm not sad for the team, I'm not worried about the impact of not having them. I don't care about it, I just think about them, and like everybody I'm really sad."
Goals from Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney earned United's win at Burnley, with the former responding well to midweek comments from his manager that questioned his work ethic.
"Yes," said Mourinho when asked if Martial had responded as he wished.
"Of course, it was a very good performance by him - with the ball, without the ball, in defense, matched in the middle against two strong central defenders and without anyone just behind him supporting him."

Editor's Note:
As the latest addition to China's Free Trade Zones project, Chongqing plans to become a pivot in the country's go-west campaign－the national effort to develop the vast western regions, home to energy and mineral resources crucial to its future growth.
The central government announced the launch of the China (Chongqing) Pilot Free Trade Zone on April 1. The third batch of FTZs includes Chongqing municipality, Henan, Hubei, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces.
The total number of FTZs has reached 11 after the first FTZ (Shanghai) opened for business in 2013.
Chongqing FTZ, spanning about 120 square kilometers, comprises three parts－Liangjiang New Area, Xiyong area and Guoyuan Port area.
According to the FTZ blueprint, Chongqing will build itself into a pilot zone of inland free trade featuring a convenient investment and trade environment, efficient supervision, complete finance services as well as a sound legal environment for business.
In addition to practices and policies common to all the FTZs, "Chongqing will speed up the construction of a comprehensive international logistics system based on the current Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe intercontinental railway," said Vice-Mayor Liu Guiping at the press conference of the launch of the Chongqing FTZ.
"We are going to explore strategies and policies to support the Belt and Road Initiative and find out how to make land trade rules."
In three years, Chongqing FTZ will become the center of international logistics, inland services trade and inland finance, Liu said.
As the only municipality in western China, the traditional industrial hub, located at the intersection of the Belt and Road Initiative's trade route and the Yangtze River Economic Zone, has witnessed fast and steady economic growth in recent years and led the country's GDP growth rate table for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015.

Thanks to its comprehensive transportation system spanning air, water and land, the city of 30 million people is also one of the nine key logistics centers in the country.
Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport is one of the eight major airline hubs in China. An ongoing expansion project will increase its annual throughput of passengers to 45 million.
Guoyuan Port, which is linked with the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe International Railway, has 16 berths and can handle 6 million metric tons of bulk cargo annually. Coal and iron ores from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Gansu province are transferred at the port.
Goods from neighboring provinces and countries are transported to Shapingba Tuanjiecun railway terminal and sent to Central Asia and Europe.
Last year, the city was picked as the operational center of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity, the third intergovernmental project between the two countries. The initiative will pilot cooperation in fields ranging from financial services, aviation, transportation and logistics to information communications technology.
Liangjing New Area will play a key role in Chongqing FTZ as it covers most of the FTZ area and functions. The operational center for Sino-Singapore (Chongqing) project is also located in the new area.
Established in 2010, Liangjiang is the third national development and opening zone in China－and the first in the inland－approved by the State Council, after Shanghai Pudong New Area and Tianjin Binhai New Area.
"We should combine the Sino-Singapore program with the FTZ project so that we can achieve the real free flow in trade, human resources and commodities," said Tang Zongwei, deputy director of the Liangjiang New Area Administrative Committee.
Many foreign companies have already entered Chongqing to expand their presence in China's inland.
Cui Wei, regional director of West China at Prologis, the world's second-largest logistic company, has recently signed an agreement with Chongqing Logistics Park located in the FTZ to build a logistics center for the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe intercontinental railway.
"The FTZ will be more open in many areas, such as capital and talent flow, and our company will surely benefit from that," he said.
A Chinese man and his daughter were sentenced Monday in Los Angeles for an immigration fraud scheme in which Chinese nationals paid tens of thousands of dollars to be "married" to US citizens.
Jason Shiao, 67, also known as "Zheng Yi Xiao," posed as an attorney and was sentenced to two years. His daughter Lynn Leung, 45, was sentenced last week to six months in prison.
The father operated the Pasadena, California-based Jason (USA) International Law Corp. He falsely claimed to be an attorney, paid US citizens thousands of dollars to participate in the scheme and introduced immigrants seeking lawful permanent residency to US citizens to facilitate the sham marriages.
The daughter lined up US citizen "spouses" for their clients, coached the couples on how to make the marriages appear genuine when questioned by immigration authorities, prepared and filed immigration petitions, and created fraudulent paper trails for the "couples" - including phony apartment leases, wedding photos, bank statements and income tax returns.
According to court documents, Chinese nationals paid up to $50,000 to enter into sham marriages with the hope of obtaining lawful permanent-resident cards. At least 87 foreign nationals, mostly Chinese, were involved in the scheme.
The pair were arrested in September 2015. In January, Shiao pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and marriage fraud. Leung also pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge.
A third defendant charged in the case, Shannon Mendoza, 50, was transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where he also is being prosecuted on drug-trafficking charges based on conduct allegedly committed while on pre-trial release in the immigration fraud case.
He acted as a recruiter by finding US citizens who were willing to enter into sham marriages in exchange for payments of up to $15,000. Mendoza sought out prospective US citizen "spouses" who were in dire financial straits and then arranged for them to meet Shiao and Leung.
Court documents describe how the defendants went to considerable lengths to make the fake marriages appear real. According to Shiao's plea agreement, he and his daughter prepared documentation that was filed with USCIS to bolster the validity of the fraudulent marriages, including staged photographs of "wedding ceremonies" and bogus tax returns, life insurance policies, joint bank account information and apartment-lease applications.
The investigation in this case began in September 2012, based on information provided by an anonymous caller who contacted US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
This case was the result of an undercover investigation by the Los Angeles Document and Benefit Fraud Task Force, which began in September 2012, based on an anonymous tip.

TCL Corp Chairman Li Dongsheng said the Chinese electronics giant is in the final stages of making an investment in a US technology company that would be worth as much as $300 million and urged President Donald Trump's administration to allow him to seal the deal.
Li said in a Bloomberg Television interview that he expected approval for a separate US deal in November, but since then it has dragged on, without specifying the target company.
"I can't say what it was because until now the US government still has not approved it, there has been no formal response," Li said. "This is unreasonable."
TCL, which makes and sells BlackBerrys around the world, is seeking to transform itself from a big player in China's devices market to a global technology powerhouse by building and buying makers of key device parts such as touch screens and computing chips. Li said he wants TCL to be the world's biggest television producer within five to 10 years and to make advanced organic LED screens for Apple Inc iPhones.
"Next month I'm sending a team to Israel and we hope to finalize some investments there," Li said at a conference in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. He said TCL has invested almost 150 billion yuan ($22 billion) in building display manufacturing facilities.
Li said the smartphone and television performance has been flat or weaker over the past year amid heavy competition from domestic smartphone brands like oppo and vivo. The company won't spin off the smartphone unit because it's a core part of the business, but it will likely go through a major restructuring this year, he said. TCL's smartphone shipments fell 39 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to the unit responsible for phone sales. The same subsidiary also builds BlackBerry and Alcatel phones, two brands hit by fading appeal.
Li said TCL wants to supply Apple with smartphone components including OLED screens but hasn't had talks with the company.
"Apple likes to use suppliers who have been successfully operating for two or three years before they bring them on board," Li said. "At the moment we're mostly supplying Huawei and we're also supplying oppo."

Dave Jones, president of SPD Silicon Valley Bank.
SPD Silicon Valley Bank plans to open a branch in Shenzhen in the summer of 2018, another big step in its robust expansion in China.
The Shanghai-headquartered bank opened its Beijing branch in February and signed a memorandum with the Shenzhen government on Thursday on the establishment of a branch in the city, a technology and innovation hub.
SSVB will invest 100 million yuan ($14.52 million) as the startup capital for its Shenzhen branch and support its "solid growth" with additional capital, according to Dave Jones, the bank's president.
"Our target customers are venture capital-backed innovation companies," Jones said during the 2017 China (Guangdong)-US Investment Cooperation Conference in Guangzhou, the provincial capital, on Thursday.
Jones emphasized that right now the Chinese mainland has its "almost 100 percent concentration", although the Silicon Valley Bank seeks Singapore as a potential second location in Asia.
SSVB is a joint venture between Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co Ltd and US-based Silicon Valley Bank. It was founded in 2012 as China's first commercial bank dedicated to technology and innovation startups.
It introduced renminbi business to its Chinese customers in September 2015 and was selected in April last year as one of the three pilots in Shanghai for trials of an investment-loan linkage mechanism to help small and medium-sized technology companies.
"We go where venture capitals goes," Jones said. "If you look at the historical venture capital investments, 40 percent of them went to Beijing, 20 percent to Shanghai and 20 percent to Shenzhen. Clearly we have to have a Shenzhen branch."
The bank president pointed to e-commerce, life sciences and all things mobile－from drones to electric vehicles－as some of the hottest areas where venture capital is going today.
Shenzhen, the headquarters of telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and internet major Tencent Holdings Ltd, is also home to numerous tech startups, which have huge demand for funding.
The city also takes the core role in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, an area that Pony Ma, chairman and CEO of Tencent, described as "the cradle of the Chinese Silicon Valley".
"I think it (the Greater Bay Area) is definitely possible to become the cradle of a Chinese Silicon Valley," Jones said. "What is required is the willingness to think differently from both companies and the government."
"The vision will be realized if the government maintains a dialogue with the entrepreneurial and innovation community and is willing to be innovative about taxes and offer better financial rewards to attract talent from other cities," he said.

Shenzhen-based smartphone maker Gionee unveiled a six-inch screen handset in Beijing on Monday, reinforcing its edge in security functions.
Dubbed the M6S Plus, the handset is equipped with built-in security encryption chips and EAL4 + security certification. The fingerprint sensor, which is able to record the user's heart rate, guarantees security of users' privacy and personal data.
Another feature of the new product is the large battery with a capacity of 6020mAh, with support from Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 standard.
Powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 653 octa-core processor, Gionee M6S Plus has 6GB RAM and dual shooters, a 12-megapixel rear camera and an eight-megapixel camera in the front.
The Gionee M6S Plus 64GB model is priced at 3,499 yuan and the 256 GB model at 4,299 yuan.
The new product will be available on May 2.
A report from US telecom research company Strategy Analytics said that Gionee is among the top smartphone brands in China and is ranked in the top 10 worldwide, with 30 million handsets sold last year.
Gionee saw solid growth in 2016 due to its expansion in the offline channel in the lower tier cities, according a report from market research company IDC.
"To differentiate itself from OPPO and vivo, who predominantly target a younger audience, Gionee has been targeting professionals and executives, and hence found a niche market for itself to stand out against its two competitors," the IDC report said.
Hesteel Serbia employees discuss production techniques with a member of the Chinese management team. Fu Jing / China Daily




For 20 years, Svetlana Radosavljevic has monitored the manufacture of steel and iron from a glass-walled control room in an old production center at Zelezara Smederevo, Serbia's biggest mill.
For many years, the mill, less than a 60-minute drive from Belgrade, could only run one of its two production lines, and it lost about $10 million a month. Moreover, many of the 5,000 workers were unproductive. These factors resulted in a prolonged period of low productivity that almost forced the company into bankruptcy.
Last year, the 105-year-old mill was given a new lease on life, when Hesteel Group, from Hebei province, purchased it for 46 million euros ($49.6 million).
Now, both production lines are running at full capacity at Hesteel Serbia, the mill's new name, which will see production of 2 million metric tons this year, the maximum of a quota agreed between the European Union and Serbia. The acquisition ended seven years of losses, and by the end of last year, the mill was profitable again.
The workers are now more confident because their jobs are secure, and wages have risen by an average of 8 percent, compared with the pre-takeover level.
"Now it is safer, production is higher, and I am more focused on my job because I don't need to worry about becoming unemployed," Radosavljevic said.
Her control room is about 50 meters from the end of a line that produces steel plate. During a visit in June, President Xi Jinping spoke with the workers and management in the control room, which helped to inject the confidence needed to make the most of the lifeline offered by the acquisition.
In addition to the frontline workers, even Serbia's Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, who is also president-elect, is excited about the performance.
Song Sihai, an executive board member of Hesteel Serbia who oversees management of the mill, described his meeting with Vucic. "The prime minister and I discussed the revenue target for this year, which will be about $800 million, and he asked his assistant to calculate the amount it would contribute to the country's economic output," he said.
Sitting in his office, Song, an executive with the parent company, quoted Vucic's conclusion, that the company's revenues will account for more than 2 percent of GDP this year.
"Surely, this will provide great help to Serbia's economic development," he said.

Drone manufacturer DJI Innovation Technology Co and Qianxun Spatial Intelligence Inc, a company that uses China's homegrown BeiDou Navigation Satellite System for location and data analysis services, have announced a strategic partnership to promote the application of the navigation system in the drone industry.
The partners are bullish about the prospects for drones, especially agricultural models, used to spray pesticide, and say that BeiDou's highly accurate positioning service is one of its major advantages, especially in agriculture.
Cao Nan, vice-president of DJI, said: "There is still a lot of room for the two sides to cooperate in more fields, including inspection, public safety and mapping."
Cao added the cooperation will make agricultural drone users enjoy a stable, reliable and high-accuracy service. Moreover, the two companies will work together to explore the standard operating mode of agricultural drones.
Qianxun is a joint venture established by China North Industries Group Corp, the largest defense equipment manufacturer in the country and e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2015, with registered capital of 2 billion yuan ($290 million), to help develop BeiDou.
Chen Jinpei, CEO of Qianxun, said it will continue to promote the construction of the BeiDou ground base enhancement network, and provide a commercial high-accuracy location and data analysis service in the fields of automobiles, bike sharing, mobile phones and drones.
Shenzhen-based DJI launched the RTK (real-time kinematic) version of the agricultural drone MG-1S, which can perform the high-accuracy positioning of farmland and pesticide spraying through access to the service provided by Qianxun.
The RTK service network covers 18 provinces and municipalities, and will expand to the whole country in the future. Priced at 23,000 yuan, the RTK version of MG-1S is expected to start shipping in the second quarter of this year.
DJI, claiming to account for 70 percent of the global consumer drone market, is devoting a great deal of attention to industry-level drones.
In November, it launched an upgraded agricultural drone, the MG-1S, which is equipped with an advanced flight control system, radar and sensors.
"Industry-level drones have a higher demand for technologies, and in turn, the applications in industries encourage drone manufacturers to improve their technological levels," said Pan Xuefei, a senior analyst at market research firm International Data Corp.
Pan said high-accuracy positioning is an important function for drones, and there are broad prospects for its application.
People look out towards the ocean on Cerro Castillo hill, after a mass evacuation of the entire coastline during a tsunami alert after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit off the coast in Vina del Mar, Chile April 24, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]
The quake was centered about 85 miles (137 km) from Santiago, and some 22 miles (35 km) west of the coastal city of Valparaiso. The U.S. Geological Survey twice revised the magnitude before settling on 6.9, a strength usually capable of causing severe damage.
The epicenter's shallow depth of 15.5 miles (25 km) below the sea allowed it to be felt hundreds of miles (km) away. Santiago office buildings swayed for about 30 seconds at the end of the workday.
Closer to the epicenter, residents scrambled for higher ground, remembering the lessons of the country's devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2010.
"It was short but very powerful," said Paloma Salamo, a 26-year-old nurse, who was in a clinic just north of Valparaiso, when the quake struck.
People ran from the facility carrying children and some headed for the hills when the tsunami alarm sounded, she said, but calm was soon restored.
"So far there has been no human loss nor significant damage," President Michelle Bachelet said, praising people for evacuating in an orderly fashion in the immediate aftermath.
Officials canceled a tsunami warning that had been issued in Valparaiso. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported small tsunami waves of half a foot (15 cm).
There were no reports of structural damage in Valparaiso, but cellphone networks were down in some places, a spokesman with the local government said.

Liu Wenbo made history on Saturday when the 16-year-old Chinese amateur won the Zhangjiagang Shuangshan Challenge to become the youngest winner on the China LPGA Tour.
The Beijing teenager, who closed with a two-under-par 70 to finish on even-par 216, accomplished the feat in dramatic fashion in beating Thailand's Kanyalak Preedasuttijit (73) with a par on the first hole of a play-off at Shuangshan Golf Course.
"An unexpected win. My goal was to win this year, but I didn't think it would happen so quick, so fast. I am really happy now," she said.
Liu, age 16 years, two months and 11 days, became the fourth amateur to win on Tour. She bettered the previous record for youngest winner set by Wang Ziyi who captured the 2014 Xiamen Challenge at age 16 years, five months and two days.
China's Li Jiayun (71) was equal third, tied with Chen Yu-Ju (69) and Thailand's Saranporn Langkulgasettrin (71). Overnight co-leader Kuo Ai-chen (75) was equal sixth with Thai Parinda Phokan (74).

NEW YORK - China's non-performing loans have stabilized and pressure from capital flight has eased off, Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said here on Monday.
Yi made the remarks at the International Finance and Infrastructure Forum in New York. While acknowledging that China's financial market still faces different types of risks, he said that "the overall risk is under control."
"Non-performing loans are getting pretty much stabilized after a long time of climbing," said Yi.
China's non-performing ratio declined in the fourth quarter of 2016, the first time since 2012, suggesting that the loan losses that have posed risks to the country's financial market are finally easing. At the end of 2016, lenders saw the ratio of their non-performing loans fall to 1.74 percent, slightly down from 1.76 percent a quarter ago.
"The capital outflow pressure has been alleviated recently but still we have to keep an eye on the phenomenon and see what the underlying reason is," Yi said.
He pledged to improve shadow banking regulation and transparency and monitor non-performing loans, capital outflow and divergent movement of property prices in cities in order to prevent systematic risks.
China has made great efforts to open up its financial market and will further open up its bond market to foreign investors along with the internationalization of the renminbi, the deputy governor said.
He added that steady progress has been made as the country opened up its onshore bond market to overseas investors, introduced more investment products and opened up market to more foreign bond issuers.
"By the end of last year, there are over 400 foreign institutions investing in China's interbank bond market with a total amount of more than 800 billion yuan ($116.17 billion)," Yi said.
The central bank will continue to work to solve problems like low-efficiency and lack of transparency to make the market more accessible to foreign investors, he added.
The forum was co-hosted by Bloomberg LP, China General Chamber of Commerce - USA(CGCC), with the help from the National Governors Association.
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Astronaut Peggy Whitson broke the US record Monday for most time in space and talked up Mars during a congratulatory call from President Donald Trump.
The International Space Station's commander surpassed the record of 534 days, two hours and 48 minutes for most accumulated time in space by an American.
"This is a very special day in the glorious history of American spaceflight," Trump said. His daughter and close adviser, Ivanka Trump, also offered congratulations to Whitson from the Oval Office.
Whitson said it's "a huge honor" to break such a record. "It's an exciting time" as NASA prepares for human expeditions to Mars in the 2030s, included in new legislation signed by Trump last month. She called the space station "a key bridge" between living on Earth and traveling into deep space, and she singled out the station's recycling system that transforms astronauts' urine into drinking water.
"It's really not as bad as it sounds," she assured the president.
"Well, that's good, I'm glad to hear that," he replied. "Better you than me." Whitson already was the world's most experienced spacewoman and female spacewalker and, at 57, the oldest woman in space. By the time she returns to Earth in September, she'll have logged 666 days in orbit over three flights.
The world record — 879 days — is held by Russian Gennady Padalka. Whitson broke the NASA cumulative record set last year by astronaut Jeffrey Williams; Scott Kelly holds the US record for consecutive days in space — 340.
Whitson is also the first woman to command the space station twice and the only woman to have led NASA's astronaut corps. Behind her was a banner that read: "Congrats Peggy!! New US High-Time Space Ninja." The sign arrived Saturday on the commercial cargo ship, the S.S. John Glenn — barely in time for Monday's celebration.
NASA astronaut Jack Fischer, who arrived at the space station last week and took part in Monday's call, said the space station is "by far the best example of international cooperation."Whitson told the president that spaceflight takes a lot of time and money, so getting to Mars will require collaboration from other countries to succeed. NASA is building the hardware right now to test a new rocket that will carry astronauts farther from Earth than ever before, she said.
"Well, we want to try and do it during my first term or, at worst, during my second term, so we'll have to speed that up a little bit, OK?" Trump replied.
"We'll do our best," Whitson replied.
The debut of the mega rocket is still more than a year away — at least. The date will depend on whether astronauts are on board for the test flight, which could hoist the new Orion capsule to the vicinity of the moon.
Both Whitson and Fischer raised a hand when Trump asked which one of them was ready to go to Mars.
Joining Trump in the Oval Office was astronaut Kate Rubins, who last summer became the first person in space to perform entire DNA decoding, or sequencing. She said she used a device the size of a cellphone for the job, and noted that such sequencing can detect microbes aboard spacecraft and monitor astronaut health.
"That's fantastic," Trump said. "I've been dealing with politicians so much, I'm so much more impressed with these people, you have no idea."

The Balkan country sees China's 'new Silk Road' as a means of achieving growth via greater involvement in its home region and across the globe.
With a population of 7 million, roughly the same as a number of Chinese cities, Serbia will enjoy rapid economic growth, climbing from last year's 2.8 percent to 3.5 percent in 2019, according to the World Bank.
The bank's latest updates suggest the Balkan country's prospects are even rosier than those of the European Union economies, which will average about 2 percent a year.
The promising outlook is partly a result of the country's plan to become a regional transportation hub, which has seen Serbia deepen investment in roads, rails, the expansion of urban infrastructure and even construction of high-tech business parks - similar to the growth engines used in a number of cities in China.
Chinese investors have contributed to the rising level of investment.
"The scale of China's investment in ongoing projects and in the pipeline totals about $10 billion," Li Manchang, China's ambassador to Serbia, said in an exclusive interview with China Daily in Belgrade, the capital.
Li said the developments are mainly the result of the Serbian leadership's recognition of the significance of the Belt and Road Initiative. The two sides signed a memorandum of cooperation in 2015.
Citing Serbia's President Tomislav Nikolic and Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, who is also president-elect, Li said they have repeatedly emphasized that the initiative, proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, will help the world economy emerge from stagnation after the 2008 global financial crisis.
"So, Serbia's top leaders urged their country to grasp the opportunity to find synergies with the initiative," he said.
Ivica Dacic, Serbia's first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, confirmed that Vucic will head the country's delegation at the Belt and Road Initiative Forum for International Cooperation, which will be held in Beijing next month.
"This speaks volumes about the importance Serbia attaches to this significant initiative of global character," he said.
Nikolic paid a state visit to China earlier this year, following President Xi's visit to the Balkan country in June. He also attended a ceremony in Beijing in 2015 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-45).
Dacic is looking forward to the start of direct flights between Serbia and China, which are currently under discussion, while special prominence has been given to the construction of a high-speed rail link between Belgrade and Budapest, the Hungarian capital, which will form a pioneering transportation network along the land-sea link between China and Europe.
"This is an opportunity for regional development, the greater sale of goods and the flow of goods and people," he said.
He added that Serbia aspires to have the closest possible connections with the world: "In that context, we want to see even stronger cooperation momentum with China in infrastructure investment to make Serbia the regional transportation hub."
In response, Li referred to several "firsts" in bilateral cooperation. He noted that the first bridge built by the Chinese in Europe is located on the Serbian stretch of the River Danube, and the high-speed railway linking Belgrade and Budapest will be the first on the continent to be built by the Chinese. The project is expected to be started within the year, once the European Commission completes supervision of loan agreements. Moreover, Serbia was the first country to grant Chinese passport holders visa-free entry for stays of up to 30 days.
According to Li, Chinese companies are currently building highways and electricity generation plants in Serbia, and Chinese investors have already signed a contract with Belgrade's municipal government for construction of a ring road in the city.
Chinese companies are also working to improve Belgrade's wastewater treatment facilities and heating network. Meanwhile, a number of Chinese businesses are vying to win a contract to construct an electricity generation project, which has total investment of $900 million.
China will also help to construct an industrial park covering 300 hectares in its first phase, Li said, adding that having signed the memorandum of cooperation, both sides are hoping to sign an agreement by the end of the year to pave the way for ground to be broken next year.
"Some other Balkan countries have shown 'envy' towards Serbia, which has taken the opportunity of enhancing cooperation with China," he said. "I think Serbia has taken the lead in that regard, and other European countries may follow suit."
According to Branislav Djordjevic, director of the Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade, given the current political and economic situation in the Balkans, it is easy to see how important participation in the Belt and the Road Initiative is, not only for Serbia but for all countries in the region.
He said the institute has long been interested in China, but interest really surged after the conclusion of a strategic partnership between the two countries in 2009. Now, great attention is being focused on the Belt and Road Initiative, which consists of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.
"It is an old truth that prosperity brings peace and stability," he said, adding that the initiative has helped Serbia become more qualified as an EU member. "Since many countries are looking for EU membership, it would be easier for them to be absorbed as economically and politically stable entities. With certain necessary adjustments, combined with the synergies of the Belt and Road Initiative, Serbia could be an engine of progress."
Radosav Pusic, dean of the Confucius Institute in Belgrade, was in full agreement with that view. He said Serbia is a small Balkan country and at critical moments in history, it has been a hostage to fortune.
"When great powers play games, small countries suffer. Belgrade has been destroyed more than 40 times, and we even suffered wars in the 1990s," he said.
The country's economy stagnated for several years after NATO's military action against Serbia ended in the late 1990s, and the 2008 global financial crisis made things even harder. Those difficulties resulted in many young people leaving the country.
Pusic said this is a "historic moment" for Serbia because the country's economic and investment activities with China have become more frequent than ever, thanks to the cooperation framework for the Belt and Road Initiative.
"This is the result of a firmer political and strategic partnership between the countries, which has laid solid foundations for other encounters," said Pusic, a renowned scholar who has written or translated 30 books about classic Chinese literature, poetry and philosophy. He is currently writing a book about the history of ancient Chinese philosophy.
"Against this background, many people in Serbia have shown an interest in the Belt and Road Initiative," he said. "But if it had been raised 10 years ago, recognition would not have been that easy."
Greater efforts will be required, especially on the cultural and publicity fronts, he said.
"The initiative is a concept with tremendous significance, and it offers another perspective to learn more about China. I will do more to help Serbians understand China's traditional culture."

BEIJING — The Chinese government has zero tolerance for any fabrication of economic data as it knows the importance of authentic figures in making correct decisions and bringing tangible benefits to its people.
Of the 23 provincial-level regions that have released first quarter regional GDP figures as of Monday, Northeast China's Liaoning province recorded the slowest growth of 2.4 percent, lower than the national growth of 6.9 percent.
This is not a surprise as the local government admitted in January that a raft of economic data had been falsified from 2011 to 2014 and vowed to eliminate the bubbles in statistics.
In response to the problem, Liaoning reported a 2.5-percent drop in its 2016 regional GDP, compared with a 6.7-percent expansion in national GDP, showing the province's firm stance against falsifying data.
The issue of inflated data originates from the obsession some local officials have for impressive figures, which could bring political benefits under previous official evaluation measures.
China is changing to a more scientific evaluation system from the former system, which placed excessive emphasis on economic indicators.
Fake data are even more harmful to society than fake products, as they will distort the central government's judgment about economic realities and influence decision making.
It is also against the Communist Party of China's ideological line, which underscores seeking truth from facts, and erodes the image of the Party in Chinese people's minds.
As in Liaoning's case, the problem can also hurt the people's material well-being, as inflated fiscal figures caused a reduction in the central government's transfer payments to the local level.
The central government has responded to fake data with a definitive "no."
To ensure data authenticity and reliability, the country has unveiled guidelines on the management of statistical work, improved the legal framework and punished economic data-related violations.
"We will never tolerate statistical violations or data falsifications. There will be zero tolerance," head of the National Bureau of Statistics Ning Jizhe said last month.
Last year, the bureau investigated 15 major statistical violation cases, punishing more than 10 people in each case.
The bureau on Thursday set up a law enforcement unit that aims to become a "sharp sword" against data fabrication.
At a time when the whole country is making strides toward the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020, no fake data should be allowed.
After all, China's pledge to "leave no one behind" in building a moderately prosperous society must be fulfilled among the people, not just on paper.
A two-year pilot program to increase public participation in legal proceedings and improve the standing of court rulings is expected to be extended by a year to May 2018, according to a draft submitted to China's top legislature on Monday.
The draft is to be discussed at the bimonthly session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, which lasts until Thursday.
The Supreme People's Court launched the pilot program in 10 provincial regions, including Beijing, Chongqing, and the provinces of Hebei and Shandong, in April 2015.
Unlike the jury system in the United States, where jurors are randomly selected, jurors in China are chosen from candidates recommended by local communities or authorities.
"But the pilot program aims to increase the random selection, as well as allow more people from different walks of life to participate in legal proceedings," said Shen Deyong, executive vice-president of the SPC.
So far, 13,322 people have been selected as jurors in the 50 courts under the pilot program. They participated in 81,772 case hearings last year, including 11,642 criminal trials, Shen said.
"But some legal experts suggest maintaining juror recommendations from communities and authorities because some cases require common people with professional backgrounds, including medicine and architecture," he said.

Fans left fuming after Ducks deny superstar's wish to keep playing
Stephon Marbury's Beijing Ducks exit over a contract dispute has left Chinese basketball lamenting the loss of one's its biggest and best-loved stars.
The Ducks announced on Saturday that they had terminated the former NBA star's contract after negotiations broke down over his salary and role.
The 40-year-old, who led the Ducks to three CBA titles in the last six years, wanted to play for another season, however after missing out on the playoffs this year, the club only offered him an assistant-coach role.
Marbury, who joined the Ducks in 2011, signed a new three-year deal after winning his third CBA title in 2015.
According to Ducks deputy general manager Xie Haitian, the contract featured an option to retain Marbury as a player or hire him as a coach for the 2017-18 season.
Xie claimed Marbury's agent rejected an offer for his client to become a player-coach and that there was a "big gap" between both parties over the American's salary.
"Despite not wanting to see him leave, the club has to give up the option of keeping him with the Ducks based on the team's strategic rebuilding process and his personal will to continue playing," Xie said.
Marbury posted a statement on Weibo on Saturday, confirming the split.
"My team and I have been discussing this matter with the club for a certain amount of time so that a veteran's last wish can be blessed. That's why we offered the club options, including to cut 20 percent of my salary so that I could work as a player/coach in the coming season," Marbury said in the statement.
The post drew mostly angry responses from fans who sided with their hero.
One fan wrote: "We should've written a joint petition to urge the team to keep Marbury. To abandon a veteran like him doesn't help the team rebuild at all. His leaving will take away fan and media attention on the team."
The Chinese national wheelchair basketball team posted a picture of Marbury with its players on its Weibo account on Sunday accompanied by the caption: "Hero of Beijing Thank You!"
Marbury inspired Beijing to titles in 2012, 2014 and 2015 to become a huge fan favorite, while his celebrity blossomed off the court too.
The bronze statue in his honor outside the Ducks' stadium, the permanent-resident permit he was granted by the Chinese government and a soon-to-be-released movie based on his Beijing career, which premieres in August, are all testament to the Brooklyn-born player's massive popularity.
"The benefit he brought to the city is not only on the court," said former Beijing captain Chen Lei.
"It's embodied by the growing enthusiasm for basketball in the city, the positive energy in and outside the arena and the way he encouraged the young players with the team."
CCTV news commentator Bai Yansong believes the Ducks have handled the situation badly.
"The club actually missed an opportunity to maximize the influence of Marbury although business stands first in professional sports," Bai said in a qq.com column published on Sunday.
"Cutting him now won't result in instant effects of rebuilding a strong team next season while they could've made it perfect by keeping him for one more year before making him coach."
Marbury, meanwhile, plans to keep playing elsewhere.
"I am playing next year and then I'll retire, but you never know," he said.

PARIS - Chinese spiker Zhu Ting clinched her first title after joining Turkish side VakifBank in a 25-19, 25-13, 25-23 victory over Conegliano in the women's volleyball Champions League final held in Treviso, Italy on Sunday.
Zhu contributed 22 points, including 19 in attack and 3 in block, to VakifBank, who lifted their third Champions League trophy after 2011 and 2013.




VakifBank eliminated fellow Turkish side Eczacibasi 3-0 in Saturday's semifinals. They built an 8-6 lead at the first technical of the opening set, and continued their upper hand for a 25-19 win.
VakifBank showed more confidence in their way up to an 8-3 lead, before meeting less resistance to set the score at 25-13.
Conegliano, on the brink of the loss, made a strong comeback in the third set and just trailed by one point at the first technical. However, the Italian side found it hard to turn around, before one of their errors ended up in a 25-23 title-securing victory for VakifBank.
"This year we were down so many times, but our players never gave up. I'm really proud of these players," said VakifBank's head coach Giovanni Guidetti.
"It's easy with these teammates. Everyone is supporting each other and makes it really fun," player Kimberly Hill said in echoing the coach.
A traditional Chinese culture competition will be held on the 22nd World Reading Day on April 23.
Themed “Excellent Chinese Traditional Culture” and an essential part of the 2017 National Reading program, the competition is expected to make full use of the resources of overseas students to enhance Chinese cultural identity abroad.
However, how to implement the reading of Chinese traditional culture among the overseas student groups was a challenge for the organizers.
They decided to base the competition upon the shortlist of the 1st Traditional Chinese Culture Book, setting up a testable resource for more than 10,000 overseas students from 1,000 universities.
The overseas students will also be invited to join in a charity campaign, “Project Reading”, which will involve donating books for primary schools in rural areas.
The competition, from its preliminary rounds to the finals, is intended to build global Chinese confidence and arouse a fever of traditional Chinese cultural reading through web-interactions, video communication, and Chinese traditional book clubs.
The competition is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Overseas Student Development Foundation and the ChinaEquity Group. The final will be broadcast on CETV1 and CCTV4.

Sina Corp, the company behind what's commonly known as China's Twitter, is preparing to compete with the country's web giants in online lending as the mobile market starts to slow.
Sina, which controls online messaging service Weibo Corp, plans to create a separate company dedicated to providing internet finance across its services, Chairman Charles Chao said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
In doing so, it will be opening a new battlefront with larger rivals Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Despite being late to the burgeoning industry, Chao told investors in November that Sina's standing and customer information would help it move quickly once it got the required licenses.
Chao's company has enjoyed accelerating revenue growth in the past 12 months, thanks largely to the rapid take-up of Weibo in rural areas. But that's been tied to rising smartphone sales, which are beginning to slow.
The company is now shunting for new sources of income and has identified online lending-a highly competitive and increasingly regulated arena. Sina said it can make use of data covering hundreds of millions of users that read its news, exchange messages on Weibo and access its websites.
"This is a long shot. We need patience in this area," Chao said at an industry conference in the Central China city of Zhengzhou. "We do have a big dollar-amount investment in this area," he said without elaborating.
Chinese regulators have begun to clamp down on internet financing and peer-to-peer lending after some of the scores of nascent online loan outfits that have sprung up in past years fell under suspicion of perpetuating Ponzi schemes. Chao, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers auditor, said he welcomed government intervention as it would help normalize a saturated market. In an encouraging sign, Sina Pay-which its users employ to pay for services onlineis already gaining traction, he said.
China has leapfrogged ahead to become the global center of financial technology innovation and adoption, outpacing the likes of New York, London and Singapore by a wide margin, according to a joint report by consultancy Ernst& Young and DBS Bank in 2016.
While the speed, sophistication, and scale of development of China's fintech ecosystem have been at a level unmatched in more established markets, the willingness of Chinese consumers to adopt fintech services is just as striking, the study said.
For instance, 40 percent of consumers in China are using new payment methods compared to 4 percent in Singapore, said the agencies. Around 35 percent are using fintech to access insurance products compared to 1-2 percent in many Southeast Asian markets.
Chao said Sina's edge is its detailed knowledge of users. Weibo is commonly used to post everything from videos to text messages and 313 million people access it at least once a month－on par with Twitter. Once combined with information from other sources, that data could be used to better evaluate loan risks.
But as Alipay and WeChat Pay become the duopoly in the area－they had a combined share of more than 80 percent of the third-party payment market in China by 2016, according to IT consultancy Analysys－things are getting tougher for Sina, said Li Chao, a fintech expert at Beijing-based iResearch Consultancy Group.
"It's doubtful whether the stickiness of Weibo users-who normally spend less time on Weibo than on WeChat－is able to help build an accurate and reliable risk control model crucial for online lending," said Li.

For 20 years, Svetlana Radosavljevic has monitored the manufacture of steel and iron from a glass-walled control room in an old production center at Zelezara Smederevo, Serbia's biggest mill.
For many years, the mill, less than a 60-minute drive from Belgrade, could only run one of its two production lines, and it lost about $10 million a month. Moreover, many of the 5,000 workers were unproductive. These factors resulted in a prolonged period of low productivity that almost forced the company into bankruptcy.
Last year, the 105-year-old mill was given a new lease on life, when Hesteel Group, from Hebei province, purchased it for 46 million euros ($49.6 million).
Now, both production lines are running at full capacity at Hesteel Serbia, the mill's new name, which will see production of 2 million metric tons this year, the maximum of a quota agreed between the European Union and Serbia. The acquisition ended seven years of losses, and by the end of last year, the mill was profitable again.
The workers are now more confident because their jobs are secure, and wages have risen by an average of 8 percent, compared with the pre-takeover level.
"Now it is safer, production is higher, and I am more focused on my job because I don't need to worry about becoming unemployed," Radosavljevic said.
Her control room is about 50 meters from the end of a line that produces steel plate. During a visit in June, President Xi Jinping spoke with the workers and management in the control room, which helped to inject the confidence needed to make the most of the lifeline offered by the acquisition.
In addition to the frontline workers, even Serbia's Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, who is also president-elect, is excited about the performance.
Song Sihai, an executive board member of Hesteel Serbia who oversees management of the mill, described his meeting with Vucic. "The prime minister and I discussed the revenue target for this year, which will be about $800 million, and he asked his assistant to calculate the amount it would contribute to the country's economic output," he said.
Sitting in his office, Song, an executive with the parent company, quoted Vucic's conclusion, that the company's revenues will account for more than 2 percent of GDP this year.
"Surely, this will provide great help to Serbia's economic development," he said.
Many Chinese can still clearly remember the plots of movies made in the former Yugoslavia, such as Walter defends Sarajevo and The Bridge.
When he met Tomislav Nikolic, and his delegation in Beijing recently, President Xi Jinping told the Serbian president that he can still whistle the theme from The Bridge.
In June, before he arrived in Serbia on a visit, an article Xi wrote for a local newspaper said the movies had kindled patriotic passion among the people of the two countries for many years.
"Both the Chinese president and premier know those movies well," said Vladan Vukosavljevic, Serbia's culture minister. The two countries have agreed to strengthen cooperation on films and will produce a commercial movie soon.
"We have the idea of refreshing people's memories. Basically, it will be commercial movie that will attract moviegoers worldwide," he said, adding that China has already offered to provide TV and film studios in Beijing.
He said the movie should be shot in both Serbia and in China to help Serbian people to learn more about its Asian partner: "I was impressed by the huge economic development I saw last year during my first visit, and this year. People in Serbia should see this."
He suggested those developments should be wrapped in a modern story about young people, depicting their lives, thoughts, loves and how they view the world.
"But inside that story, we should also show the deep roots of our cultural cooperation and connections. Some music from those old films could be used in the new movie," he said. "The story should be contemporary, and I would like the movie to be seen by audiences in China and across the world."
He said it would be an excellent opportunity to make a movie that will not just show culture, traditions and tourist spots: "We will try to make a really good movie that will be shown at international film festivals."
He believes Chinese directors and actors have great potential, saying many are now gaining global recognition in the fields of movies, visual arts and contemporary art.
"The country's excellent film directors have won many prizes worldwide. So China is not only jumping into the future economically, it is also taking big steps in the world of contemporary culture. It has a lot of things to show the world."

Moviegoers in Hungary can watch five Chinese films starring renowned actors this week during the 2017 Chinese Film Festival, which kicked off in Budapest on Sunday.
Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong action movie star, brought his latest film to the festival, which runs through Thursday. The film, the comedic adventure Kung-Fu Yoga, is a Chinese-Indian coproduction.
Chan, a festival ambassador, said the five films featured are among the best titles from China. The other movies are the dramas Operation Mekong, Mountains May Depart, Xuan Zang and the romance film Book of Love.
"I also found that Hungary is a nice place to produce films as well because this country has such a long history and has enjoyed a richness of cultures," Chan said. "And I found that the cost is relatively low and affordable if we produce films here."
Chan met fans before the launch ceremony and sang a song with students from the Sino-Hungarian School in Budapest.
Gabor Cserkesz, president of Budapest-based Chinese Art Center, wore a black T-shirt with Chan's name on it when he met him.
"I think this ambassador can effectively promote Chinese culture and help Hungarians to understand China better," Cserkesz said of Chan. "And movies are a good medium for us to know each other."
Liu Qibao, head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and Balog Zoltan, Hungary's human resources minister, jointly inaugurated the festival.
Liu was to meet Hungarian leaders and attend other cultural and academic exchanges on Monday before heading to Greece. The trip follows a visit to Morocco to increase cultural cooperation.
Zoltan spoke about the role movies play in bridging understanding. "Our economy has started to pick up," he said. "In the same way that China is keen to develop a friendship with our small country, so we also hope to deepen the relationship with China."
He praised China's Belt and Road Initiative, saying: "We need to rebuild the Silk Road, linking the world from East to West and also from West to East."
Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, is among 28 state leaders who have confirmed their attendance at the Belt and Road Initiative Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on May 14 and 15.
China, Hungary and Serbia have also agreed to build a high-speed railway link between Budapest and Belgrade. They plan to start work on the project after the European Commission gives its approval.

The number of new jobs was 160,000 higher than that in the same period last year, and the unemployment rate was down 0.07 percentage points from a year earlier and 0.05 percentage points lower compared with the previous quarter, official data showed.
"China's job market posted a strong start this year and remained stable in the first quarter," said Lu Aihong, spokesperson of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, at a press conference.
Economists said the lower jobless rate suggested a healthier picture of Chinese economy.
From January to March, job vacancies rose 7.8 percent year-on-year while applicants increased 2.1 percent, according to data with the ministry.
"The need for workers is particularly pressing in the manufacturing sector," said Zhang Yizhen, vice minister of human resources and social security.
China's manufacturing sector in March stayed above the boom-bust mark for the eighth month in a row, reinforcing the message conveyed by increased industrial business profits, and shedding light on economic restructuring progress.

Reconstruction work in the Tibetan villages damaged by a 2015 earthquake in Nepal should be completed this year, according to the Xigaze city government.
Eighteen counties in the Tibet autonomous region were affected when a magnitude-8.1 earthquake struck Nepal on April 25, 2015, with Nyalam, Gyirong, Dingri and Dinggye the worst hit.
"More than 300,000 people (in Tibet) were affected, and more than 11.1 billion yuan ($1.61 billion) has been invested in reconstruction projects," said Basang, vice-mayor of Xigaze, which borders Nepal.
The projects include residential building reconstruction and infrastructure projects related to energy, water conservation, transportation, education, healthcare, cultural heritage and religious sites.
"The reconstruction of 163 villages and 32 special towns is in progress. All villages will have access to basic infrastructure and public services," Basang said.
He said the government also has invited industries to be based in the villages to help provide jobs for residents.
Lhakpa, 73, lives in Gyirong county's Ta village, where most houses either collapsed or were damaged in the 2015 quake. The government agreed to build new homes for all families, and most have now moved into their new homes.
"I never dreamed I would live in such a new house. The old house was uncomfortable in comparison, but it was all I knew," Lhakpa said.
In her old home, the family kept sheep and cows in the yard. It was untidy and smelly, especially in the summer, she said, adding that the animals are kept further away at the new house.
"I want to thank the government. The new house is big and bright, and each family member has their own bedroom," she added.
Nyalam was one of the most severely affected counties, with more than 3,500 collapsed or damaged houses, and a direct economic loss of about 2.8 billion yuan.
Nyima Gyalpo, 40, whose house in Nyantok village was damaged in the quake, said his family moved into a new home built by the government in October.
"We're pleased to live in the new house. We have also asked the local government to add a yard," Nyima Gyalpo said.
"In addition to the new houses, the government is building roads to our village, and all families will soon have running tap water. I want to thank to the government for providing us with a new life."
Footballpool－a combination of soccer and billiards－uses inflatable colored balls and a 'pitch' with six holes. The world's first footballpool league has just kicked off in Prague, following its inaugural world championships in the Czech capital in February. Michal Cizek / Afp
PRAGUE - A dark-haired girl kicks a white soccer ball gently towards a black eight ball, then wrings her hands in despair as she fails to sink it in the corner pocket to seal a victory.
Katerina Ziegelova, a 26-year-old clerk, is one of the pioneers of footballpool, the latest addition to the hybrid sports family.
The Czech footballpool league has just kicked off in Prague, after the sport was showcased in its inaugural world championships in the Czech capital in February.
A combination of soccer and billiards, the sport uses inflatable soccer balls - white, solids and stripes, like in billiards - and a playing 'pitch' with six corner and side pockets, proportionately larger than a regular pool table.
No cues are needed - the players kick the white ball while walking on the pitch.
"I'm not much of a football fan but I like pool, and this combination is very interesting," said Ziegelova, who teamed up with her boyfriend, Lukas.
Clad in black-and-yellow shirts complete with numbers and names, they lost their opening league tie against a team led by Jiri Novotny, who organized the competition along with a friend.
Novotny is no stranger to ball games, having scored 20 goals in 89 matches for the Czech Republic national futsal team, according to the Czech Football Association website.
"I saw a video on YouTube where two Americans played the game in a garden, drinking beer and doing a barbecue," said the wiry 28-year-old futsal defender.
"So we designed the table, set up a footballpool association and started calling it a sport," he said, adding this was the first such competition in the world.
Footballpool pits two teams with two players against each other, with each player taking on each opponent in two matches.
That was the formula used at the first world championships at a shopping mall in Prague.
"We had 70 teams from countries including Algeria, Kyrgyzstan, Brazil, Afghanistan, Germany and Slovakia," said Novotny, adding that a Czech-Slovak team won.
Prague is also scheduled to host the next worlds in February 2018.
Shopping malls are a typical venue for the sport as Novotny said he leased the legless footballpool "tables" to companies like bowling alleys, which then charge clients a fee to play.
"This is really a game for anyone - at the tournaments we have organized, we had children, pensioners, women, men," said Novotny.
The footballpool association currently has 15 playgrounds across the Czech Republic. It expects to install another 20 over the next two months.
Big names
Novotny has managed to lure some big soccer names to the sport, including former Hearts and West Brom striker Roman Bednar and ex-Dortmund and Liverpool midfielder Patrik Berger.
"It's not just kicking the ball; I like sports that require some thinking and precision, like this one," Bednar said.
"I must say I fell in love with it. It's not a bad sport at all, and it's for everyone who likes new things."
Among active players, Czech striker Jan Chramosta, a former under-21 international currently plying his trade with top-flight side Mlada Boleslav, is equally excited.
"It's fun. You can make various bets and spice up the experience a bit," he said, adding he had already taken on a few of his teammates.
"It's a lot about technique, about the way you kick the ball, about tricks and rotation. Not that I'm an expert there," he chuckled.
Living testimony for the benefits of footballpool, Novotny went on to play in the futsal league playoffs right after the tie, grabbing three assists as his Slavia Prague beat Pilsen 6-4 to advance to the top-flight semifinals.

Sector hit by rising costs of raw materials which have been passed on in prices
China's television industry has seen a downturn in the first quarter, with major TV manufacturers witnessing a drop in net profits and sales affected by the rising price of raw materials.
Sichuan Changhong Electronic Co Ltd said its revenue was 16.63 billion yuan ($2.41 billion) in the first three months, up 7.93 percent year-on-year, but net profit plunged 84.75 percent to 32.98 million yuan in the quarter, marking the biggest earnings fall among the companies that released financial reports.
Qingdao-based Hisense Group posted a revenue and profit decline in the first quarter. Its revenue dropped 5.98 percent to 6.7 billion yuan, while net profit slipped to 269 million yuan, down 49.53 percent compared with same period last year.
Hisense blamed the rise in the costs of raw materials and shrinking production for the decline.
Another home appliance manufacturer Shenzhen-based Konka Group Co Ltd said its gross margins from TVs and white goods, which include air conditioners and refrigerators, witnessed a decline in the first quarter due to the price rises of raw materials.
In March, the TV sales of Skyworth Group Co Ltd in the Chinese market dropped 25 percent year-on-year. TCL Corp said sales of LCD TVs fell 7.7 percent to 2.22 million units in the first quarter.
Statistics from Sigmaintell Consulting Co Ltd, an industry consultancy, showed shipments of TVs in the Chinese market reached 11.69 million units in the first three months, down 14 percent year-on-year.
Six major Chinese TV manufacturers－including Hisense, Skyworth and TCL－sold 8.16 million units from January to March, accounting for a 70 percent market share, according to Sigmaintell.
Analysts said the price rises of TV panels drive the growth of overall TV prices, which causes a decrease of consumers' purchasing intentions.
Liu Buchen, an independent researcher in the home appliances sector, said the price rise of panels had continued for nearly three quarters.
"In the past, the price of panels often rose 10 percent, but the price grew 40 to 50 percent this time," Liu said.
Panels account for more than 50 percent of TV costs, Liu explained. "The increase in TV prices lagged for several months, causing major TV brands to suffer a loss."
Moreover, internet television companies, such as LeTV Holdings Co Ltd and Xiaomi Corp, are facing more pressure. Sun Taitong, an analyst from industry watcher China Market Monitor, said the internet TV brands grew rapidly last year, but their sales had a downturn in the first quarter.
Chinese TV manufacturers have entered into a period of adjustment. Konka hired new senior management personnel. Skyworth Digital appointed Liu Tangzhi as its CEO.
TCL, meanwhile, started to reorganize its panel business and initiate new overseas M&As.

Home-sharing company Xiaozhu Inc has launched China's first shared-house service for business travelers, driven by the increase in startups and the changing structure of the workforce.
Established in 2012, Xiaozhu is one of the first Chinese home-sharing platforms and has around 150,000 shared-house sources in 306 cities in China.
"We will provide about 80,000 homes for business trips in over 50 cities by the end of this year, starting from Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu," said the company's CEO Chen Chi.
Rooms for business travelers, priced at 300 to 400 yuan ($44 to $58), are equipped with office supplies and an invoice is promised to be provided within 11 working days.
Another new service designed for business travelers is monthly settlement and company accounts, but the company admitted it needs the support of a stronger IT system. When asked about the reason to start such a new product, Chen said "last year, more than 15 percent of our users chose our service for business trips".
In 2015, business travelers accounted for 36.5 percent of overall home-sharing users, while half were individual tourists, according to a report by Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys.
Chen said the service initially targeted young employees in startups and SMEs, but some large enterprises have also showed an interest.
So far, a dozen internet companies, maker spaces and co-working offices have signed cooperation agreements with Xiaozhu.
As young people born in 1990s become the major part of the labor force and with the growth of startups, business trip demand is becoming more diversified and personalized, he said.
His goal is to team up with 5,000 corporates and serve 100,000 users within this year.
Tang Wu, a young entrepreneur who operates a dozen shared homes in Shenzhen, said many of his clients are business travelers.
His first "home" was located right behind a five-star hotel near the city's exhibition center. In future, he plans to provide space of 170 to 200 square meters, and supply visual equipment and meeting facilities.
Dang Jianwei, an expert on innovative economies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said startups and SMEs, who are highly sensitive to costs, may be interested in such new services.
However, the challenge is to win large enterprise users who need guaranteed standardization of services, he said.
China officially launches its second - and the first domestically developed - aircraft carrier on April 26, 2017, in Dalian, Liaoning province. [Photo/Xinhua]
The launch of China's first domestically developed aircraft carrier is expected to boost the country's shipbuilding sector－especially military vessels, analysts said.
According to a research note from Guosen Securities, the market for the various military vessels which are in the aircraft carrier fleets could reach 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion), while the maintenance and upgrade of the equipment would be a larger market.
"Our second aircraft carrier is designed, constructed and equipped independently," said Hu Wenming, chairman of China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, at the launching ceremony in Dalian, Liaoning province.
"It underscores that we have forged a team for building aircraft carriers," Hu added.
The company is China's biggest manufacturer of naval products. It is able to design and build different types of naval ships including submarines, missile destroyers and fleet support vessels.
One of its listed companies－China Shipbuilding Industry Co Ltd－published its annual report on April 26, revealing that its annual revenue reached 52.064 billion yuan in 2016 and total profit was 1.094 billion yuan, a big turnaround from the loss of 2.931 billion yuan for the year before.
The turn from loss into profit stands out given that the country's shipbuilding sector was influenced by the gloomy international shipping industry.
"In 2016, the integrated development of the military and civilian products has become an important impetus. All the major military tasks had been implemented smoothly according to the plan," the annual report indicated.
In addition to the aircraft carrier, the company also delivered several naval vessels, such as lightly-armed frigates and coast-guard ships. It said major breakthroughs were made in submarine military trade projects.
On April 21, China Shipbuilding & Offshore International Co Ltd, the trade arm of the CSIC, signed a contract with a Malaysian shipbuilding company, the company said on its website.
According to the contract, the CSOC will design and construct for the Royal Malaysian Navy four Littoral Mission Ships, primarily used for maritime patrol, coastal security and search and rescue operations.
It is Malaysia's first significant defense deal with the Chinese company.
It is assumed that China will construct more aircraft carriers following the official launch of the second one. Ministry of National Defense spokesman Yang Yujun said that the nation will form an overall plan for the development of carriers and key supporting infrastructures. But he did not reveal how many aircraft carriers China will construct at the ministry's regular news conference on April 27.
Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates a point during her victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci at last week's WTA Stuttgart Grand Prix. Reuters
LONDON - Maria Sharapova might have to wait until June 20 to see if she will be welcomed back to Wimbledon this year.
Sharapova, the 2004 champion at the All England Club, returned to the WTA Tour last week after serving a 15-month ban for doping and reached the semifinals in Stuttgart, leaving her ranked No 262.
The Russian's return has sparked controversy on the tour, with some rivals saying she has been given preferential treatment.
The former world No 1 is set to play two more events, in Madrid and Rome, before the deadline for direct entry to Wimbledon qualifying.
Deep runs at those events could earn her enough points to make the main draw, while she will also find out on May 16 if she gets a wild card for the French Open.
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said on Wednesday there will be a meeting of the tournament's sub-committee on June 20, when it will be clear which players have been accepted into the main draw.
Wimbledon begins on July 3, its latest start since 1895.
Andy Murray, the world's No 1 men's player, said he expects Sharapova to be granted a wild card if she needs one.
"But I'm sure they are hoping they don't have to make the decision," Murray said at the launch of the Queen's Club tournament, a warm-up event for Wimbledon.
"There's a good chance that she can get in by right, which I'm sure is what she's hoping for and that's what Wimbledon would be hoping for."
Lewis said qualifying at nearby Roehampton would be a ticketed event for the first time, and that action on one of the courts will be broadcast live.
He said this was not linked to the possible appearance of Sharapova, but because of the upsurge in interest in qualifying matches.
Lewis also announced there will be a 12.5 percent increase in total Wimbledon prize money, to $40.8 million.
Winners of the singles titles will each pocket $2.85 million, a 10 percent increase from 2016.
First-round losers will receive $45,000, a 16.7 percent increase from 2016, as Wimbledon officials say they are placing more emphasis on helping lower-ranked players.
In another development, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said two-time Wimbledon finalist Ilie Nastase will not be invited to the Royal Box on Centre Court.
The 70-year-old Romanian has been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation following his comments about the skin color of the baby Serena Williams is expecting, and his foul-mouthed outbursts during a recent Fed Cup match between Romania and Britain.
"What he did, we have to say, his actions were not very good and we condemn them," Brook said.
Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Williams' unborn baby when he said: "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?"
The two-time Grand Slam winner also asked British captain Anne Keothavong for her hotel room number and verbally abused umpire Jaume Campistol and referee Andreas Egli before swearing at Keothavong and British player Johanna Konta as he was banished from the court.
Nastase was escorted out by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie.
A national icon in Romania, Nastase defied the ban by briefly returning the following day. He pointedly refused to apologize in the immediate aftermath of the controversy, saying he had no regrets.
Nastase, who twice finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in the 1970s, is awaiting sanction by the International Tennis Federation after being hit with a provisional suspension.

RIO DE JANEIRO - Lionel Messi will reportedly not accompany an Argentine legal team in Switzerland on Thursday in its appeal against the forward's four-game international ban.
Messi has already served one match of the penalty, issued in March after he was found guilty of abusing a linesman in Argentina's 1-0 victory over Chile in Buenos Aires. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was also fined 10,000 US dollars by the FIFA disciplinary committee.
Messi had been expected to attend the hearing at FIFA headquarters in Zurich as the Argentine football association (AFA) exhausts all options in its bid to reduce the sentence.
Despite his likely absence, Messi will participate in the session via video link, according to widespread media reports, which cited "personal reasons" for his decision not to travel.
Argentina, who are without a coach after the sacking of Edgardo Bauza last month, are currently in danger of missing the World Cup finals for the first time since 1970.
The two-time World Cup winners are currently fifth in the CONMEBOL South American zone standings with 22 points from 14 matches, 11 points behind leaders Brazil.
The top four teams at the end of the qualifying competition will automatically progress to football's showpiece tournament in Russia next year. The fifth-ranked team will earn a play-off spot against the top side from Oceania.




 
BEIJING - Premiums received by Chinese insurers rose 32.45 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, official data showed Wednesday.
Premiums reached 1.59 trillion yuan ($230 billion) from January to March, said the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
By the end of March, the industry had combined assets totalling 16.2 trillion yuan, up 7 percent from the beginning of the year.
The commission attributed the steady growth of premium income to better regulation and risk protection.
Since the beginning of this year, financial regulators have worked to prevent systemic risks as the importance of financial security grows. Last month, the CIRC announced a targeted campaign against violations to restore market order, with measures against false capital contributions, chaotic corporate governance, irregular investments and fake data.

BEIJING - China's photovoltaic power facilities generated 21.4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity in the first quarter, up 80 percent year on year, new data showed Thursday.
The amount accounted for 1.47 percent in the country's total power generation, the National Energy Administration said in a statement.
Around 2.3 billion kWh of photovoltaic power, more than 10 percent of the total, was lost, partly due to the lack of supporting facilities and the mismatch of solar capacity with local power demand.
Newly installed photovoltaic power capacity in Q1 reached 7.2 million kilowatts, taking the total to 84.6 million kilowatts.
The country aims to install at least 105 million kilowatts by the end of 2020.
By 2020, electricity from renewable energy will account for 27 percent of China's total power generation.
LONDON - Three people were injured as a helicopter crashed in central England's Wycombe Air Park, local media reported Friday.
One of them has suffered life-threatening injuries and another had serious head, chest, leg, abdominal and shoulder injuries, Sky news said.
HOHHOT - It is early morning and Qi Xiaojing is driving her van to deliver freshly picked vegetables from her farm to the doors of residents in Ulanhot.
The 34-year-old ethnic Mongolian and university graduate manages her farm in Ping'an, a village in Ulanhot city in China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region.
She has 27 greenhouses and seven cold frames, covering 1.36 hectares.
"Vegetables and fruit can grow in cold frames in summer, and in greenhouses every season, so I am able to produce them year-round," she said.
This May Day holiday, she held the second annual strawberry festival on her farm, drawing more than 5,000 people to pick strawberries, taste local food and enjoy ethnic dance performances.
Last year, her farm earned a net income of 160,000 yuan ($23,200). With the financial support of the local government, she now has a new van and six delivery carts. But it was not easy when she started her business in 2013, four years after graduating from the Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology.
She borrowed about 10,000 yuan from relatives and was only able to rent one greenhouse.
She grew mushrooms at first. With her husband, Shan Chunpeng, she would finish picking mushrooms around midnight, and Shan would pack and deliver them around 2 am with a secondhand truck that often broke down.
"He only slept three hours a day since he had another job at 6 am as a construction worker," she said.
In 2014, she decided to grow melons but they all died.
"My relatives were no longer willing to lend me money after seeing my failure. Those were really tough days," she recalled.
In 2015, she came up with the idea of opening an online store on the smartphone app WeChat, selling fruit and vegetables from her farm and other villagers'.
"The villagers were growing quality vegetables but did not have an effective channel to sell them. So, I thought that maybe I could help them," she said. "To my surprise, they sold really well in my online store."
Qi has helped more than 200 local households sell vegetables in Ulanhot as well as chickens to other cities in China. Each family's income has increased by about 6,000 yuan a year on average.
"With Qi taking charge of delivery and sales, I no longer have to take a bus to the city and be a street vendor," said Xing Changqing, a 54-year-old villager who sells cucumbers to Qi.
Guo Shihuai, the village's Party chief, said university graduates like Qi are brave enough to try new things.
Qi's father expected her to stay in the city after graduation, but she insisted on returning to the countryside.
"There is a sense of achievement when I can share the benefits with the villagers. Sharing is important for an entrepreneur," she said.
With Qi taking the lead, 20 households in the village have started greenhouse-farming businesses.
She plans to open Ulanhot's first delivery station in June.
"I hope that I will be able to understand market demand better to realize my dream of selling products from my farm and villagers' farms to more cities in the country."

The agreement was reached by guarantor countries Iran, Russia and Turkey to de-escalate violence in key areas in Syria, noted a statement issued here by UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
"The secretary-general welcomes the commitments to ceasing the use of all weapons, particularly aerial assets; to rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access; and to creating conditions for the delivery of medical aid and meeting civilians' basic needs," the statement said. "The commitments made should not affect the rights of Syrians to seek and enjoy asylum."
On Thursday, Russia, Iran and Turkey signed a memorandum in Kazakhstan's capital Astana on the creation of four safe zones in war-torn Syria. The countries will outline the maps by June 4.




Hangzhou police officer Zhou Xiangjun helps a visitor in August to retrieve an item that had fallen into West Lake. Provided to CHINA DAILY
Zhou Xiangjun, a police officer who has patrolled the shores of Hangzhou's West Lake for almost 15 years, is more used to spending time in the water than in the media spotlight.
That has changed in recent days, however, after a TV show reported on his exploits in saving people who jump or fall into the lake as well as salvaging people's bags, cameras and mobile devices from the deep water.
Zhou said he has prevented dozens of people from attempting suicide at the popular scenic spot in Zhejiang province. He also estimates that the total value of the smartphones he has recovered over the years comes to about 100,000 yuan ($14,500).
"As a police officer, it's my job to save lives. I also would like to help people salvage stuff from the lake," said the 57-year-old, who joined the police force 36 years ago. His main tasks are to patrol the waters, maintain public security and deal with emergencies, such as saving drowning people or those who attempt suicide.
Because the scenic spot is the subject of many legendary love stories, West Lake is a common choice for suicide attempts.
"I can recognize a suicide attempt quickly by a person's actions or words," he told China Daily. "Usually I will go forward and try to chat with them ... and I start to talk them out of it.
"To make people feel comfortable, I've learned many dialects. It has turned out to be very useful. All of those I've talked to have returned home safely."
In recent years, people have increasingly turned to him to salvage their belongings from the lake.
"The number of tourists here is many times that of years ago, and it makes West Lake the most crowded scenic spot in the city," he said, adding that the popularization of smartphones and rising popularity of selfies make the phone one of the items most easily lost.
Zhou used to jump into the lake to find lost things. Once, however, he hit an underwater stake, making him realize that dangers lurk beneath the surface. So he tied a magnet to a fishing line to recover items. Then he did some research in his spare time and upgraded his equipment, making a hollow steel tube that can be extended to more than 4 meters long to find things in deeper water.
He fixes a strong magnet to one end of the tube and puts the magnet side into the water to retrieve lost property.
"For smartphones, only the charging port and SIM card port are made of metal components that can be detected and attracted by a magnet," he said. "It requires patience, experience and skill to pull them out."

The election is seen as the most important in France for decades with two diametrically opposed views of Europe and France's place in the world at stake.
The National Front's Le Pen would close borders and quit the euro currency, while Macron, who has never held elected office, wants closer European cooperation and an open economy.
According to an Elabe poll for BFM TV and L'Express, Macron will get 62 percent of the votes in the second round compared to 38 percent for Le Pen, an increase of three points for the centrist candidate compared to his projected score in the last Elabe poll.
The showing is Macron's best in a voting survey by a major polling organisation since nine other candidates were eliminated in the first round on April 23.
The survey was carried out after a rancorous final televised debate between the two contenders on Wednesday, which Macron was seen as having won by French viewers, according to two recent polls.
A separate poll by Odoxa said a quarter of the French electorate was likely to abstain in Sunday's vote, many of them left-wing voters disappointed after their candidates missed reaching the runoff.

SEOUL - The Republic of Korea began early voting on Thursday in the election to replace ousted president Park Geun-hye.
Early voters can cast ballots at about 3,510 polling stations across the country before the election next Tuesday, the National Election Commission said in a statement.
It's the ROK's first presidential election with early voting after introducing it for parliamentary and mayoral elections in recent years, the statement said.
Pre-election surveys show liberal candidate Moon Jae-in comfortably leading his two main rivals - a centrist and a conservative.
The winner will be sworn in as the new president immediately, forgoing the usual two-month transition. Park's impeachment and removal from office changed the ROK's election schedule, so the new president will serve one full five-year term.
Park is currently jailed at a detention center near Seoul awaiting her trial on allegations that she extorted money from businesses, took kickbacks from some of those companies and committed other wrongdoing, all in collaboration with a longtime confidante. The trial is to formally start later this month.
A commission-run website showed about 4 million people had voted by midafternoon. The ROK has 42,479,710 eligible voters, according to the election commission.




Higher turnout
Many observers believe disquiet over the recently installed US missile defense system, known as THAAD, may have a major role to play in the election, especially among younger voters.
A higher turnout, especially among those in their 20s to 40s who have historically been indifferent to politics, is seen boosting Moon, who wrote in a book published in January that the ROK should learn to say "no to America".
Unless there's a major upset, Moon, who advocates a moderate approach on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and criticizes conservatives and their hardline policies, will become the next president.
A Gallup Korea poll published on Wednesday shows him with 38 percent support in the field of 13 candidates, with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger at 20 percent.
"Sometimes I feel our government is bending over backwards trying not to upset the alliance with the United States," said Jason Lim, a 36-year-old South Korean engineer living in Washington.
"I want our president to be someone who isn't afraid to say what's best for Korea."

DHAKA - The Bangladeshi government has signed three deals with Chinese and Thai firms on the country's first-ever metro rail project.
Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL), a Bangladeshi state-owned enterprise founded to implement the metro rail lines across the Dhaka city, signed the separate contract packages (CPs) including CP-2, CP-3 and CP-4 worth over 58.26 billion taka ($719 million) with the firms, Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited, a Thailand-based construction firm, and Chinese state-owned Sinohydro Corporation Limited.
Under the deals, the firms will build metro rail tracks, stations and depot of the long cherished 20.1-km Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line-6 that will link north Dhaka with the south through 16 stations.
According to the project, the package CP-2 is for the civil and building works of the Depot, CP-3 and CP-4 is for the construction of metro rail tracks and elevated stations.
Officials of DMTCL, Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited, a Thailand-based construction firm, and Chinese state-owned Sinohydro Corporation Limited signed the agreements on behalf of their respective sides at a ceremony on Wednesday in capital Dhaka.
Sinohydro signed the deal worth 15.96 billion taka for CP-2 while Italian-Thai Development Public Company Limited signed deal for all the three packages.
The Danish minister for environment and food says the Nordic country will consider exporting oysters to China, after the species spread become a hot topic in China.
The Danish government is mapping how many invasive oysters there are, and how they affect the country's environment and fishery stocks, said Esben Lunde Larsen on Friday. He is on a delegation to China along with Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen.
When the mapping is completed, the country will be able to pursue the issue on a solid foundation, he said.
Larsen made the comments after a post on social networking site Weibo about the invasion of an exotic oyster, known as the Pacific oyster, generated a flurry of enthusiastic responses from Chinese people.
The Danish Embassy had posted the article on April 24 to raise awareness about the threat the species posed to the country's environment and fisheries.
The embassy made a small joke in the story inviting Chinese people to eat oysters in Denmark, but was not expecting such a strong reaction from readers. One person even proposed to "eat the species to extinction."
However, oysters are not on the list of aquatic products being exported from Denmark to China at the moment.
Larsen added that the food ministry and industry of Denmark would work closely on the potential of exporting oysters to China, but the two countries had not yet signed any oyster agreement.
He also said Chinese tourists were "welcome to come to Denmark on oyster safaris".
BEIJING - While the much-awaited first Chinese-built passenger jet C919 is ready to make its maiden flight Friday, it may take much longer for the newcomer to take off in the aviation market.
Shaking the dominance of aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come.
Scheduled to depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on May 5, the C919, with 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737.
A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC).
But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success.
Currently, Chinese airlines seem to be more keen to spend money on wide-body aircraft to enhance their global routes with rising enthusiasm for overseas travel. Those jets are still the exclusive province of Boeing and Airbus.
China Eastern Airlines signed contracts in 2016 to buy 20 A350-900 aircraft from Airbus and 15 B787-9 aircraft from Boeing to be delivered between 2018 and 2022.
China Southern Airlines announced in April that it will buy 20 A350-900 with a total catalog price of nearly $6 billion.
Boeing and Airbus are very mature aircraft manufacturers, and COMAC should seek further cooperation with them to learn from their experiences, according to aviation analysts.
But looking ahead, single-aisle planes like C919 will be the market mainstream and COMAC should do well in the Chinese market, one of the most competitive.
Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of $1 trillion.
China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing.
The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field being economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities.
If the maiden flight is successful, COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries.
Also, to pave way for C919 to enter foreign markets, the airworthiness certification of the jet will be a part of bilateral air safety agreement talks between China and the EU.
China has invested heavily in commercial passenger jet manufacturing. In 2007, plans to develop a domestic large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line.
The ARJ21, the country's first regional aircraft also produced by COMAC, began commercial operations in June 2016 following its maiden flight in 2008.
A consortium of financial institutions in Asia－led by China Minsheng Investment Group－said it is betting big on the Belt and Road Initiative and will spend many billions of dollars to get onboard the investment boom.
CMIG, the country's biggest privately owned investment conglomerate, said it had teamed up with its regional peers to set up a fund worth $10-$15 billion in Hong Kong last week, in their quest for first-mover advantage in the Belt and Road push.
The strategic partners comprise a long list of well-established names across the region.
They include Zhongtai International in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong-based Sun Hung Kai, AMTD Group and BlackPine, Japan-based Orix Corp, South Korea-based Mirae Asset Global Investments and IndoChina Capital from Southeast Asia.
"Such a super partnership, led by CMIG, is looking to tap the potentially huge opportunities coming from the massive funding gap in Belt and Road countries and regions," said Calvin Choi, senior assistant president of CMIG.
"Partners would certainly be better off investing in groups rather than going it alone," he said.
"By reducing risks and improving fundraising efficiency, eventually this helps partners find out promising projects that best fit in with their investment expertise."
Typically, financial technology, high-tech and other emerging industries are where the new fund would keep its eyes trained, Choi noted.
Though he didn't reveal a timeline for the first round of fundraising, Choi said they would "go with the tides".
The new fund is based in Hong Kong, a choice that highlights the financial hub's edge as the "super connector" and gateway to the massive mainland market, he added.
Lawrence Chu, founder and managing partner of BlackPine Private Equity Partners, said the Belt and Road Initiative had what it takes to be a long-term and stable investment channel. E-commerce and online payments in Southeast Asia, for instance, stood out in a land of opportunities that they could not afford to miss, Chu noted.
Choi confirmed the Southeast Asia is where the new fund is looking, with the North American market coming next.
The fund will be working under the mechanism of Asia Institutional Investor Alliance, an organization established by CMIG in October last year in partnership with China-ASEAN Investment Corporation Fund, JP Morgan and UBS.
Founded in Shanghai in 2014 with a registered capital of 50 billion yuan ($7.3 billion), CMIG comprises 59 private enterprises, including Giant Interactive Group backed by billionaire Shi Yuzhu, Suning Commerce Group and China Oceanwide Holdings Group.

Chinese liquor giant Kweichow Moutai Co plans to expand into the health tonic liquor market by partnering with Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Group.
The two companies have signed a strategic partnership agreement to start cooperation production and sale of the liquor. The two companies also plan to set up a joint venture.
Moutai Chairman Yuan Renguo said health tonic liquor was a major new business of the company during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), in response to surging demand for health related products.
Health tonic liquor is a transparent medicated liquid obtained by using wine as a solvent to soak out the effective components of herbs or animals which can reinforce body fluid and nourish the blood.
Moutai's revenue reached 13.31 billion yuan ($1.93 billion) in the first quarter of 2017, up 33.24 percent year-on-year. Its share price moved above 400 yuan a share in April.
The company established its health tonic liquor unit in 2005. However it only has a single digit market share currently, compared with leading brand Jing Brand Co Ltd, which had a 40 percent of the market last year, according to a report conducted by Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Group.
The Xiuzheng's report said the value of the health tonic liquor market was expected to exceed 44 billion yuan by 2020, with an estimated annual growth of 15 percent.
Founded in 1995, Xiluzheng ranked third in 2015 among the top 100 Chinese pharmaceutical companies with total assets of 17 billion yuan, according to data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, released last year.
The company began to develop health tonic liquor in 2002 and the business reaped about 54 million yuan per year in sales, the report said.
"The share of resources between two major companies in the baijiu and pharmaceutical industries will be a typical example of cross-industry cooperation," said Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Chairman Xiu Laigui.
Wang Qi, deputy executive director of the China Alcoholic Drinks Association, said health tonic liquor could be a new growth engine for the liquor industry.
China's health tonic liquor market grew 8 percent to reach 24 billion yuan in the first three quarters of last year, according to data from the association.

Overseas push puts Midea on high-growth trajectory R&D centers, acquisitions turn appliance maker into tech major
The establishment of overseas plants, research and development centers and the acquisition of a number of international intelligent automation solution makers have helped expand the business of Midea Group, a Chinese appliance maker, according to its senior executives.
Based in the manufacturing hub of Foshan, Guangdong province, in the heart of the Pearl River Delta, Midea currently has 17 R&D centers in eight countries. It has invested over 20 billion yuan ($2.89 billion) in R&D over the past five years, according to the company.
The company is planning to set up more R&D centers in Austria, Germany and Singapore in the near future, aiming to tailor-make its products as per local needs. That's part of its larger goal to make them globally competitive.
Midea has 12 overseas plants already, covering major home appliance goods and automation solution products.
"We are more willing to build joint ventures in overseas markets, especially countries and regions along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road," said Fang Hongbo, chairman and president of Midea Group.
China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 with the aim of building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes.
Since the establishment of its first overseas plant in Vietnam in 2007, Midea has efficiently expanded its operations. It has been offering its products in global markets over the past few years.
According to Midea's annual report, the group's overseas sales reached 64 billion yuan, accounting for nearly half of the company's total sales in 2016.
Its overseas sales revenue is expected to reach more than half of the company's total revenue in 2017, according to a company source.
Fang, its chairman, said: "Growing market demand in emerging countries and regions, along with an improving domestic demand for smart home appliances, will help boost sales in the years ahead".
Gu Yanmin, vice-president of Midea, said the overseas acquisitions had helped expand its business to new industrial areas, amid intensifying competition in the domestic home appliances market.
"We are now more likely to identify ourselves as a leading technology company, not only in the area of home appliances, but also in industries like heating and ventilation, robotics and automation solutions," Gu said in an early interview with China Daily.
In recent times, it effected a series of international acquisitions.
Midea took a majority stake in German robotics manufacturer Kuka GA last year. It bought more than a 50 percent stake in Israeli motion solution provider Servotronix Motion Control Ltd earlier this year.
"We have been seeking another growth path beyond home appliances, changing our business model driven by mass production at low cost to scientific and technological innovation," said Gu.
Midea also took a large stake in Italian air conditioner maker Clivet SpA and an 80 percent stake in Japanese home appliance manufacturer Toshiba Corp's white goods business last year.

The traditional frugality of Chinese people and their high rate of household savings are being challenged by the younger generation, who are motivated to spend with borrowed money, a new study has found.
One in four of those aged between 18 and 27 use pay-by-credit services Ant Check Later, a personal loan and installment service under e-payment provider Ant Financial Services Group, as these freer spenders form the very core of the country's burgeoning consumer-credit landscape.
That translated into 45 million young adults using the money of tomorrow for discretionary purchases, Ant said. People born in the 1990s constitute 47.3 percent of the platform's registered users.
Among them, nearly 40 percent prioritized the service as a payment option over its sister service Alipay, China's largest mobile wallet by market share. This is 11.9 percentage points higher than those born before 1985.
Ant Check Later extends consumer credit ranging from 500 yuan ($72) to 50,000 yuan based on its risk assessment of customers using big data analysis. Credit is interest-free for up to 41 days.
Young urban dwellers are comfortable about borrowing money to fund their modern lifestyles, such as buying gym training sessions and tipping online bloggers.
While youngsters in relatively affluent areas like Shanghai, Beijing and Zhejiang province take the lead in credit consumption, their peers in the Tibet autonomous region came fourth, borrowing an average of 963 yuan per month.
Ant attributes the upsurge to deepened internet penetration, a quick takeoff in smartphone usage, and the consequent easier access to micro loan services which are unattainable through conventional financial institutions.
The report said 99 percent of the young consumers can repay borrowed money on time, partly also because the troves of consumer data through online transactions could help vendors screen out those with a bad credit history.
The findings echoed a study by insurer Manulife, which discovered that China's millennial generation (aged between 18 and 35) are among the most indebted of their peers in Asia, taking on debt that is 18.5 times their income.
Consumer loans in China are projected to more than double over the next five years to more than 50 trillion yuan, according to market data consultancy Mintel.
"Young adults are quick adopters of new payment methods like internet pay-by-credit services. Installments are clearly a trend and a lifestyle choice," said Aaron Guo, a senior analyst at Mintel.

Higuain brace has Italians eyeing Cardiff
MONACO - Gonzalo Higuain urged his Juventus teammates to keep their feet on the ground after he scored both goals in a brilliant 2-0 win in Monaco on Wednesday that left the Italian squad on the brink of the Champions League final.
Argentine striker Higuain was set up by Dani Alves to open the scoring in the 29th minute, then converted an Alves cross just before the hour as Juve claimed a crucial victory in the semifinal first leg at Stade Louis II.
The Italian champion has the final in Cardiff on June 3 in its sights, with a showdown against holder Real Madrid, Higuain's former side, looking probable.
"The dream we have been pursuing since August has been to get to Cardiff and we are just one step away," said Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season following his $98 million transfer from Napoli.
"We have not won anything yet, so we mustn't get carried away," added Higuain, who ended a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages.
"I stayed calm. I knew everyone had faith in me and that hard work is always rewarded in the end."
Juventus shone in all areas against a Monaco side that has lit up Europe this season with a thrilling brand of attacking soccer.
Buffon still strong
But the host found Juve's defense rock solid, with Gianluigi Buffon majestic as ever in goal.
The 39-year-old, making his 149th European appearance, denied Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao in the first half and produced a stunning fingertip stop on Valere Germain late in the second.
Juventus, which welcomes Monaco to Turin for the second leg next Tuesday, has now gone over 10 hours without conceding in the Champions League and Buffon has blanked the opposition in five matches in the knockout rounds.
"In every game I want to show that I deserve to play at this level despite my age," said Buffon, twice a losing finalist in the Champions League.
"I work hard every day for this. The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it.
"We had the right approach. They are a fearsome team and the only way to beat them was playing the way we did."
Buffon also praised coach Massimiliano Allegri for his decision to bring Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defense, thwarting Monaco's attack and allowing Alves to wreak havoc down the right.
"Gigi showed that he is still a great goalkeeper. He always does it in big games, and Higuain scored two lovely goals," said Allegri.
"But to get results, everyone needs to work hard. You need to make sacrifices and track back and he did that too."
'More clinical'
Juventus could wrap up a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this weekend, when it faces city rival Torino, while Lazio awaits in the Italian Cup final.
To put its performance in the principality into context, Monaco had won its previous 13 home games and scored in 41 consecutive matches at Stade Louis II since November 2015.
"They were more clinical than us - with two or three chances they scored and we couldn't put any of ours away. Buffon made some incredible saves," said Monaco head coach Leonardo Jardim, who sorely missed injured marauding leftback Benjamin Mendy.
Now Monaco must attempt to become just the third team ever to overturn a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League.
"It is difficult, but we need to keep believing. The best thing is to believe it is possible, even if we only have a five percent chance," Jardim added.
In the meantime, Monaco will switch its focus back to its attempt to win the French title.
It plays Nancy on Saturday and needs two wins from its last four league games to become champion.

The farming area for genetically modified crops has increased 110-fold globally in 21 years since the commercialization of biotech crops began in 1996, and reached a historical record last year, according to an international GM crop commercialization annual report released on May 5.
According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA)'s annual report "Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2016", last year the farming area of biotech crops increased to 185.1 million hectares, compared with 179.7 million hectares in 2015 and 181.5 million hectares in 2014. ISAAA describes itself as a not-for-profit international organization that shares the benefits of crop biotechnology.
However, voices across the world that challenge the safety of GM crops have never ceased. According to the 2016 report, 26 countries, including 19 developing and 7 industrial, grew biotech crops. Developing countries grew 54 percent of biotech crops, compared to 46 percent for developed countries.
Eight countries in Asia and the Pacific grew 18.6 million hectares of biotech crops in 2016.
Ten countries in Latin America, including Paraguay and Uruguay, grew a combined 80 million hectares of biotech crops in 2016.
That year, the leading countries growing biotech crops continued to be the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and India. Combined, these five countries farm 91 percent of the global biotech crop area.
"Biotech crops have become a vital agricultural resource for farmers around the world because of the immense benefits for improved productivity and profitability, as well as conservation efforts," said ISAAA Chair of the Board Paul S. Teng.
In 2016, South Africa and Sudan increased farming of biotech maize, soybean and cotton to 2.66 million hectares, up from 2.29 million hectares in 2015.
Brazil increased their biotech area of maize, soybean, cotton and canola by a remarkable 11 percent this year – maintaining its ranking as the second largest producer of biotech crops after the United States Brazil’s biotech soybeans account for 32.7 million hectares of the 91.4 million hectares grown worldwide.
SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook Inc will hire 3,000 more people over the next year to speed up the removal of videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts, in its most dramatic move yet to combat the biggest threat to its valuable public image.
The hiring spree, announced by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, comes after users were shocked by two video posts last month showing killings in Thailand and the United States.
The move is an acknowledgment by Facebook that it needs more than its recent focus on automated software to identify and remove such material.
"Given the importance of this, how quickly live video is growing, we wanted to make sure that we double down on this and make sure that we provide as safe of an experience for the community as we can," Zuckerberg told investors after the company's earnings late on Wednesday.
The problem has become more pressing since the introduction last year of Facebook Live, a service that allows any of Facebook's 1.9 billion monthly users to broadcast video, which has been marred by some violent scenes.
Some violence on Facebook is inevitable given its size, researchers say, but the company has been attacked, most recently by British lawmakers, for its slow response.

Global auto giants flocking to join Formula E frenzy
Three short years after being launched, FIA's Formula E Championship is making good on its slogan to "Drive the Future" while rapidly evolving into one of the most important series in auto racing.
"There are more automobile manufacturers participating in Formula E than any other series, even Formula One, because everyone is looking at the future and they know that the future is electric," Ivan Yim, managing director of Team Techeetah, told China Daily at last month's Mexico City ePrix.
"Fossil fuel is a twilight resource. It will end one day. There's no alternative but to go electric," Yim said. "If you look 10 years down the road, Formula E will be bigger than Formula One."
New energy vehicles stole the spotlight at the recent Shanghai auto show, where 159 electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars were showcased, representing about 11 percent of all exhibits.
The Chinese electric vehicle start-up NIO, formerly known as NextEV, featured a lineup of 11 vehicles, including the new ES8 SUV and flagship EP9, which the company touts as the world's fastest electric car.
Before debuting at the Shanghai show, NIO had already attracted wide attention thanks to outstanding performances in Formula E, securing the inaugural drivers' championship.
Compared to Formula One, it's easier to transfer electric technologies used in racecars into electric street vehicles, according to Nick Sampson, vice-president of research and development at Faraday Future.
"Formula One is all about air dynamics. Millions and millions of dollars are spent on fine tuning ways of creating dynamic air pressure, which has very little relevance in production cars," Sampson said.
"But we find Formula E attractive because it's concentrated on areas that are relevant to production cars, such as the battery and electric drive unit. In these key areas, technology used on the formula track and technology used in road cars is similar."
US-based Faraday unveiled its prototype EV FF91 last January in Las Vegas ahead of the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. Production is planned to start in 2018.
Faraday Future has partnered with Dragon Racing in season three of Formula E, where it wants to "further push forward developing the technology for road cars in the competitive environment of motor sports," Sampson said.
FIA, global overseer of motor sports, announced in late March the nine powertrain constructors it has granted homologation for seasons five, six and seven of the Formula E Championship. Among them is BMW, which currently participates as a partner of Formula E's US-based Team Andretti.
Audi will continue to back the Abt team, while Mercedes-Benz, which isn't yet on the list, signed an option agreement last year to potentially join Formula E in the 2018-19 season.
The reason why the fifth season of Formula E is attracting major automakers is because for the first time races will be completed using just one car rather than two, thanks to improved battery technology. Teams will use identical chassis and batteries, but constructors will be responsible for their own powertrains.
"The homologation of the powertrains that will be used as from season five is a very significant step because it means the cars will be able to run for twice as long while, at the very least, maintaining the same performance level," said FIA president Jean Todt.
"This highlights how motor sport can stimulate and accelerate development of new technologies which can then be applied to road cars."

To help make up for its shortfall in winter sports know-how ahead of the Beijing 2022 Olympics, China has been borrowing expertise from around the world, sending staff members to experience various aspects of major international events.
The Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games sent 81 people during the 2016-17 winter season to the host cities of big tournaments, including the 2017 Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan, and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. They were sent to gain insights into 24 practical aspects, ranging from competition organization to venue operation, the committee said on Friday.
The effort was part of the International Olympic Committee's knowledge-transfer Observer Program, which invites future Olympic organizers to observe firsthand the hosting practices for current and upcoming events.
Supported by governing bodies such as the International Ski Federation, Beijing also sent 50 homegrown specialists, including 2022 event managers, over the past winter to multiple world championships in Europe to follow the work of their foreign counterparts through an initiative called a "shadowing program".
Yan Cheng, human resources director of the Beijing organizing committee, hailed the field study as an essential resource for Beijing to build an international and professional team for the 2022 Olympics.
"Practical learning overseas provided us access to the scop e, scale and complexity of running Olympic Games, while the knowledge transferred matters a lot for improving our own expertise in every aspect regarding the delivery of an extraordinary event," he said at an experience-sharing symposium on Friday.
China is short of operational and technical professionals as well as venue construction expertise in hosting winter sports event.
For instance, the country had never built a bobsleigh track until a project for the sport was approved for northwestern Beijing's Yanqing county for 2022. And an international design contest for Beijing 2022's only permanent venue, the National Speed Skating Oval, was won by international architect Populous due to domestic bidders' lack of experience.
Gui Lin, an official from Beijing 2022's department of planning, construction and sustainability, said a trip to Koenigssee, Germany, to observe operation of one of the world's oldest bobsleigh tracks was invaluable.
"The observation shed light on designing such facilities of our own in Yanqing in terms of track layout, competition zone and broadcasting arrangement," said Gui, who visited Koenigssee in February. The 2017 Bobsleigh and Skeleton World Championships were held there during Gui's stay.
Gui's colleague Liu Haodong stressed that practical experience gained in real events makes the staff ready for potential challenges in the future.
"The observation helps us to prepare for any possible situations. For example, we need to prepare more power supplies in Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, since operation of snow events needs abundant electricity," said Liu, who visited the St. Moritz resort in Switzerland during the World Ski Championships in February.
Meanwhile, the organizing committee has hired 10 foreign experts, such as Bernhard Russi, chairman of the International Ski Federation's Alpine Committee, to advise it on athletic organization, venue design, snow making and slope grooming.

Academy helping Chinese athletes earn a shot at US college ranks
Chinese youngsters hoping to compete in US college tennis are getting a head start, thanks to a unique program supervised by American experts.
The Beijing-based Love Tennis Academy is running clinics of its Tennis Education Nexus (TEN) program at the National Tennis Center - home of the China Open - in the north of the capital, aimed at preparing kids for admission to US universities by virtue of their command of the sport.
The academy's head coach, Doug MacCurdy, knows a thing or two about what American universities are looking for, having helmed the men's tennis program at Princeton from 1974 to 2000.
"If you want to go to a prestigious college outside of China, being a tennis player will help you immensely," said MacCurdy, a former general manager of the International Tennis Federation.
"Everybody has good test scores if you apply for universities like Princeton. Tennis will help you stand out among all the good students. They are looking for well-rounded people."
Differing from other programs across the country, TEN boasts a mix of academic study and tennis training - 10 hours on court a week, plus math, science, English and art lessons taught by teachers from the Beijing Haidian Foreign Language Shi Yan School and Beijing New Talent Academy on their campuses.
"It's important to instill the idea (in China) that tennis and education are a pretty good mix," said MacCurdy, who along with David A Benjamin, the former executive director of Intercollegiate Tennis Association, was asked to develop TEN's training curriculum while also instructing local teachers on the US collegiate athletic system.
"We are putting together an instructional system (of youth tennis training) which is logical and easy to follow," said MacCurdy.
Since his first visit to China in 1986, MacCurdy has witnessed the game's rapid growth professionally, but he is convinced the next great leap could be at the collegiate level.
"In my experience working with the Chinese Tennis Association and the provincial teams, one thing I thought could have been improved is that when players are very young they shouldn't have to give up studying," he said.
"That maybe changed a little bit. There are more people interested in tennis and there is probably a room for growth in college tennis, in addition to the traditional system."
Unlike in the US, where athletic talent is nurtured in collegiate systems like the NCAA, Chinese athletes have usually had to give up academic education early on after being drafted into China's State-run sports system.
For modern, education-focused Chinese parents, that's a major negative.
"I don't expect him to be a professional player in the future, even if he has started training at a young age," said Zhu Dan, mother of an 11-year-old who has been practicing tennis after school for the past four years.
"I'd like him to embrace tennis as a speciality while maintaining focus on study as an ordinary student," said Zhu.
"Hopefully, tennis could be a stepping stone for him to earn admission to an elite university in the US."

In London's Chinatown, members of the BC Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the community, talked to Chinese about voting while offering free advice and assistance on voter registration.
The project hopes that more Chinese voters will participate in the election. Those who are not eligible to vote can still help by volunteering, said Christine Lee, chair and founder of the BC Project.
Encouraging Chinese to register to vote and participate in politics is not simply an individual matter. It is important for political parties too. Only through enhanced awareness, participation and support can the country speak up for minority communities, Lee said.
Some party representatives were also present to give a helping hand. The Chair of Chinese for Labour Sonny Leong CBE said that some Chinese members of his party are fighting for every parliamentary seat they can possibly win to ensure the needs and interests of the community are heard at a political level.
BC Project, also known as the British Chinese Project, is trying to inspire voters with renewed efforts to raise awareness and make their voices heard in the upcoming election.
A census from 2011 showed there were 430,000 Chinese in the UK. That number is likely to be well over half a million by now. An earlier survey in 2006 suggested that 30 percent of Chinese who are eligible to vote are not registered to do so. In some constituencies, particularly in cities like London and Manchester, these numbers could be big enough to make a difference in the outcome.




The husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, is to step down from carrying out royal duties this autumn, Buckingham Palace has announced this morning.
The Palace said in a statement that the decision was made by the Duke of Edinburgh, the longest-serving consort in British royal history, and is supported by the Queen.
It said: "His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh has decided that he will no longer carry out public engagements from the autumn of this year. In taking this decision, The Duke has the full support of The Queen.
"Prince Philip will attend previously scheduled engagements between now and August, both individually and accompanying the Queen. Thereafter, The duke will not be accepting new invitations for visits and engagements, although he may still choose to attend certain public events from time to time."
Prince Philip, who turns 96 next month, is patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations and will continue to be associated with them, but "will no longer play an active role by attending engagements".
The announcement comes after The Queen's most senior aides summoned her entire household to an unusual emergency meeting this morning causing rumors and speculation on social media to go into overdrive.
But Buckingham Palace's press office let it be known that the meeting did not involve the health of the royal couple.
Philip Mountbatten was born in Greece and raised in the UK, he was also educated in France and Germany, later joining the Royal Navy in 1939 when he was 18.
At just 21-years-old, the duke became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, making him one of the youngest in that position in the Royal Navy. He went on to reach the rank of commander in 1952.
Philip and Queen Elizabeth II married in 1947 and they have four children, including Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are both great-great grandchildren of Queen Victoria.
Prince Philip is also the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria.

Liverpool remains on track to secure top-four finish
WATFORD, England - Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told his players to brace themselves for the Premier League stretch run after they retained control of their top-four destiny with victory at Watford on Monday.
Emre Can's stupendous mid-air scissors kick earned Liverpool a 1-0 win at Vicarage Road that gave it a three-point cushion over Manchester City in third place.
Victory in Liverpool's last three games - against Southampton, West Ham United and Middlesbrough - will guarantee it a Champions League berth, but Klopp said there was still much work to be done.
"We need to stay focused, we need to stay concentrated," said the German.
"We have pressure until the end of the season, but that's a positive pressure. It means we are fighting for something.
"So we'll do everything for the points we can get, but it won't be easy.
"If people think we already have the three points against Southampton then they've not seen them play this season. They are another really strong side.
"Nobody can take these points away from us tonight and now we have time to work and prepare for Southampton on Sunday."
Can settled proceedings in first-half stoppage time, meeting Lucas Leiva's floated pass with a textbook volley that flew past Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.
Can has battled a persistent calf problem for the past 12 months and Klopp praised the Germany midfielder for gritting his teeth and fighting through it.
"If he couldn't be positive after this goal, something would be wrong," Klopp said with a smile.
"He's a good player. He's had a calf problem, but we couldn't leave him out. We had a lot of talks about this.
"People wondered what was wrong with him, but we needed him in these moments. He said, 'I'm going to try.'
"Sometimes he wasn't as good as he could have been, but now those problems are sorted, he's physically strong and he can build on these performances.
"And if he can score goals like this, it makes even more sense."
Coutinho hobbled
Liverpool lost playmaker Philippe Coutinho to a dead leg early in the game, which saw Adam Lallana make his return from a month-long lay-off as a 13th-minute replacement for the Brazilian.
Klopp offered no prognosis on Coutinho's condition, only to say that the injury - sustained in a collision with Watford's Adrian Mariappa - had been "really painful".
Liverpool also hit the bar through a dipping Lallana volley and Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes had to make several second-half saves to keep the score close.
The host came agonizingly close to snatching a stoppage-time equalizer when centerback Sebastian Prodl blasted a shot off the crossbar.
"I told the players after the game that if they want to kill me, that's a good way to try it. I thought I felt something in this area," Klopp said, gesturing to his heart.
Watford manager Walter Mazzarri, whose side remains 13th in the standings, said the final score was not an accurate reflection of the game.
"If you look at all of Liverpool's games, they usually create five or six clear chances," said the Italian.
"Today we hardly conceded any chances and we also had a couple of our own, so overall it was a good performance.
"I usually don't like to speak about luck, but today we were completely unlucky.
"Apart from Prodl's shot against the crossbar, there were two incorrect offsides against (Stefano) Okaka and (Troy) Deeney. We played a really good game."

'Best I've ever scored' - Emre
Emre Can said his sensational bicycle kick that secured Liverpool a crucial 1-0 win over Watford on Monday was the best goal of his pro career.
The 23-year-old German international - who took his tally to five for the season - produced his moment of magic in first-half stoppage time.
The victory kept Liverpool in third place in the standings, but in terms of Champions League qualification it pushed it four points clear of fifth-place Manchester United.
The top four qualify for Europe's premier club competition.
"I have never scored a goal like that - maybe when I was younger. That is the best goal I've ever scored," Can told Sky Sports.
"I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was that I wanted to head it. Then I didn't think too much what to do.
"But the most important thing was three points after knowing what happened yesterday. It was a big game for us.
"Everything is in our hands. If we win the three games we are in the Champions League. We are confident. If we perform how we can perform, we can do it."
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was in awe of what he termed the "spectacular" goal.
"Emre has played really well in the past few weeks but he could still play better. However I don't think he can ever score a better goal than that," Klopp told Sky Sports.

James passes Abdul-Jabbar mark as Cavs crush Raptors
CLEVELAND - Unstoppable. Untouchable. Undefeated.
Back on the playoff stage, where he's starred so many times before, LeBron James is making things look easy.
James scored 39 points, passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time career playoff scoring list and pushed the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 125-103 blowout over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday night.
Just like a year ago in the conference final, the Cavs are up 2-0 on the Raptors, who had better figure some things out or this series will be over quickly.
Toronto was blown out for the fifth straight time in Cleveland in the playoffs, losing each by an average of 24.2 points.
Game 3 is on Friday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre.
James, who has won a road game in 27 consecutive series, appears determined to toss Toronto aside. He finished 10 of 14 from the field, dropped four 3-pointers and 15 free throws.
"He did miss six free throws," cracked Toronto's Kyle Lowry. "He's playing unbelievable. He's playing like LeBron James."
In Cleveland's past nine playoff wins, James is averaging 34.9 points, 10 rebounds and 8.1 assists.
Kyrie Irving had 22 points and 11 assists and Channing Frye scored 18 points for the reigning champions, who are 6-0 so far defending their title. Cleveland is 9-0 since losing Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals.
The Raptors didn't start Jonas Valanciunas, but he led them with 23 points. Toronto only got five points from All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who didn't make his first field goal until the first minute of the fourth quarter.
Of bigger concern might be the status of Lowry, who sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. He scored 20 points but spent the fourth quarter in the locker room icing his ankle.
"It's pretty sore," Lowry said after limping to the postgame podium. "I'm going to get treatment and get ready for Game 3."
James came in needing 25 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, and he overtook the Hall of Fame center with a 3-pointer in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped the Cavs open a 26-point lead.
James (5,777 points) now only trails Michael Jordan (5,987), the player to whom he has been compared since he was a teenager, for the most points in postseason history.
James is also trying to match Jordan's six titles. He's halfway there, and the way the Cavs are playing, he could have No 4 before long.
Raptors coach Dwane Casey promised the Raptors "would be a different team tonight coming out".
He started a smaller lineup, benching the 7-foot Valanciunas and forward DeMarre Carroll in favor of guard Norman Powell and forward Patrick Patterson.
Casey also moved Serge Ibaka from power forward to center.
The moves were intended to give Toronto more ball handlers and open the floor on offense.
They didn't work, simply because the Raptors couldn't contain James.
Casey, though, is confident his team can go home and even the series.
"I believe in our players," he said. "I believe in our guys. I know there is another level we can get to. I've seen it before."
It won't matter if James raises his, too.
Milestone
James also became the fourth player with 300 career 3-pointers in the postseason, joining Ray Allen (385), Reg-gie Miller (320) and Manu Ginobili (312).
On his 40th birthday, coach Tyronn Lue said the best gift would be a win. But the former NBA journeyman, who won two titles and played for seven teams, reflected on the milestone.
"A little kid from Mexico (Missouri) with just dreams and hopes," he said.
"You never thought it would come true, but I worked hard and I'm here and I'm just blessed."

In a press conference, the minister said that nine other cases had been found of vertical transmission from mother to fetus, and three of birth malformations linked to the virus.
Zika is a virus transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also a carrier of dengue and chikungunya.
Only around 20 percent of infected adults will even show symptoms but it is dangerous for pregnant women as the virus can be transmitted from mother to fetus, or through sexual relations or blood transfusions, said Espinoza.
It can lead to babies being born with microcephaly or a range of other malformations.
Espinoza asked the population to strengthen their efforts to protect pregnant women from contracting the virus.
The Ministry has led a campaign against the mosquitoes across the country by spraying chemicals, destruction of areas in which mosquitos could lay eggs.






Ambitious new initiative aims to encourage kids to get their kicks
Rugby union is desperate to grab a piece of China's sports pie as the game targets a major expansion beyond its traditional bases of Europe and Australasia.
Japan will host the 2019 Rugby World Cup while the sport will also feature at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, in seven-aside format.
But it is China where World Rugby is really focusing its Asian attention.
"When we talk about the importance for rugby, whether it's for the world or Asia, China is absolutely our gem going forward," Ross Mitch, general manager of Asia Rugby, told China Daily at a recent Beijing conference hosted by World Rugby and the China Rugby Football Association.
"China has 1.4 billion people. If we can get just 1 percent, 14 million, playing rugby, we are going to take the world by storm," he said.
World Rugby's Asia One Million program hopes to develop 1 million new players, both professional and amateur, through 2020 on a budget of around $1.8 million.
It recently launched the China campaign of that initiative, which will be rolled out in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong and Liaoning provinces, where Get Into Rugby (GIR) training clinics will be delivered to schools and communities, with help from foreign experts.
Funded by World Rugby, the program aims to cultivate 50,000 new Chinese players every year through 2020.
But those figures are highly ambitious, according to insiders, given the lack of expertise, manpower and competition in a nation where the public perception of the sport is low.
"There's still a stereotype that rugby is dangerous because it can look brutal at times," said Cui Weihong, secretary general of CRFA.
"That affects public participation, although it has gained a modest level of attention."
First introduced to China from Japan in the early 1990s, rugby union was only played within a small circle of expats and college students for two decades until an upturn in 2009, when the seven-a-side version was included in the Olympic program for the first time.
With Olympic success weighing heavily on its agenda, the General Administration of Sport of China added rugby sevens to the program of its quadrennial National Games in 2013 to prompt funding and support from local sports bureaus.
Rugby sevens made its Olympic debut at the 2016 Rio Games.
China now has about 35,300 players registered with the CRFA, while the number in Japan had surpassed 105,600 in 2016, according to World Rugby.
Very few Chinese players have trained professionally,
The expansion of the GIR program, launched in China in late 2012, was expected to broaden the game's outreach to ordinary schools and significantly grow the participation, said Cui.
"Strengthening grassroots promotion by working together with the education authorities and collegiate sports associations is one of our priorities this year. The GIR program has provided help just in time."
The number of GIR events across China will be increased by 40 percent through September from 40 held at 20 locations last year, according to Asia Rugby.
"So now the job is to get it into schools," said Ben van Rooyen, GIR coordinator for Asia Rugby.
"When the green lights go on ... these schools are open, we should be geared in terms of trainer education, equipment and facilities."
The China Agriculture University (CAU), where the game was initially brought to the country, has kicked off its own school promotion organized by its physical-education staff and alumni.
Zhang Zhiqiang, CAU varsity team coach and former national team captain, has set up a junior camp on campus to offer more than 30 students from nearby primary schools training in the non-contact 'touch' version of the sport twice a week.
Similar programs have been rolled out at 20 primary and secondary schools around Beijing.
"Rugby's educational function has started to be accepted by a lot of parents," said Zhang.
"Hopefully by promoting the less-physical version of the sport we can help it take off and it will spread to other schools."

Superstar's 'unique' scoring prowess keeps club on track for another CL title
MADRID - Cristiano Ronaldo's sensational scoring ability was hailed as "unique" by Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane on Tuesday after the Portuguese superstar's latest hat-trick left the club on the verge of another Champions League final by thrashing Atletico Madrid 3-0.
Ronaldo's treble was his second against Atletico this season and second straight in the Champions League after notching three goals against Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals.
"Goal scoring is something he has over others, that is what makes him unique," said Zidane.
The victory extended Real's hex over Atletico in the Champions League over the past four seasons.
Real has eliminated Diego Simeone's men in each of the past three years, including in the 2014 and 2016 finals.
There was a distinct disparity between the sides this time, as Ronaldo's header opened the scoring in the 10th minute.
He struck twice more in the final 20 minutes to give the scoreline the reflection Real's dominance deserved.
"The team was tremendous. I scored the goals, but the team was phenomenal from start to finish," said Ronaldo.
The win also kept Real on course to become the first side to retain the Champions League in 27 years.
"It is not easy to score three goals against Atletico," said Zidane.
"We played great. The first half hour was fantastic, we had a lot of chances to score the second, and we got it in done.
"We are very happy with the performance. To score three goals and, most importantly in a (two-legged) tie, keep a clean sheet at home is very important."
Madrid, which is looking to reach its third final in four seasons, was in control from the start at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium and took advantage of Ronaldo's impressive form.
He had scored five in the two legs of the quarterfinals against Bayern Munich, including the hat-trick in the second leg at Bernabeu.
"The team was amazing, it was a complete match," said Ronaldo, who reached the 400-goal milestone in his 389th game with Madrid. "We played well from start to finish."
He opened the scoring after Atletico's defense failed to fully clear a cross into the area.
Midfielder Casemiro sent the ball back in with a bouncing shot and Ronaldo got ahead of defender Stefan Savic to nod it past goalkeeper Jan Oblak.
Ronaldo, Madrid's all-time scoring leader, added to the lead after Atletico defender Filipe Luis lost the ball in a challenge with the superstar, who entered the area and fired a right-foot shot past Oblak into the upper corner.
He scored his 10th Champions League goal of the season with a low shot from inside the area after a pass by Lucas Vazquez.
Ronaldo now has 103 goals in the Champions League, not counting one he scored in the qualifiers, which is three more than Atletico has scored since the new format was created in 1992.
Madrid dominated early on, controlling possession and causing problems for Atletico's defense with set-pieces taken by midfielder Toni Kroos.
Madrid had 11 attempts against only one for Atletico in the first half alone. It ended with 16, against four for Atletico.
"Our first 30 minutes were fantastic, we started with great intensity," Zidane said. "And in the second half we were very effective."
Ronaldo is now just one goal behind Barcelona rival Lionel Messi as the Champions League's top scorer this season, with 10.
Seven of those have come in his past three games, as he struck five of Madrid's six in seeing off Bayern 6-3 on aggregate in the quarters.
"It's great to have a player like him," said Real midfielder Kroos.
"You can play good in defense, control the midfield, but in the end you need a player who will score - and he did. "He always does. He scored five in the quarterfinal and three today, so it's incredible for us."
There were contrasting emotions for Atletico boss Simeone, who refused to give up hope of a miraculous comeback on what will be the final European match at Atletico's Vicente Calderon Stadium on May 10 before the club moves to a new venue next season.
"More than ever, I am calm," said Simeone.
"We have to do something impossible... and being Atletico Madrid, we might be capable of that."
Barcelona pulled off the biggest comeback in Champions League history earlier this season by overcoming a 4-0 first-leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain.
And Simeone is clinging to the hope of something similarly unexpected.
"We need to forget about this game," said the Argentine. "It seems impossible, but it is football and football has these unexpected things that make it marvelous. Anything can happen. Anything is possible.
"Until the last drip of hope is gone, we will give it everything we have."

WuXi NextCODE, a contract genomics company headquartered in Shanghai, announced on Tuesday that it received a $75 million capital injection, as China targets precision medicine using gene sequencing as a new focus for improving health and medical standards.
The fresh financing is being led by Yunfeng Capital, a fund backed by billionaire Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and Singaporean investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte, WuXi NextCODE said in a statement.
The company said it will use the proceeds from this round of financing to advance the commercialization of its consumer solutions for the China market, strengthen its global leadership position in informatics, and expand its capabilities in artificial intelligence and deep learning.
"Genomics is at the crossroads where data and biology meet," said Li Ge, chairman of WuXi NextCODE and its parent WuXi AppTec Inc.
"Through its comprehensive capabilities for digitizing, managing and analyzing genome data, WuXi NextCODE is positioned to build an open access and capability platform that enables any organization or individual to benefit from genomic big data," he said.
WuXi NextCODE was formed in 2015 after Shanghai-based contract research giant WuXi AppTec acquired genomic analysis firm NextCode Health, a spinoff from Reykjavik, Iceland-based Decode Genetics.
With offices in Shanghai, Reykjavik and Cambridge in the United States, the company provides capabilities for generating, organizing, mining and applying genomic data.
Ideally, gene sequencing can enable doctors to use a person's genome and physiology to determine the best treatments for a disease.
To make better use of the pool of information, WuXi NextCODE announced a partnership last year with Huawei Technologies Co, China's largest telecommunications equipment maker, to enable different institutions and researchers to store their data.
Included in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), precision medicine is predicted to be the next big thing as China moves to upgrade its healthcare landscape. By 2030, the industry expects investments to soar to approximately 60 billion yuan ($8.7 billion), according to US-based market research firm BCC Research.
Gene research is not only an effective way to prevent birth defects and discover genetic diseases in their early stages. It can also provide drugs and treatment plans tailored to a person's unique genetic code and environmental exposure, said Xu Ruiqi, general-manager of BGI's Shanghai branch, a world-leading genome sequencer.

WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin discussed the Syrian crisis and fighting terrorism in the Middle East, the White House said on Tuesday.
The two leaders also discussed "the very dangerous situation" on the Korean Peninsula, the White House said in a statement.
"The conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons," said the statement, adding that they also discussed "at length working together" to fight terrorism across the Middle East.
The United States would send a representative to the cease-fire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan on May 3-4, the statement added.
It was the first phone call between Trump and Putin since Washington and Moscow wrangled over a US strike on the Syrian government last month.
On April 6, Trump ordered a targeted missile strike at a Syrian military airfield in response to a chemical weapons attack in the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun.
After the US strike, Syrian state TV called the assault an "aggression" and both Russia and Syria had denied that the Syrian government launched the chemical weapons attack.
The Russian government also condemned the US strike against the Syrian government as "aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law."
After the incident, Trump told reporters last month that the United States is "not getting along with Russia at all" and the relations between the two countries "may be at an all-time low."

One of Scotland's oldest whisky producers said it is tapping into the lucrative Chinese thirst for the drink after securing a major distribution deal with one of China's food and beverage giants.
Loch Lomond Group, based in Alexandria in Scotland, has entered into a partnership with China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp, also known as COFCO.
The Scottish independent distillery full range of whiskies, which include Loch Lomond, Glen Scotia and Littlemill, will be available to customers throughout China.
Loch Lomond, which was founded in 1814, is based in West Dunbartonshire in Scotland. The company's Littlemill distillery was founded in 1772.
The company said the distribution deal would make China one of Loch Lomond Group's key export markets. COFCO has an extensive network of 700 retail outlets and more than 1,000 sub-distributors.
Demand for high-quality whisky has soared in the Chinese mainland, driven in part by rising middle-class incomes.
According to the Scotch Whisky Association, the value of exports to China increased 0.5 percent to 41 million pounds ($52 million) in 2016, with the market continuing on an upward trend. That followed a previous drop in sales after Beijing's anti-corruption measures curtailed lavish spending among public servants.
But it is the increasing taste of China's rising middle-class for single malt whiskies that is exciting the industry.
Single malt exports to the world's second-largest economy amounted to 12.9 million pounds last year, a 66 percent jump from 2015.
The Alexandria-based group noted whisky sales increased 12-fold in China during the last 10 years.
"We're very excited about our new partnership with COFCO across the fast-growing Chinese market," said Loch Lomond CEO Colin Matthews.
"COFCO is a very ambitious, energetic and innovative organization with a great team and exciting plans for the future, which matches our own aspirations, both for China and as a group."
After visiting Loch Lomond Group's Alexandria malt and grain distilleries, as well as its Glen Scotia distillery in Campbeltown, Castle Li, general manager of COFCO Wine & Spirits, said: "COFCO is determined to use all of its resources, energy and strengths to succeed in bringing the Loch Lomond and Glen Scotia Scotch whisky portfolios to the Chinese market and its many millions of consumers."

James leads rested Cleveland squad to one-sided romp over Raptors
CLEVELAND - LeBron James considered swigging a beer while scoring 35 points and Kyrie Irving added 24 as the Cleveland Cavaliers picked up where they left off following a long layoff and throttled the Toronto Raptors 116-105 on Monday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference semifinal.
The Cavs hadn't played since April 23, when they completed a four-game sweep of Indiana. But the defending champions didn't show any signs of rust against the revenge-seeking Raptors, who lost to Cleveland in last year's conference final.
Toronto dropped to 1-12 in playoff openers.
"I think we had great energy, and even some of the mistakes that we had we were able to cover up for because our energy level was high," James said. "But we'll be a lot better on Wednesday."
Kyle Lowry scored 20 and DeMar DeRozan 19 for the Raptors, who were within seven in the third quarter before James dropped a 3-pointer, converted a three-point play, drained another 3 - and then considered washing down a brew.
After drawing a foul on a missed layup, James playfully hopped toward the sideline, where a courtside server was passing by.
The four-time league MVP reached and grabbed a beer bottle from her tray and brought it toward his lips before putting it back.
By then, he and the Cavs had already downed the Raptors.
With trade acquisitions Serge Ibaka and PJ Tucker, Toronto looked better equipped to beat Cleveland than the Raptors squad that lost in six games in last year's playoffs.
Trouble is, James only seems to be getting better.
After nearly averaging a triple-double against the Pacers, he reminded the Raptors that to move on they'll have to beat him.
Before the game, Toronto coach Dwane Casey talked about the big comebacks that have been a theme in these playoffs. The Raptors blew a 25-point lead to Milwaukee in the first round, while the Cavs overcame a 25-point deficit and pulled off the biggest second-half rally in playoff history.
"There's no lead safe in the NBA," Casey said.
That's what happened to the Cavs in the first half as they built an 18-point lead only to watch the Raptors go on a 19-3 burst to pull to 41-39.
But Cleveland regrouped and, playing a turnover-free second quarter, led 62-48 at half.
James' legs looked fresh early on as he and Irving teamed up on a stunning alley-oop.
After he poked the ball away for a steal, James took off up the floor with Irving on the break.
James pointed at the backboard and Irving understood the message, bouncing a pass high off the glass that James dunked with his left hand.
Tip-ins
Raptors: Guard Norman Powell appeared to intentionally hit Kevin Love in the groin area, a play that could come under league review. Later, Powell was assessed a technical for jawing with Cavs guard Dahntay Jones, who was ejected ... Toronto's lone win in a playoff opener came in 2001 ... Casey said trying to devise a game plan to slow down James is almost impossible. "He's the hub of everything," he said. "He understands where everybody is. He's a quarterback. He's a point guard. He's a power forward. He's a small forward. He's a shooting guard. He's everything."
Cavaliers: James needs 25 points to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5,762 points) for second place on the league's all-time playoff scoring list, and two 3-pointers to join Ray Allen, Reggie Miller and Manu Ginobili as the only players to connect on 300 postseason 3s ... James has scored at least 30 points in 88 playoff games, tying Kobe Bryant for second on the career list. Only Michael Jordan (109) has more.

International toy retailer Toys "R" Us Inc is expected to open at least 30 to 40 stores annually in China, mostly in major cities while reaching more customers with its online stores.
Roy Sammartino, managing director of Toys "R" Us China, said: "China is our fastest-growing market with more store openings than anywhere else in the world."
Toys "R" Us had two online stores and 134 physical stores in 55 cities in China by the end of April. The retailer has 883 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and Guam, and 795 international stores and 254 licensed stores in 37 countries and regions.
Sammartino said due to the special nature of its business, where consumers want to touch the products, there has to be a mix of online and offline business to provide customers with the easiest way to shop.
The managing director launched the limited toy Redeco Optimus Prime from the Transformers 5: The Last Knight movie in Beijing and Guangzhou last week, with live streaming on its store on Tmall, the leading online shopping platform in China.

DUBLIN - Ireland on Tuesday published its strategy for the Brexit negotiations, saying that it will explore European Union (EU) measures to help minimize Brexit impact.
In the strategy, Ireland welcomed the outcome of the weekend's European Council meeting and the overall approach to the forthcoming Brexit negotiations set out in the guidelines.
Under the strategy, Ireland observed that discussions were under way with the European Investment Bank on the potential for increased investment in Ireland to back Ireland's ten-year capital investment program.
Ireland stressed its priorities as the Northern Ireland peace process and Good Friday Agreement, maintaining the Common Travel Area and minimizing the risks to Ireland's trade and economy, and no return to a hard border, according to the strategy.
The Common Travel Area is an open borders area comprising the Republic of Ireland and Britain.
Britain's withdrawal from the EU would effectively make the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border an external EU border. But both the Irish and UK governments have stated that they do not wish for a hard border between the two countries, taking into account the historical and social sensitivities that permeate the Island of Ireland.
The strategy stressed the rights of Irish citizens residing in the Northern Ireland, saying that they should continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens.
It said Brexit presents critical risks for Ireland's key sectors, including food, retail, tourism, fishing and energy.
According to the strategy, Ireland will intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit, and to pursue all possible opportunities that might arise.
It said Ireland will prepare a further paper on economic implications of the Brexit challenge.




At Saturday's summit, the leaders of the 27 remaining EU countries adopted unanimously the Brexit guidelines.
According to the Brexit guidelines, the EU, throughout the negotiations, will maintain unity and act as one with the aim of reaching a result that is "fair and equitable for all member states and in the interest of its citizens."
The two year timeframe of Brexit negotiations set out in Article 50 ends on March 29 of 2019.

The French presidential run-off will see self-proclaimed centrist Emmanuel Macron compete with far-right leader Marine Le Pen in less than one week. The first-round election result on April 23 came as a shock to many French voters, because for the first time in more than half a century no candidate from an established party made it to the second round.
Macron led the poll with 23.8 percent of the votes while Le Pen won 21.5 percent. Neither Francois Fillon, a conservative and former prime minister, nor leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon could win more than 20 percent of the votes. Senior politicians, including Fillon, the defeated Republican candidate, were quick to voice their support for Macron in the run-off on May 7.
The highly charged campaign and the absence of "mainstream" candidates signal an unprecedented change in French politics. It was almost unlikely that any of the 11 French presidential candidates would secure 50 percent of the votes in the first round. But in what has rarely been seen, Macron won against his three closest rivals by only a small margin in the first round, and the traditional left- and right-wing candidates lost to a self-proclaimed centrist whose party was founded just a year ago and a far-right leader who is dead set against globalization.
The 2012 elections saw current President Francois Hollande beat Le Pen by more than 10 percent votes before going head-to-head against then president Nicolas Sarkozy. And that has often been the case in the past elections, which saw either a Socialist or Republican candidate holding a decisive sway.
That many French voters chose extreme right and independent leaders over established party leaders, to some extent, indicates that populism and extremist political tendencies are not to be overlooked in the country. Plus, Macron's narrow win offers a glimpse into the widening divisions among French citizens.
These political changes will be felt by the European Union, too. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker congratulated Macron on his first-round victory, for good reason, as the 39-year-old centrist has not only vowed to keep France in the EU but also vowed to take measures to boost Europe's economy.
Le Pen, on the other hand, believes economic globalization could put French civilization in danger, and has said she would consider pulling out of the EU and abolishing the euro if elected to the highest office. These seemingly wild pledges did offer another option to a number of French voters who have grown increasingly impatient with the current establishment. Notwithstanding that reality, Le Pen's election will inject more uncertainty into Europe.
Seen on larger canvas, the French presidential election could once again put globalization at a historic crossroad. Although both are known as "anti-establishment", Macron is in favor of free trade and controlled immigration, and urges France to play a pivotal role in Europe, while Le Pen emphasizes the need to protect domestic enterprises from competition. One way or the other, a turning point for France and the EU will emerge in less than one week.

Chinese media owners, especially the internet ones, are quickly catching up with their international counterparts in terms of advertising income.
According to the Top 30 Global Media Owners report released by return-on-investment agency Zenith, Shenzhen-based Tencent Holdings Ltd saw its advertising revenue soar 697 percent between 2012 and 2016, coming only second to Twitter Inc's 734 percent growth and dislodging Facebook Inc. Search engine Baidu Inc's advertising income grew 190 percent during the period.
Zenith has been publishing the list since 2007. The list this year is based only on media owners' advertising revenue, excluding revenues from all other activities.
Three Chinese media owners entered the top 30 list, including Baidu, Tencent and China Central Television, which came in fourth, 14th and 20th, respectively. With that, China claimed the second-biggest number of media owners in the ranking, only second to the United States.
The United States dominates the list, with 20 of the companies. Google Inc's parent company Alphabet Inc, together with Facebook, took the first two positions.
Global internet advertising is seen growing 13 percent to reach $205 billion in 2017, taking up 36.9 percent of all advertising expenditure.
Social media advertising is the fastest-growing component of internet advertising, increasing by 51 percent in 2016.
Jonathan Barnard, head of forecasting at Zenith, said that the internet advertising platforms were actually "setting the pace for global adspend growth" at present.
Chinese media owners are pacing the global trend, with two of the three companies included in the ranking being internet companies.

PARIS - Two thirds of hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon's supporters refused to back centrist Emmanuel Macron in his bid to govern France for the next five years, his party staff announced Tuesday.
The anti-capitalist "France Unbowed" movement, whose representative in the presidential election (Melenchon) failed to pass to the second round of voting, launched a "refusal of what's happening," said Charlotte Girard, co-head of the hard-left party's program.
Its results showed that only a third of the party's members said they would endorse Macron in a second round compared to 36.1 percent who said they would cast blank vote and 29.05 percent who said they would abstain from voting.
"Casting a blank vote or abstaining are a way to say 'no' to the National Front, but also to say that the Macron option is not desirable," she added.
On April 23, Melenchon won 19.58 percent of the first round of votes, failing to make it to the run-off despite reporting spectacular public support days before the election officially kicked off.
During the campaign, he was a harsh critic of Macron's liberal economic project and Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration policy. However, he proposed a similar protectionist approach involving an exit from the eurozone and refused to endorse either of the top two candidates.
A poll released earlier on Tuesday predicted Macron would win the French presidency, despite having lost ground to his rival Le Pen, the leader of the National Front Party.
On May 7, the former economy minister is expected to defeat Le Pen with 59 percent of the votes to her 41 percent, according to Elabe survey for BFMTV news channel and L'Express magazine.
Five days ahead of the decisive round of the French presidential elections, Macron lost five percentage points compared to a poll conducted on April 24.
A total of 18 percent of 3,956 respondents said they were sure to head to the polling station on Sunday; but they were still undecided as to which candidate to vote for.

Firefighters battle a blaze in the Greater Hinggan Mountains in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region on Tuesday.Zhang Shaolin / For China Daily
A second big fire broke out in China's largest forest in the Greater Hinggan Mountains on the same day a cross-border fire from Russia was extinguished.
The fire broke out at 12:15 pm on Tuesday in the Beidahe forest in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. More than 8,300 firefighters are working to extinguish the blaze, according to regional fire authorities.
By press time, the fire had engulfed about 50 square kilometers of forest. The firefighters - 2,590 of whom are armed police officers - and 12 helicopters have been sent.
Strong winds, mountainous terrain, and dry vegetation made the firefighting "extremely difficult", according to an official statement from the fire authorities.
The blaze was thought to be caused by a stoker employed at a forestry station who improperly disposed of ashes and other residue from a fire. The suspect is in custody, the State Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters said.
Wang Haizhong, deputy director of the general office of the headquarters, warned that over the next 10 days China will face an increasing risk of forest fires due to an expected rise in temperatures across the nation.
Wang was quoted in a Xinhua interview as saying that China still lags behind developed countries in terms of investment in forest fire prevention.
In some poorly prepared western provinces, he said, the expenditure on fire prevention was less than 10 cents per hectare of forest, while in the United States and Canada it can reach $2 per hectare.
The temperature in Inner Mongolia this spring is higher than in previous years, posing a higher fire risk for the region's forests.
A cross-border fire broke out Sunday in another area. That fire was put out on Tuesday and cleanup is underway.
Xinhua contributed to this story.








SEOUL - US Forces Korea has confirmed that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system deployed last week in the southeastern Republic of Korea is "operational".
The system has the ability to "intercept missiles" from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and "defend South Korea", USFK spokesman Rob Manning said on Tuesday.
Last week, about 20 US trucks and trailers carried THAAD components, including radar, to a golf course designated for the system in the village of Soseong-ri in Seongju county, North Gyeongsang province.
The installed components include two mobile launchers and an AN/TPY-2 radar. A complete THAAD battery is composed of six mobile launchers, 48 interceptors, radar and the fire and control unit.
The deployment of THAAD in the Republic of Korea has been strongly opposed by nearby countries, including China and Russia, as an element breaking strategic balance in the region.
In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the parties related in the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue should take responsibility and make a breakthrough to resume peace talks at an early date. Geng Shuang said at a daily press briefing on Tuesday that China has always believed that peaceful negotiation and consultation remain the only practical and feasible approach to realizing denuclearization, peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
On Monday, protesters blocked about 30 ROK police buses from entering, and they have continued to hold daily rallies in Soseong-ri. Three Buddhist monks whose holy ground is near the site, have started a hunger strike.

The poll, conducted by a Paris-based Chinese-language bi-monthly publication called Huarenjie, questioned 230 Chinese-French voters. It found that 61 percent of the respondents supported Macron, while only 24 percent went for Macron's rival Marine Le Pen.
French centrist politician Macron and the far-right former National Front leader Le Pen were the two leading candidates in the first round of the French presidential election. Voters must now decide between the two in a second-round vote on May 7.
The poll showed that immigration and economic policy are the major concerns among Chinese-French voters.
Known for her hard-line and populist comments on the European Union and immigration, Le Pen has powered her campaign by preserving a sense of national identity, deporting illegal immigrants and pushing back against globalization trends. And it was her stronger anti-immigration stance, particularly in the wake of terror attacks in Paris, that helped her win some support groups.
Some Chinese-French people fear that Le Pen's anti-globalization stance would cast a shadow on Chinese businesses and investment in France.
During the first-round vote, center-right candidate Francois Fillon was the favorite among the Chinese community as he pledged to reduce taxes on companies and boost economic growth. Fillion, however, grappling with a nepotism scandal, was knocked out in the first round vote.
The Chinese community welcome Macron's bid to solve France's economic problems through a series of reforms, according to Global Times.

The United Arab Emirates will never become a safe haven for criminals involved in corruption, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday as he described progress on extradition cooperation.
Wang and Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, co-chaired in Beijing the first meeting of the China-UAE Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee.
"I raised the issue of cooperation in the fight against corruption as well as the pursuit of fugitives and recovery of their assets with Minister Abdullah, and he responded very actively," Wang said.
"The UAE will never become a safe haven for any corrupt Chinese fugitive," he added.
Wang said both countries support trade, investment liberalization and facilitation and also advocate open and transparent regional free-trade arrangements.
"We will further step up coordination and cooperation so that we can conclude the substantive negotiations for the China-Gulf Cooperation Council free trade area at an early date," he said.
Regarding people-to-people exchanges, two-way visits exceeded 600,000 last year.
According to Abdullah, since the UAE implemented a visa-free policy for Chinese citizens in November, the number of Chinese tourists to the country has increased by 7 percent.
"The number of bilateral visits will probably be over 1 million this year and next," Wang said.
He also said that both countries are satisfied with the achievements in oil cooperation, and will accelerate oil and gas exploration, port construction as well as the development of port industrial parks.
"We also discussed bilateral cooperation in new areas such as nuclear energy and power, and the aerospace industry, which we both believe enjoy broad prospects and huge potential," he said.
Wang said China remains committed to the stability and development of the Middle East, and China has regarded the UAE as an important partner in maintaining stability in the Gulf region.
"Both sides will work together to push forward a political settlement of regional hot spot issues," he added.
Abdullah emphasized the UAE's strong commitment to the one-China policy and said his country looked forward to enhancing the relationship with China in all areas.
Zhu Weilie, an Arabic studies expert at Shanghai International Studies University, said the China-UAE relationship has been on the fast track in recent years, with the two countries working closely in areas such as oil and gas, production capacity and cultural exchanges.
"Since the UAE will host the World Expo in 2020, the Persian Gulf country could also borrow experience from Shanghai," he said.

A recent video showing a mixed martial arts fighter from Beijing knocking down a self-proclaimed tai chi master within seconds continued to score big on social media this week.
While the demonstration may be seen by some as a defeat for traditional martial arts as portrayed in movies, an expert said on Tuesday that the whole thing was a publicity stunt.
It all started with a personal grudge. Xu Xiaodong, a 38-year-old MMA coach and promoter, was angry with 41-year-old Wei Lei - head of the Lei style of tai chi - after Wei posted Xu's personal contact information online last year. Xu said that created a disturbance in his life.
Meanwhile, Xu frequently proclaimed in his online video shows that traditional martial arts are useless in real combat - provoking Wei, who challenged Xu to a duel in Chengdu, Sichuan province, in April.
Wei arrived in Chengdu last week to prepare for the fight, which was scheduled for Saturday. The fight, which took place in front of a crowd at the Yichan Club, was streamed live via Xu's social media account. It was stopped within 20 seconds, after Wei was knocked to the ground.
After the fight, Xu announced on social media that he would take on any master who wants to defend the honor of traditional martial arts, and would put up 1.2 million yuan ($174,000) in prize money. He said he will expose the fake martial arts masters.
"It was just a childish fight between two unfit amateurs and has nothing to do with the honor of MMA or traditional martial arts. It means nothing, no matter who wins," said Shao Shiwei, former deputy director of the Martial Arts Sports Management Center of General Administration of Sports.
He said he has never heard of Lei style tai chi or its chief. "There are many self-proclaimed martial arts masters in China who like to exaggerate the power of traditional martial arts just to make money," he said.
"The martial arts movies are very misleading, too. If traditional martial arts were developed to fight or kill others, it would have been banned a long time ago and wouldn't exist now."
Tai chi is proven to be effective for improving people's health, and helpful in getting over depression. Practicing martial arts should be a healthy lifestyle and never be used to hurt others, he said: "The fight is just a publicity stunt, which doesn't deserve attention from the public or media."
Several tai chi practitioners - including Chen Shou from Chenjiagou, Henan province, the birthplace of Chen style tai chi - say they will take Xu up on his challenge.
Modern tai chi emphasizes health, but it can also be powerful in practical combat, especially Chen style tai chi, Chen said.

Pittsburgh Penguins' Sidney Crosby takes a hit to the head from Washington Capitals' Matt Niskanen early in Monday's Game 3 of their NHL Eastern Conference semifinal in Pittsburgh. Crosby left the game and did not return. The Capitals won 3-2 in overtime. Gene J. Puskar / Ap
PITTSBURGH - A shot from the point by Washington Capitals defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk salvaged - or at the very least, extended - his team's season on Monday night.
A far different kind of shot might end up determining the outcome of the Caps' Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, which is growing more contentious by the shift.
Shattenkirk's goal 3:13 into overtime lifted Washington to a 3-2 victory, cutting Pittsburgh's series lead to 2-1.
A couple of hours earlier, Sidney Crosby, the Penguins' superstar captain, left the game after just five minutes after taking a cross-check to the head from Washington's Matt Niskanen.
The NHL's leading goal scorer did not return and his status for Wednesday's Game 4 - and maybe the rest of the postseason - is uncertain.
"I certainly didn't mean to injure him," said Niskanen, who spent four years with Crosby in Pittsburgh before signing with Washington in 2014. "It's an unfortunate play that happened really quick."
Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said Crosby will be evaluated on Tuesday. Even without Crosby, Pittsburgh pushed Washington to the limit. Evgeni Malkin and Justin Schultz scored in a 48-second span with less than two minutes left in regulation to force overtime.
For once Washington, a 43-year-old franchise with a long history of playoff collapses, dominated the extra period before Shattenkirk's fired a shot past Marc-Andre Fleury's blocker to send his teammates pouring over the boards in celebration.
"Tonight was a great test for all of us," said Shattenkirk, who played miserably during a blowout loss in Game 2.
"There were a lot of different moments in the game where we had to see what we were made of."
One frightening moment, however, will resonate above all others.
The game was scoreless early in the first period when Crosby skated just outside the Capitals' crease. Washington's Alex Ovechkin slashed Crosby along the upper body and Crosby slid awkwardly trying to maintain his balance when he collided with Niskanen, who had his stick raised.
The stick caught Crosby flush across the mouth and the two-time MVP was stretched out on the ice in pain for several moments before slowly skating off under his own power as Pittsburgh trainers searched for his teeth.
Niskanen earned a major penalty for cross-checking and was given a game misconduct. Washington coach Barry Trotz called it "a hockey play." Niskanen conceded that it looked "really bad" when he caught the replay, but stressed there was no malicious intent.
His former teammates weren't buying it.
"It's one of those things you look at it once, you see what actually happened and the next thing is watching how deliberate it was when the guy cross-checks him in the face," Pittsburgh forward Chris Kunitz said. "I thought all of that was kind of out of this league, but I guess not."
This wasn't the first time Crosby took an ugly shot to the head from a Capital.
Crosby was in the middle of an MVP run on Jan., 1, 2011, when he took an elbow to the head from Washington's David Steckel during the Winter Classic, leading to a concussion that cost Crosby the better part of two years in his prime as he struggled to recover.
Their captain gone for the rest of the game and perhaps longer, the Penguins appeared momentarily dazed as they tried to regroup.

Members of Acrush, a Chinese all-girl band, pose for pictures before a rehearsal at a dance studio in Beijing last month. THOMAS PETER/REUTERS
Fast-forward to now: The 23-year-old is a member of Acrush, China's first boyish all-girl band, which released its debut single last week. The boyish band already has hundreds of thousands of fans－more than 749,000 followers on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like service.
"Our fathers' generation still holds the idea that girls should dress in a feminine manner, something I was never comfortable with," Min said. "I just like to dress in a unisex way."
Min didn't expect to be picked for the band when she auditioned last year. But her boyish outlook and androgynous style were exactly what Tencent-backed entertainment startup Zhejiang Huati Culture Communication was looking for.
Marketed as a pop band that encourages girls to pursue their own identities and shake up female conventions, Acrush cuts against the grain in China's music industry, where girl bands are marketed as sweet young things to appeal to males.
"I left home when I was young," said Acrush lead singer Peng Xichen, 21. "To comfort my parents, I told them my boyish outlook would keep me safe."
From day one, Zhejiang Huati created individual identities for the women. Min is supposed to be the band's comedian, while Peng is a "gentle romantic". The 21-year-old Lu is styled as an energetic dancer with a sunny disposition.
Lu wears long-sleeved outfits to prevent the public from seeing a dragon tattoo on her arm. She says only: "I did it when I was an ignorant girl."
But she did admit to sometimes dressing in pink and behaving like a child.
The Chinese blogosphere is ablaze with questions about Acrush's leanings. Asked if they support feminism and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, band members claim they have no idea what LGBT means.
"We're just handsome girls," Min said.

China National Petroleum Corp, the country's largest oil and gas producer, has pumped the first crude oil through the China-Myanmar oil pipeline and the oil is expected to arrive in China within three weeks, the energy giant said on Wednesday.
Around 1,150 cubic meters per hour of crude began flowing into the pipeline on Tuesday, CNPC said in a statement.
The pipeline is the latest energy cooperation between the two countries, and helps ensure China's energy diversification, the company said.
The pipeline extends for 771 kilometers in Myanmar and 1,600 kilometers in China, starting in Myanmar's Made Island and ending in Yunnan province.
In April, the first oil tanker, Suezmax, offloaded 140,000 tons of crude at Made Island oil port, the starting point of the pipeline.
Zhang Yong, deputy director of CNPC Southeast Asia Pipeline Co Ltd, said the first crude oil will be delivered to a new refinery in Ruili, a city in Yunnan province, within 20 days.
Zhang Guobao, former director of the National Energy Administration, said the pipeline will further enhance the country's energy security.
The project, together with the China-Russia crude oil pipelines and the China-Kazakhstan oil pipeline, will also ensure oil import diversification, he added.
Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, said with the new pipeline, China's oil and gas imports will no longer have to pass through the Malacca Straits, a narrow channel that connects the Indian Ocean with the Pacific Ocean.
The security of pipeline transmission is much greater than that of shipments by sea, and the pipeline will ensure a stable energy supply to China, she added.
Fan Wenzhi displays his diaries at his home in Harbin, Heilongjiang province.Photos By Liu Yang / For China Daily
Every time his family members reunite in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province, retired teacher Fan Wenzhi tells them stories about his past.
However, the 84-year-old has age-related memory loss and has to refer to his plethora of diaries - since 1953, Fan has written a total of nearly 4 million words in 60 diaries.
"In my diaries, I write about daily life as well as commenting on social, political and economic issues," he said. "No matter how late I sleep, I always write a diary entry before going to bed."
Sixty-four years ago, Fan began studying at Mudanjiang Normal School. To this day, he remains grateful for the opportunity he had to get an education.
"I was born into a poor family in a village. Nobody could read or write in my family," he said. "Fortunately, my parents appreciated the importance of education, so they made every effort to send me to school after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949."
Fan was 16 at the time, and following four years at primary school, he was able to continue his education at the normal school.
"I knew very little about diaries until our Chinese teacher advised us to write a diary entry every day to improve our writing skills," he said. "It was something I enjoyed, and it soon became a daily habit."
Fan has kept a diary ever since, writing entries even when he is sick or travels to other cities.
"Through the habit, I fell in love with Chinese literature, and I became a Chinese teacher after I graduated," he said.
"Knowledge changed my life. So I made sure my children also understood the importance of education."
Two of his three children have college degrees and one has a postgraduate degree.
Fan's diaries have recorded how the world around him has changed during his life.
"When I read my diary entry from the Spring Festival in 1957 to my grandchildren, they could not relate to it," he said. "At that time, we simply celebrated the Spring Festival by eating dumplings, which seems so boring to them.
"Quality of life has improved since then. Now, we go to restaurants for dinner during Spring Festival. Delicious food is no longer rare. We eat fresh mango in the winter, but we didn't even know what mango was when I was young."
Over the years, the family has moved home seven times, upgrading from a 6-square-meter home to an 80-square-meter apartment, the details of which are all recorded in Fan's diaries.
"In the 1980s, there were seven people living in our 30-square-meter apartment, which was much too crowded," he said. "Now I have my own room to read and write. My wife and I can do what we like without disturbing each other."
Fan has arranged his diaries in chronological order to make it easier to look back over his memories.
"As I get older, my memories fade, so I often read my diaries in my spare time," he said. "It helps me to relive memories and brings me happiness."
Reading diaries is a method of self-reflection, he said.
"I enjoy immersing myself in the diaries, as they document experiences and give me inspiration. I will continue to write entries on a daily basis," he said. "I also hope the diaries can be passed down from generation to generation as a record of our family history."

BEIJING -- Two centers for foreigner exit and entry services opened Tuesday in Beijing to assist foreign talent in service industries.
The centers in Chaoyang and Shunyi districts will accept applications for permanent stays, long-term visas and port visas for foreign elites in the service sector, foreigner members of startups, Chinese with foreign nationality and young foreign students.
Shen Jinsheng, deputy director of Beijing Municipal Commission of Commerce, said the commission would issue recommendation letters for those working in the two districts who passed in a grading before applying for permanent stay.
The new service centers will shorten the period to apply for a permanent stay from 180 to 90 working days.
Many foreigners live in Chaoyang where most embassies and many international agencies and chambers of commerce are located. Shunyi, home to Beijing Capital International Airport, has over 100 international companies and a foreign population of around 8,000.
Li Kai On, a Chinese with British nationality, said he had applied for a permanent stay as he, a teacher at an international school, had seen opportunities in Beijing's education sector.
"I hope with the new measures, I can become a real Chinese in a short time."

UNITED NATIONS - The UN special envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura will join the high-level meeting on Syria in Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan, on May 3-4, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters here Tuesday.
"In view of the urgency and importance of re-establishing a de-escalation of the situation in Syria and moving on confidence-building measures, he has agreed to attend the meeting as an observer at the invitation of the Kazakh government," Dujarric said at a daily news briefing here.
While in Astana, the special envoy will be supporting efforts by the guarantors of the ceasefire and other participants to de-escalate the military situation, he said. "He will be accompanied by a technical delegation of UN experts who have been present in previous Astana meetings."
De Mistura will also use the opportunity to conduct political consultations with the ceasefire guarantors and others that will be present, the spokesman said. "This will be particularly timely as he is at present putting finishing touches on his deliberations regarding the next round of intra-Syrian talks in Geneva."
The upcoming talks will be the fourth international conference on Syria, where a political crisis broke out in March 2011 and developed into a civil war.
The third round of the Syria talks was held in Astana on March 14-15. Representatives of Russia, Iran and Turkey, which had brokered a nationwide ceasefire in Syria, took part in the negotiations alongside the Syrian government delegation and experts from the United Nations, United States and Jordan.




 
SHANGHAI -- Aged just two and a half, Wu Rui follows her mother to work every morning, joining her peers in day care while her mother works in an office a few paces away.
Zhang Yi and her daughter have followed a similar schedule almost every week-day for a year, using the same day care center.
Before the center was launched last April, baby-sitting was a headache for Zhang, a computing engineer with Ctrip, a Shanghai-based travel service.
"Very few nurseries accept children under three, and even if they do the children are dismissed at 3 or 4 p.m. when parents are still busy at work," she said. "As a result, most toddlers stay home with grandparents. But when they are ill or out of the city, baby-sitting becomes a big problem."
Last year, her company began to offer day care for employees' children aged from 18 months to three years. From 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., the children are tended by nurses and teachers, served meals, told stories and enjoy outdoor activities.
"The center also helps tend older children, including primary school students who finish class early and need to wait for their parents to take them home," said Qian Kun, head of the day care center.
"The center now provides services for 100 children, and the oldest are in grade three," she said.
"This is really the best baby-sitting approach," Zhang said. "When I am tired at work in the middle of the day, I steal a look at the photos and video the teachers share in our WeChat group. My daughter's smiling face is such a relief."
Since March 11, several other day care centers were established in Shanghai's office buildings, industrial parks and large companies, a move requested by the city's federation of trade unions, to help working mothers stay in their jobs. The number will expand to 50 before the end of the year.
A 2016 survey by the federation and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences found that 80 percent of women of child-bearing age were unwilling to have a second child, mainly because no one in their families was available to baby-sit.
"I hope Beijing will follow suit," said Wang Yan, who works for a Hong Kong-invested company and is expecting her second child in September.
Wang, 37, remembers going to work with her mother as a toddler. "The nursery was run by my mom's factory in downtown Beijing and was close to her workshop," she said. "Mom said I began attending nursery when I was three months old, but she never felt miserable: we were so close to each other all the time."

Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery (ZMJ) has teamed up with private equity firm China Renaissance Capital Investment to buy part of German auto parts giant Robert Bosch's business, in a 545 million euro (4.11 billion yuan) deal.
The acquisition of Bosch's starters and generator unit, SG Holding, will enable ZMJ to tap into its technology and research capability, customer base and established global sales network, the coal mining and excavating equipment maker said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday evening.
Such a major move comes as China vows to further slash coal production capacity by at least 150 million tons this year to tackle environmental problems. The country cut 290 million tons in 2016.
"The fourth quarter of 2016 saw short-term warming of the coal industry. However, the condition of excessive supply of the coal market did not change fundamentally," chairman of ZMJ Jiao Chengyao said in the company's annual report.
ZMJ will take at least an 86 percent stake in SG Holding under the agreement. The company expects to fund no more than 440 million euros through internal resources while the remainder would be funded through external bank financing.
The valuation is in line with comparable companies but lower than the overall level of precedent transactions, the statement noted. The starter motors and generators division reported a net asset value of 323 million euros and a net after-tax profit of 2 million euros in 2016.
The deal is also expected to boost SG's presence in China, the world's largest auto market.
Robert Bosch is a multinational engineering and electronics company, with core products including automotive components, industrial products and building products.
Established over half a century ago, ZMJ is a leading company, with exports to Australia and the US. The company reported a net profit of 62 million yuan in 2016, increasing 46.9 percent year-on-year.
More than 8,300 firefighters have been mobilized to fight a forest fire that broke out in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region at around midday on Tuesday, authorities said on Wednesday.
The wildfire, which broke out in Beidahe forest in the Greater Hinggan Mountains, had engulfed about 5,000 hectares by Wednesday morning, according to the regional forest fire prevention headquarters.
Dry vegetation, strong winds and temperatures of up to 29 C had made it difficult to extinguish the blaze, the headquarters said.
The State Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters dispatched 12 firefighting airplanes, while preparations for precipitation enhancement have been completed to aid efforts in bringing the flames under control.
The cause of the blaze is unknown, but higher than average temperatures this spring have increased the risk of fires.
A fire in another forest in the area raged for three days and spread across the border into Russia before being put out on Tuesday.


A book outlining the history of tribunals for accused Japanese war criminals, and its far-reaching impact, made its debut in Shanghai on Tuesday.

The Tokyo Trial: For World Peace, showcases the latest viewpoints and evidence collected by researchers in China, Japan and the West, said Cheng Zhaoqi, the book's author and director of Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Center for the Tokyo Trial Studies.

"We present the readers with a more substantial and objective legal basis of the whole process, from the establishment of the court and the disputes over jurisdiction to the court trials and the discussion of sentencing and measurement of penalties," he said.



The book will be translated into eight languages, including Japanese.

On May 3, 1946, the post-World War II trials, known as the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, began in Tokyo. The tribunal was active until Nov 12, 1948.

As an initiative to implement the Cairo Declaration - a 1943 statement by China, Britain and the United States setting postwar goals - the tribunal followed the model of the Nuremberg trials. Japanese leaders were tried for conspiracy to start and wage war; atrocities against humanity; and planning, authorizing or failing to prevent transgressions by commanders.

Officials in Japan have repeatedly tried to overthrow the result of the Tokyo Trial and sometimes call it "the trial of the victors", Cheng said, adding that more books denying the event than respecting it are in Japanese bookstores.

"Their ultimate purpose is to deny the Tokyo Trial and thus overthrow the international community's judgment of Japan's aggression and atrocities. Therefore, it is imperative to recognize the achievements of the Tokyo Trial, and China must air a voice of justice," Cheng said.

The trials in Tokyo and Nuremberg were not "trials of the victors" but of civilization and justice, said Wang Xin, a law professor at Peking University.

"The fundamental purpose of the trials was not revenge or punishment but long-term international peace and stability - so countries can achieve a real reconciliation," he said.

The highly readable book, with pictures and illustrations, is also good for the public, especially younger generations, to learn about history, said Xiang Longwan, son of Xiang Zhejun, who was among the Tokyo Trial prosecutors.

SHANGHAI -- The maiden flight of the C919, China's first domestically-built large passenger jet, is scheduled for May 5, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) said Wednesday.
The flight will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport.
"If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said.
The C919, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, signals the country's entry into the global aviation market as a strong competitor, analysts said.
In 2007, plans to develop a Chinese-built large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line.
"Engineers have completed over 118 tests and are prepared for the maiden flight," COMAC said. The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March. It has 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers.
COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China's national carrier Air China, and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service.

First US-based research center to be led by former Microsoft scientist
Chinese internet titan Tencent Holdings Ltd said it is gearing up its expansion in the artificial intelligence sector, seeing the red hot field as the next frontier of growth and innovation in the internet industry.
Tencent, the tech giant best known for its WeChat messaging service and gaming, announced on Tuesday that it will open its first US-based AI research lab in Seattle, which will be led by former Microsoft scientist Yu Dong.
Yu Dong, appointed as deputy director of Tecent's AI Lab division, will run the new facility and is expected to drive the fundamental research on speech recognition and natural language understanding, the company announced.
Before joining Tencent, Yu was the principal researcher at the Microsoft Speech and Dialog Group and an adjunct professor of Zhejiang University.
"We hope the AI lab will not only be a laboratory, but also a connector to bring together the world's leading talent," said Zhang Tong, the newly appointed director of Tencent's core AI Lab and the former big data director at Baidu Inc.
Lu Yanxia, research manager at IDC China, said the new lab will help Tencent to lure top international staff and have better access to the world's leading AI technologies, currently dominated by the US.
"The move shows that the company is betting big on the hottest area of technology and innovation: AI," Lu said.
"It will help the company to create new momentum in its key market."
By opening the new lab, Shenzhen-headquartered Tencent joins the army of Chinese tech powerhouses－including Baidu Inc and Didi Chuxing－in their quest to attract global talent to the booming AI sector.
Baidu was the first among Chinese tech giants to open an AI lab in Silicon Valley in 2014. In March, Baidu reportedly launched its second AI lab in Silicon Valley, right after Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing opened its first AI facility in the same area.
Lu said although Tencent's arrival to the AI sector was relatively late compared with its rivals, it was catching up fast by increasing investment, including the appointment of Yu Dong and the newly established AI lab in Seattle.
"The competition will be fiercer as more tech powerhouses gear up in the AI rush," Lu added.
Tencent set up its core AI Lab in April 2016, dedicated to providing AI technical support for Tencent products and services.
The Shenzhen-based lab currently has more than 50 researchers and over 200 engineers, according to the company.
Some six in 10 Chinese parents tell their children to fight back when bullied, according to a report in Chengdu Economic Daily.
A kindergarten in Leshan City in the southwestern province of Sichuan conducted a survey among 35 parents to find their reaction to school bullies.
About 60 percent said they emphasized training their children to be tough, while 25 percent suggested their kids stay away from those who bully others rather than answering violence with violence.
Local resident Wu Ping said her 5-year-old son met bullies in kindergarten and his grandfather urged him to fight back. She disagreed with that way of coping, but also worried her son might become a coward.
Yang Jiao, who organized the survey, said 90 percent of parents reported their children brawled with others or were bullied at school. But it also showed 9 percent of parents admitted hitting their children often and 86 percent only occasionally. Thirty-four percent of parents fought with each other in front of their kids.
Xiong Bingqi, an educational expert, urged parents to not advocate violence against violence because it's possible that a child may become aggressive in later stages of life.
But the wide range of international participation is setting it apart from China's existing financing powerhouses
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has been in business for more than a year now, after a 15 month participatory process. Besides speculation regarding participation in the fund, it also might not be clear to somewhat the bank set out to do and to what extent it will become a viable competitor in the extant global economic and finance order.
Somehow, the establishment of the AIIB is juxtaposed with the China-led Belt and Road Initiative, with similarities in their emphasis on infrastructure investment and their involvement with a large number of countries, particularly in Asia and Europe. In this sense, the AIIB is somehow considered to be a part of China's endeavor to go global and command increasing international influence.
Before one focuses on the potential geopolitical implications of the AIIB, it is probably worthwhile to focus on its economic and finance mission. Consistent with the message delivered in the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhe jiang province, last autumn, there is increasing consensus that the global economy is gradually gravitating toward a low growth era, in which traditional monetary policy can no longer deliver the much-needed growth that it did during the past couple of decades.
Consequently, global leaders agree that countries should adopt more active fiscal policies to stimulate their respective economies. Given the lack of infrastructure inmost developing countries and the lagging infrastructure in some developed economies, how to stimulate the economy through infrastructure investment a recipe for China's fast economic growth miracle so far-seems to be a trillion dollar solution for the global economy.
However, given the European debt crisis and the US fiscal cliff, both after the 2008 global financial crisis, funding for infrastructure by sovereign governments becomes ever less attainable. On the other hand, international organizations, such as the World Bank, International Finance Corp and the International Monetary Fund, are facing their own battle to reform their respective governance and investment philosophy, and they do not have the necessary resources to support another big wave of infrastructure investment.
The AIIB was probably conceived under this grand scheme of setting up a new and alternative financing vehicle through which investment in infrastructure projects, especially in Asian and developing countries, could become possible. The wide range of participation from not only Asian countries probably attests to the validity of the idea around the world.
More important, the broad representation by different countries on the bank's board and senior management team dispels some concerns over whether the AIIB will become yet another investment arm of China's international expansion. However, it should have become clear by now that the AIIB is totally different from China's own international investment and financing powerhouses.
With increasingly tight control over capital flow, even these national players are having a difficult time in deploying their capital overseas, which makes the AIIB and other international organizations led by China valuable complements to China's domestic financial institutions.
The AIIB, on the other hand, has a very clear mandate for using international capital to finance investment in international infrastructure projects. Not only that, but the AIIB is also committed to adopting international best practices in its governance, management and risk management practices. Furthermore, it has already employed and is in the process of employing even more people from all of the world, which again makes it an organization that is different from any other existing domestic player in China.
Of course, this is not to say that the AIIB does not have the long-term ambition of becoming another World Bank or Asian Development Bank one day, or of playing a greater role in the international economic and finance arena. With China's sustainable economic growth and increasing wealth, it is only natural and expected that China would have increasing influence in global matters, through economic and political channels, with the help of international organizations.
That said, given the AIIB's size, current stage of development and China's own economic transformation, it will take a while before the AIIB can become a very impactful player in the new global economical and finance order. One should not forget how much time, effort and negotiation it has taken the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to reach their current stages of operation and, even for them, it has become increasingly challenging to find financially viable and economically instrumental projects in the ever changing world economy.

The Chinese government has publicized a draft ordinance promoting "reading for all", to solicit public opinion, a move to create better reading habits among the population.
Realizing the importance of reading in national strength, China has gradually raised "reading for all" as a national strategy.
The call for a love of reading among all the population appeared in an array of important government and Communist Party of China (CPC) documents, including the report at the 18th CPC national congress and the government work reports delivered at the annual parliamentary session over the past four years.
There are still problems, however, which need to be resolved with the legislation, such as a lower reading rate compared with the world's major countries, inadequate and inequitable public resources, and mixed quality of reading materials.
A national survey by the Chinese Academy of Press and Publication showed that Chinese read 3.26 e-books and 4.58 paper books on average in 2015, compared with an average of 16 books in Europe and the United States.
Many major developed countries have already resorted to legislation to boost reading.
The United States introduced the Reading Excellence Act in 1998 and the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002. The Republic of Korea and Japan have also introduced laws to promote reading.
The draft ordinance, released by the Legislative Affairs Office of China's State Council, states that governments at or above county level should incorporate reading programs into their economic and social development plan, as well as their annual budget.
It encourages schools and academies to open their libraries to the public, and calls on brick-and-mortar bookstores to reserve reading space and organized reading for customers.
In addition, poor, remote and border regions, as well as those inhabited mainly by ethnic minority groups are expected to get special support under the draft.
With more funds, more libraries are now available, and the law should breathe life into the nation's reading habits.




 
"Observing the colour, smelling the odor and tasting the flavor are three steps to taste a wine in a nutshell," Gao, a senior wine taster with Anhui Yingjia Distillery Co, a well-known winery in the East China's Anhui province, reveals one of her know-hows to China Daily.
Though in her 40s, Gao's gentle voice suddenly perks up like a young woman as soon as she talks about wine, with a big smile spreading across her face.
"Wine making and tasting is the kind of job that needs a happy state of mind in the first place," she says. "Otherwise, the wine would taste differently."
It's hard to tell whether Gao was born to be a wine taster due to her mild temperament or it is the pleasure of the work that has made her so easygoing and content.
"It's a job that demands patience as well," Gao adds, citing an example that she once spent a whole week deliberating a formula.
Every other day in the afternoon, Gao goes to the factory, opens the lids of wine jars weighing 500 kilograms each, scoops one small cup, tastes, and then grades the wine.
The number of wine jars that she grades is usually between 70 and 80, and the whole process takes at least three hours.
For each sip, Gao downs one third of the wine and spits out the rest. "This way, I can judge the wines without getting drunk."
But the job has its side effects. She has started developing stomach problems. "My tongue often gets numb and I feel nausea", Gao says.
But the health issues have never stopped her.

New measures have been announced that will require government offices, restaurants and businesses in 46 major cities to sort and separate all household trash, including hazardous waste, kitchen leftovers and recyclable materials, by 2020.
The aim is to reduce the environmental risks posed by growing piles of waste in landfills and public places.
By the end of the year, the cities will be required to issue plans listing the types of waste they will deal with, and formulate plans for transportation and processing, according to Feng Liang, a senior official for resource conservation and environmental protection at the National Development and Reform Commission.
By the end of the decade, the recycling rate for household waste will have risen to at least 35 percent of the national total, he said. The commission, China's top economic planner, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development have issued the action plan to achieve the target.
The move has been warmly welcomed by environmental experts, businesses and other commentators because it is the first time mandatory regulations on the disposal of household trash have been levied at the national level. That illustrates the government's commitment to improving the situation, they said.
Implementation concerns
However, some observers have expressed doubts about the plan's implementation. Measures to encourage the sorting and separation of waste were first introduced 16 years ago, but progress has been slow.
They pointed to the fact that only government buildings, schools and businesses, such as restaurants and shopping malls, will be legally obliged to follow the plan, while citizens and households will just be encouraged to follow suit.
The plan lists various types of household trash: hazardous waste, such as used batteries, expired medicines and paints; recyclables, including bottles, cans, clothing and paper; and kitchen waste, such as vegetable peelings and other discarded organic material.
It will cover China's four municipalities - Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing - several tier-one cities, every provincial and regional capital, and smaller cities designated as models for waste treatment, such as Handan, Hebei province.
"It's a systematic program to sort all trash. It will take time, but it's a good idea to start with businesses and government buildings. That familiarity will make the plan more effective and easier to promote in residential communities," said Xu Haiyun, chief engineer at the China Urban Construction Design and Research Institute.
China officially launches its second -- and the first domestically developed -- aircraft carrier on Apr 26, 2017, in Dalian, Liaoning province. [Photo/Xinhua]
China officially launched its second -- and the first domestically developed -- aircraft carrier on Wednesday morning in Dalian, Liaoning province.
The ship is the largest and most sophisticated surface vessel China has ever built.
General Fan Changlong, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, took part in the launch ceremony at a shipyard in the northeastern coastal city. Fan's presence indicates the significance Chinese leaders attach to the colossal ship because only the most important equipment for the PLA would have top-level officers at the public debut ceremony.
The new carrier's name and hull code remain unknown as the Navy usually makes public such information when a ship is commissioned.
Currently, the PLA Navy operates a sole aircraft carrier, CNS Liaoning, which was originally a Soviet-era vessel and received an extensive refit at the same shipyard in Dalian, where the new carrier is being constructed, before going into service in September 2012.
The new carrier has been designed in China, according to a news release published by the military after the ceremony.
In the next phase, the carrier will start the outfitting process, the news release said. During the outfitting stage, engineers and workers will complete the installation of the ship's power plant, engines, interior equipment and systems as well as weapons.
Beside China, six countries operate a total of 16 aircraft carriers. The United States is the largest operator as it now runs 10 Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carriers with each having a full-load displacement of about 100,000 tons.
China is now capable of building the world's first underwater vacuum tube train, a futuristic form of transportation that can achieve supersonic speed and reduce airborne noise, according to Chinese academics and scholars.
"In order to build an underwater vacuum tunnel, China must bring forth new ideas...about submerged floating tunnels, maglev trains and vacuum techniques. Currently, the country's technologies are sufficient to carry out such a program," Sun Jun, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Science and Technology Daily.
The vacuum tube train is a magnetic levitation line that utilizes evacuated tubes or tunnels. Due to reduced air resistance, the train could hit a theoretical speed of 2,000 kilometers per hour using relatively little power, and its operation would not be affected by weather.
The China Railway Tunnel Survey & Design Institute has finished a tentative research survey on the possibility of building a 10-kilometer underwater vacuum tunnel in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province. Once built, it would become China's longest underwater tunnel, as well as the world's first underwater vacuum tunnel, cutting the travel time between Fujian and Taipei - located 180 kilometers apart - to just 13 minutes.
The program has been welcomed by many scholars and experts, who note that China has built over 500 underwater tunnels over the past 20 years, gaining rich experience and refined technologies. Sun, along with two other academicians, has called for Chinese authorities to approve and support the program.
A group of Chinese scientists have invented a reagent test kit which can diagnose multiple kinds of cancer by analyzing a drop of human blood. [Photo/CGTN]
Scientists around the world are striving for effective detection of cancer in the early stages, and a Chinese scientist may have found a quick way of knowing whether malignant tumors exist in a patient's body, with just one drop of blood.
Luo Yongzhang and his team in Tsinghua University's School of Life Sciences in Beijing have successfully invented a reagent test kit of Hsp90α for clinical use, which can diagnose multiple kinds of cancer by analyzing a drop of human blood.
Malignant tumors in early phases can be cured but once they have spread all over the patient's body there is no way to save the person's life.
However, it's extremely difficult to be aware of cancer in its early stages, as patients don't show obvious symptoms and thus it can only be found in its later stages, which is already too late, so to detect cancer early remains a global challenge for scientists.
Back in 1989, scientists have found a kind of heat shock proteins (HSP), named Hsp90α, which existed in human bodies and can be used as a cancer biomarker detection kit.
Scientists around the globe have been working on it since then, and more than 10,000 journals have been published on accredited magazines, yet no one has actually turned their research results into medical products.
However, Luo and his team seemed to have cracked the code, after working on the problem since 2009. The team has produced an artificial Hsp90α protein that gains structural stability by regrouping proteins. This means they are able to "create" the protein, in any quantity, and at any time they wish to.
The kit has since been used in clinical trials involving 2,347 patients at eight hospitals in China. It was the first clinical trial in the world to test if the protein could be a useful tumor biomarker for lung cancer, and it succeeded.
Now, the kit has been certified to enter the Chinese and European markets, 24 years after Hsp90α was discovered.
Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.
In 2015, about 90.5 million people had cancer in the world, with roughly 14.1 million new cases occurring each year. Approximately 8.8 million human deaths, or 15.7 percent of all deaths in the world, are caused by cancer.
In China alone, 4.29 million people were detected as having cancer in 2015, and 2.8 million of them died in that year.




Collaboration to improve civil aviation between China and the European Union is advancing along with the growth of air travel, which reached some 8 million passenger trips last year, representing an annual increase of 15 percent, according to the chief of China's aviation authorities.
"China has signed bilateral transportation agreements with 27 out of the 28 EU countries, with 15 of the nations already having launched direct flights to China. Every week, there are more than 600 flights between China and the EU," according to Feng Zhenglin, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
Feng gave a keynote speech at the first joint aviation safety conference of the CAAC and European Aviation Safety Agency, held in Shanghai on Thursday.
Aviation cooperation between China and the EU has reached more than 100 programs dealing with such areas as laws and regulations, safety standards, airworthiness and maintenance, and aviation security, Feng said.
The two parties signed a letter of intent to work together in 2013, drew a road map for aviation security in 2015, and in 2016 launched the EU-China Aviation Partnership Project, according to Feng. A letter of intent supporting the project was signed on Wednesday at the conference's opening ceremony.
"A typical example of the deepened cooperation between China and EU is the Airbus final assembly line in Tianjin. There are about 1,400 Airbus aircraft being operated across China, accounting for nearly half of all aircraft in operation in China," he said.
Yu Nan, an industrial analyst from Haitong Securities, said: "There is huge growth potential in the Sino-EU aviation market compared with the fully developed Sino-US market. I expect more direct routes will be launched and more airlines to launch code-share agreements."
In the case of China and the United States, 812 flights between the two nations were made every week in the winter of 2016, up 20.8 percent from the summer of 2016, according to CAAC data.
There are as many as 15,000 passengers and 116 flights between the two every day.
Leading members of the aviation community at the conference discussed progress on establishing a bilateral aviation safety agreement between China and the European Union. More uniform standards, reached through a safety agreement, would make it easier for companies to market their aviation products in China and Europe, while maintaining the high safety record that benefits both regions.
"This year is the year of opportunities," said Henrik Hololei, director general for mobility and transport for the European Commission. Hololei said he expects a set of negotiations to be finalized soon between China and the EU that would include the safety agreement, which would benefit the aviation industry of both.
Panel discussions were held that dealt with such topics as implementing efficient safety management systems for maintenance, new technologies and developments in aircraft navigation systems, and efforts to promote the wider use of helicopters in China for uses like emergency medical services.
The conference marks a new high in aviation ties between China and the EU after steady grown in recent years, said Li Jian, deputy head of the CAAC.

Xiongan could emerge as the Chinese version of Tsukuba, the Japanese science city near Tokyo that was conceived in 1963 during the post-war reconstruction, experts say.
They said the planned Xiongan New Area could borrow ideas from Tsukuba. The latter has set an example on how to transform overcrowded, unmanageable metropolitan areas into parts of a larger and orderly economic region.
The April 1 announcement of the plan to create the Xiongan New Area laid emphasis on relocating Beijing's "non-capital" functions to Xiongan, about 100 kilometers south of the capital city.
The new area will be built into a green, livable and modern zone, which is expected to serve as a trailblazer in addressing the problems of big cities, a new engine for innovation and growth, and a bridge for infrastructure connecting Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province.
A similar scheme in Japan last century resulted in Tsukuba, which could be a role model for China's Xiongan New Area, said Zhou Muzhi, professor of economics at Tokyo Keizai University.
Tokyo grew into the world's largest city in 1955, thanks to Japan's rapid economic takeoff after World War II.
The Japanese government came up with the idea of relieving the densely populated capital through systematic relocation of 31 prominent national research and educational facilities to less-congested regions of Japan.
Tsukuba, a rural area 50 km northeast of Tokyo, was selected in 1963 as the site for Japan's first science city to host those institutes.
Japanese Prime Minister's Office set up the Academic New Town Construction Promotion Headquarters in 1964. The Tsukuba Academic New Town Construction Act came into force in 1970, setting the goal of "establishing a science city appropriate for conducting experimental research and education while at the same time developing a well-balanced rural city, and contributing to the ease of the excessive population concentration in the existing Tokyo metropolitan area".
The then planned science city, which now covers 284 square kilometers, was supposed to be home to 350,000 residents.
In the 1970s, people who moved to Tsukuba were said to need three things－high boots for the mud, a flashlight (as there were few streetlights) and a stick to keep stray dogs at bay.
In 1973, the University of Tsukuba was established, the forerunner of which was the Tokyo University of Education that was founded in 1949. And in 1980, all 31 national institutes selected to move from Tokyo were relocated to the new city.
Tsukuba has since grown tremendously, becoming home to 147 research institutes and 227,000 people, according to Zhou.
Today, Tsukuba is Japan's cutting-edge science city. Its research covers a wide range of areas, such as electronics, biotechnology, mechatronics, new materials, information engineering, space development, environmental science, natural resources, energy, earth sciences, civil engineering, construction and agriculture.
There are four Japanese Nobel laureates associated with Tsukuba. Shin-Itiro Tomonaga, professor emeritus of the Tokyo University of Education, received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1965; Leo Esaki, former president of the University of Tsukuba, was awarded the 1973 Nobel physics prize; Hideki Shirakawa, professor emeritus of the University of Tsukuba, was the winner of the chemistry prize in 2000; and Makoto Kobayashi, professor emeritus at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in the city, was the recipient of the 2008 physics prize.
"The Japanese government has had a very clear idea of what kind of city Tsukuba should be. That is, it should be an international science city," Zhou said. "Japan has made it (like that)."
A large community of international scholars and researchers also give the city a unique cosmopolitan quality. Tsukuba has achieved worldwide recognition as a major scientific and technology center.
The new city hosted the International Exposition on Science and Technology in 1985. The event's theme was apt: "Dwellings and Surroundings－Science and Technology for Man at Home".
The fair put Tsukuba on the global map. The science-driven city hosted the G7 Science and Technology Ministers' Meeting last year.
The city was also designated as the Tsukuba International Strategic Zone by the Japanese government. Through deregulation and tax incentives, the designation aims to promote "life innovation" for achieving a healthy aging society and "green innovation" for realizing a low-carbon society.
Tsukuba's success story shows that it is important to develop a clear vision for such a new city's role, have clarity on policies and be patient, Zhou said. "It took the Japanese government 20 years to move those institutes to Tsukuba."
He highlighted, however, that Tsukuba does not help relieve Tokyo's population density.
The Tokyo metropolitan area, which includes Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama and Tokyo prefectures, has seen its population increase from 11.28 million in 1950 to 38 million.
The rise of Tsukuba has not dwarfed Tokyo's towering position as a research center. The Japanese capital has 44.6 percent of the country's research professionals.
The Xiongan New Area, if developed well, would become a bright spot in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. But Beijing will continue to be the engine driving the growth of the region, Zhou said.
He said Beijing should sharpen its capability to manage its dense population, as people will continue to move in.
A major transportation network and basic infrastructure should be in place in Xiongan by 2020. The area will be well connected to Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei by 2022 when the Winter Olympic Games are held, according to Xinhua.

It said 24 of the injured were Russian nationals and 15 of them were taken to a Bangkok hospital for treatment. The other three injured were from Thailand.
Three Russians have undergone operations lasting several hours, Russian RIA news agency reported, citing a Russian diplomat in Bangkok. The diplomat cited doctors who say their lives were not in danger. Aeroflot also dismissed some media reports about spine injuries.
The Russian airline said in an earlier statement that several passengers had been injured during "severe turbulence" 40 minutes before landing in the Thai capital. It said the crew could not warn passengers of the danger because the turbulence occurred in a clear sky.
"All the injured were sent to a local hospital with injuries of a different kind of severity, mainly fractures and bruises," the embassy said. "The reasons behind the injures was that some of the passengers had not had their seatbelts fastened."
Airports of Thailand Pcl, Thailand's main airport operator, told Reuters the Boeing 777 had landed in Bangkok, but said any other comment should come from the airline.
Aeroflot operates two flights a day from Moscow to Bangkok. Thailand is a top destination for Russian tourists, with many visiting the country's beach resorts.

BEIJING -- China's Communist Party of China (CPC) is creating ways to gauge the political soundness of its more than 88 million members, a move experts believe could help the ruling party to maintain a clean political system.
The CPC's disciplinary branch released, for the first time earlier this month, nationwide breakdown figures of the "four forms" of discipline supervision and enforcement, first put forward by the branch in 2015 before making their way into regulations on intra-Party supervision in late October.
The four forms refer to four levels of punishment and supervision: criticism and self-criticism as well as inquiries through interview or letters should be the most common; minor disciplinary penalties should make up the majority; severely punished or demoted officials should be a small proportion; and those prosecuted for law-breaking should be extremely few.
In the first quarter of this year, disciplinary organs nationwide dealt with 179,000 people via the four forms, with 92,000, or 51.7 percent, falling in the first form after being tipped off about breaches of discipline, said the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI).
People subject to the other three forms accounted for 36.3 percent, 6.4 percent and 5.6 percent of the total respectively.
Such data was only made possible after the CCDI put a statistical indicator system into trial use, comprising of 56 indices, at the end of last year.
Xin Ming, a professor with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, said the regular release of the data and other statistics of rules violators could provide an accurate picture for the Party to identify risks, spot loopholes and facilitate solutions in Party governance.
Aiming for "green hills and clean water" in political discipline, the CPC has used analogy of managing trees in a forest, saying that the Party must "pluck rotten trees, cure sick trees and straighten crooked trees."
"Before the four forms concept was put forward, inspectors only fixed their eyes on a few sick or rotten trees instead of the entire forest," said Jiang Jinquan, a senior CCDI inspector. "Now they are turning their attention to trees in the entire forest."
Jiang described the transition from targeting "big tigers" to a comprehensive supervisory and discipline enforcement approach as "an important theoretical innovation."
As the battle against corruption has gained crushing momentum, the CPC said it would continue to reduce existing corruption and contain any rise in corruption in 2017, vowing to clear out sources of corruption and establish an effective prevention system.
"The first of the four forms is an important embodiment of the CPC's strict governance of the Party," said Xie Chuntao, a professor from the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
"It is expected to dispel the dated distinction between 'good comrades' and 'prisoners' by having a preventative effect, spotting and giving warning to CPC members engaging in petty misconduct at an early stage," he said.
Data show manufacturing sector keeps momentum, sub indexes remain strong
China's manufacturing growth slowed in April as the government tightened supervision of financial risks, but still maintains momentum, according to analysts.
The Purchasing Managers' Index, which reflects the manufacturing sector's performance, registered 51.2 in April, slightly lower than 51.8 a month earlier, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Sunday. The figure remains above the year-ago index of 50.1.
A figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector, which is a key driver of the Chinese economy, while anything below points to contraction. The reading has kept above 50 for nine consecutive months.
Although the growth speed slowed down a little compared with the previous two months, remaining above the 50 boom-or-bust point means that the sector has not lost its growth momentum and the economic fundamentals remain sound, according to Zhao Qinghe, a senior NBS statistician.
"Slower growth of domestic demand and supply and contracting energy-intensive industries have dragged down the pace of expansion of the manufacturing sector," Zhao said.
The PMI of high energy consumption was 49.3 in April, which is 2.1 points lower compared with the previous month and 1.9 points lower than the manufacturing sector as a whole.
His comment is echoed by data from the NBS released on Thursday in which growth of profits made by major large-scale industries slowed by 3.2 points in March compared with the previous two months.
Sluggish earnings growth in traditional sectors such as coal and steel is one of the major driving forces of sluggish profit growth, according to He Ping, also a statistician with the NBS.
"As Beijing puts more emphasis on fending off financial risks, manufacturing enterprises might face a tighter financing environment in the short term, putting pressure on production and on sales," said Xie Yaxuan, chief economist with China Merchants Securities. "But the policy environment will not put the sector or the economy into recession because some major drivers retain their growth potentials."
Some promising signs can be found in sub indexes of the PMI, in the equipment sector, which registered 52.1 and the high-tech manufacturing sector, reporting 53.4, in April, both well above the overall manufacturing sector.
Xie said high demand for consumption will support continued recovery of the economy. He cited the continued expansion of consumption manufacturing PMI reading in April, when it stood at 52.2.

According to a Realmeter survey released Monday, Moon Jae-in of the biggest Minjoo Party won 44.1 percent of support, far exceeding the 21.8 percent garnered by Ahn Cheol-soo of the minor centrist People's Party.
The result was based on a poll of 2,239 voters conducted from Friday to Saturday. It has 2.1 percentage points in a margin of error.
The gap between Moon and Ahn has recently widened on a controversy over Ahn's attitude in TV debates among the five major presidential candidates.
A presidential by-election is scheduled for May 9 after former President Park Geun-hye was impeached and arrested in March over corruption allegations.
Hong Joon-pyo of the former ruling Liberty Korea Party narrowed a difference with Ahn, winning 16.6 percent of approval rating. Support for Hong stemmed from conservative voters in their 60s or older, who are also the major support base for Ahn.
Sim Sang-jung of the minor progressive Justice Party ranked fourth with 8.6 percent of support, followed by Yoo Seong-min of the minor conservative Righteous Party who won 5.6 percent in approval scores.

Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen has called China's proposed Belt and Road Initiative "a future dynamo" for growth and prosperity in Asia and Europe.
Ahead of his four-day visit to China starting Tuesday, Rasmussen said he would use his trip to further boost his country's relationship with China, pledging to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative.
"The Belt and Road Initiative is indeed a very interesting foreign policy strategy," Rasmussen said. "Further connecting Europe and Asia firmly through trade and bilateral cooperation can hopefully be a future dynamo for growth and prosperity for both continents."
President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and China's top legislator Zhang Dejiang are scheduled to meet or hold talks with Rasmussen, and will exchange views on bilateral ties and issues of common concern.
Rasmussen's visit is among the recent high-level exchanges between China and the Nordic countries. Shortly after Xi's visit to Finland in early April, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg paid a visit to China to enhance bilateral relations.
Rasmussen visited China in 2010 during his previous term as Danish prime minister. His current term started since June 2015.
Rasmussen said he hoped the Belt and Road Initiative could provide economic stability and development for Central and South Asia –gateways between East Asia and Europe.
"This will be crucial for trade between the two biggest concentrations of economic power," he said.
The Danish prime minister also said his country – as one of the world's foremost shipping nations - has been engaged in linking the two continents for centuries.
This visit happens several days before the highly-anticipated Belt and Road Initiative Forum for International Cooperation on May 14 to 15 in Beijing. He said his country's representatives will be attending and "be happy to contribute" positively on both political and business level during the conference.
Rasmussen said China is Denmark's largest trading partner in Asia and his country was the first Nordic country to sign a comprehensive strategic partnership with China.
"We will now take our bilateral relationship to a new high," he said, "I am particularly pleased that we will launch our first 'Joint Work Program' during my visit."
Rasmussen revealed that the program contains 58 concrete joint cooperation areas toward 2020 between 80 Chinese and Danish state institutions, saying this will take the cooperation between the institutions of both sides one important step further.
During his visit, he said both sides will sign new agreements to strengthen economic and trade cooperation. For instance, he said a Chinese-Danish Food and Drug Regulatory Cooperation Center will be launched and it will help facilitate knowledge-sharing between public authorities in the two countries.
In terms of cultural and people-to-people exchanges, the prime minister said the two countries will sign a bilateral film agreement that allows China and Denmark to work on co-productions in the film area.
Rasmussen also said that Denmark and China have a close cooperation on international issues.
"We are both trading nations and strong supporters of free trade and increased global cooperation," said Rasmussen.
From the United Nations and climate change to the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Belt and Road Initiative, Rasmussen said there were many global issues with potential to deepend cooperation between both countries.
Rasmussen said he has met with President Xi on several occasions including the Nuclear Security Summit in 2016. "We've had very cordial and fruitful discussions during all our meetings – and it has led to many of the results that we now finalize in China during this visit," he said.
He also said that President Xi gave a very fine speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January and Denmark supports any efforts to stick to the road of trade liberalization and "better globalization". "Anything that China does will have an effect not only in Asia but on the rest of the world," said Rasmussen. "We wish to join China on this trip."

The proposal to set up the Xiongan New Area is attracting not only State-owned enterprises but the private sector, including startups, entrepreneurs and even fresh graduates from across China.
All are eager to set up a base, perhaps even headquarters, in the upcoming innovation hub.
"Xiongan will be a hot spot for startups and entrepreneurs. It's supposed to drive growth through innovation, technology upgrades and a brand new style of development," said Qu Chunwei, a native of Anxin county, Hebei province, who used to work in Tianjin.
His Xixiangyang village is part of Anxin county, one of the three counties that have been included in the new area, the grand plan for which was announced on April 1.
Qu has just returned to Xiongan to test waters for his own e-commerce business, an online payment app.
The app is expected to aggregate or integrate existing platforms such as WeChat Pay, Alipay, and UnionPay seamlessly. "That way, I can make transactions more convenient, because consumers don't have to download all the e-wallet service apps that different shops demand," he said.
"I think it'll have a huge market as more and more Xiongan residents will choose to pay bills with mobile phones in the future," Qu said.
He said the people of the three counties will become denizens of the Xiongan New Area; thus, all are his potential customers.
Two of Qu's childhood friends from Shanxi province have joined him in the venture. They are receiving training at a startup incubator in Anxin county.
Li Jinkui, deputy bureau chief of the Anxin Employment Service Bureau, said he has received many telephone enquiries from fresh graduates and migrant workers about the support they might receive if they relocate to the area to either set up business or work.
Li said free training would be provided to those starting up. The employment bureau will come out with more supportive policies to encourage people to start innovation-related businesses in future.
"We used to ask them (natives settled elsewhere) to return, but we were always rebuffed because they thought the small town didn't offer good opportunities," Li said.
Thanks to the Xiongan New Area plan, the situation has changed now.

The new area, the third national special economic zone after the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area, is of national significance and "crucial for the millennium to come", according to the central government.
"I believe the new area will bring a lot of opportunities that would be comparable to that of neighboring Beijing and Tianjin," said Yang Hejun, head of Anxin Mingdao Start-ups Service Co Ltd, a startup incubator.
The enterprise has enrolled about 20 candidates, including returnees and locals, for training in starting a new business.
Mingdao was established last year to help develop new businesses by giving them office space and related services, including advice on business and technology. It has set up 70 offices for use by startups.
Given the high chance for a rise in the number of innovative startups now, supportive policies could lead to the incubator's expansion, Yang said.
Not many Anxin natives working outside appear to have returned to their hometown like Qu had done in less than two weeks after the big announcement on April 1, he said. "But I've heard that many successful entrepreneurs in big cities like Beijing are planning to return."
Niu Gensheng, 64, a native of Rongcheng county, one of the three countries included in the Xiongan New Area, told Hebei Daily that he had advised his son, who works in Beijing, to return home in the near future.
According to Yang, most of the locals now based elsewhere are waiting for further clarity on policies and development plans for the new area. Such policies and plans are being drafted.
Yang said all those keen to set up startups, including himself, should be prudent, and choose only those business fields that are in accordance with the policies of the planned new area.
Xinhua News Agency quoted Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli as saying that Xiongan should promote innovation, attract high-tech enterprises and avoid becoming an industrial hub led by traditional industries.
The proposed emphasis appears to have inspired some of the established local entrepreneurs to adapt their development strategies accordingly.
Xu Linghua, chairman of Hebei Taidou Cable Group Co Ltd, said he has started combining his old business with innovation. Taidou Cable is a local private company engaged in the making of cables in Xiongxian, the third county included in the new area.
"My cable-making factories might adapt to the overall planning of the new area," Xu said, adding that he is keen to establish an online platform to exhibit and sell cable products across China.
"Even if my factories get eliminated (as part of the area development), internet-led businesses might be welcome, because cables will be still needed in the development of Xiongan," he said. "They will be needed in buildings and transportation facilities such as subway train systems," Xu said.

A Xinhua report quoted an official with the preparatory committee of Xiongan as saying that high-tech businesses such as 5G communications, biomedicine, artificial intelligence and internet finance might be welcome.
The master plan for the new area development has not yet been finalized.
Companies such as Hebei Hengshan Construction Co Ltd, which is based in the provincial capital Shijiazhuang, about 200 km away from Xiongan, are watching the situation closely.
Xing Shitian, who works with Hengshan, believes no matter how the area will develop, new infrastructure such as buildings is essential. Hengshan may well set up a branch in the area, he said.
"I hope specific policies for the development of Xiongan will be announced as soon as possible. We are well prepared to go there and seek new construction orders," Xing said.
While the private sector and individual entrepreneurs are awaiting policy clarity, State-owned enterprises have received initial support from policymakers.
The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council said on April 14 that central SOEs will be encouraged to locate their newly registered high-tech, new technology and high-end service businesses in the Xiongan New Area.
They "are encouraged to lend strong support to the construction of the zone in areas like energy security, infrastructure, electricity, telecommunications, rail transport, ecological protection, information-based networks and smart cities," it said in a statement.

Several victims are in critical condition as a result of the attack at 6 pm local time (0100GMT, May 1), according to police.
A witness said he heard the gunfire and saw the shooter "sitting, drinking a beer in one hand with a gun out in the other" in the pool area of an apartment complex in San Diego, California.
The shooter, described as a white male armed with a gun, was fatally shot by three police officers who had arrived at the scene, said San Diego police chief Shelley Zimmerman.
Champ aims to become first double winner of China Open

Li Haotong will have history on his mind when the Volvo China Open tees off at Beijing's Topwin Golf and Country Club on Thursday.
China's defending champion is aiming to become the first two-time winner of the 23-year-old event when he returns to the scene of his greatest triumph, where last year he won his first European Tour title.
Although Li has yet to add to that success, he has enjoyed a positive start to the 2017 season, tying for fifth place alongside former Masters champion Danny Willett at the recent Maybank Challenge in Malaysia.
But the 21-year-old Li faces a stiff challenge to retain his crown from a tough 156-man field that includes seven other former winners－including 2015 champ and compatriot Wu Ashun－and 13 of the world's top 100 players.
"As a young golf pro I was so glad to win the Volvo China Open," Li said. "The victory meant a lot because it was a huge personal breakthrough for me.
"This year is Volvo's 90th anniversary and the 30th anniversary of Volvo's association with golf, so I'm honored to be a part of this history.
"Volvo's junior match-play event, the qualifiers and of course the Volvo China Open have all been part of my development as a professional.
"I have to thank Volvo for their 23 years of support of golf in China, and I look forward to their continued support. I hope more young golfers will play in Volvo's junior events and be inspired to play in the Volvo China Open."
Among the notable European names going for the 3.33 million yuan ($484,000) first prize will be England's Ross Fisher, currently fifth in the European Tour's Race to Dubai money standings.
In building on his third-place finish in last week's Shenzhen International, Fisher expects stiff competition from Sweden's Robert Karlsson, who topped the European money list in 2008, and Austria's Bernd Wiesberger, who won in Shenzhen and sits sixth in the Race to Dubai standings.
Also entertaining the crowds on the spectacular Ian Woosnam-designed course, situated in the hills of Huairou alongside the Great Wall, will be Danish duo Thomas Bjorn, Europe's 2018 Ryder Cup captain, and Thorbjorn Olesen, a four-time winner on the European Tour.
The 20 million yuan ($3 million) tournament has had four Chinese winners in the past.
"The Volvo China Open has enjoyed some wonderful performances over the years and having back-to-back Chinese winners in Wu Ashun (2015) and Li Haotong (2016) was a real milestone for the tournament," said Sven De Smet, chairman of the Volvo China Open board and vice-president of brand and marketing for Volvo Car Asia Pacific.
"As the longest running sponsor of men's professional golf, we at Volvo are delighted to have played a role in the growth of the sport, not only in Europe but also in Asia Pacific.
"This week, the Volvo China Open will become the 136th tournament－and the 86th on The European Tour－to be sponsored by Volvo and we look forward to welcoming 156 players from 26 countries for what is truly a world-class international event."


MANILA/SEOUL - Southeast Asian leaders urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to seriously comply with its international obligations during their summit, voicing concerns over Pyongyang's test-firing of mid-range ballistic missiles.

The 10 leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held their 30th annual summit and retreat in Manila on Saturday.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose country holds the rotating chair of ASEAN this year, officially released the chairman's statement on Sunday.

"We discussed the situation on the Korean Peninsula and are gravely concerned about recent developments, including (DPRK's) two nuclear tests in 2016 and subsequent launches using ballistic missile technology like the submarine-launched ballistic missile," the ASEAN leaders said in a chairman's statement issued at the end of their summit.

"We urged (the DPRK) to immediately cease all actions that violate its international obligations and contravene UN Security Council resolutions," the leaders said.

The leaders reaffirmed the importance of compliance with international law and the full implementation of all relevant UN security Council resolutions.

The leaders also reiterated their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and "for the concerned parties to exercise restraint in order to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula".

"We strongly urged (the DPRK) to comply with these resolutions and acknowledged the importance to exercise self-restraint and called on all parties to exert collective efforts in the interest of maintaining peace, security and stability in the region and the world," the leaders said.

The Republic of Korea's Foreign Ministry denounced the launch as an "obvious" violation of United Nations resolutions and the latest display of the DPRK's "belligerence and recklessness."

"We sternly warn that the (DPRK) government will continue to face a variety of strong punitive measures issued by the UN Security Council and others if it continues to reject denuclearization and play with fire in front of the world," the ministry said.

The ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile flew for several minutes and reached a maximum height of 71 kilometers before it apparently failed.

It didn't immediately provide an estimate on how far the missile flew, but a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said it was likely a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile. It broke up a few minutes after the launch.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, speaking after a meeting of Japan's National Security Council, said the missile is believed to have traveled about 50 kilometers and fallen on an inland part of the DPRK.

LONDON－Unbeaten Deontay Wilder will have a ringside view of rival heavyweight champions Anthony Joshua and Wladimir Klitschko in their unification showdown at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, with hopes to fight the winner by December.
The 31-year-old American, who owns the World Boxing Council crown, will serve as a television analyst when Britain's unbeaten Joshua (18-0, 18 KO) defends his International Boxing Federation crown and vies for the vacant World Boxing Association title against Ukraine's Klitschko (64-4, 53 KO), before a sellout crowd of more than 90,000.
"I'm excited to see it," said Wilder, who owns a record of 38-0, with 37 knockouts.
"I'm looking forward to getting my own bird's-eye view of both fighters for a future fight. I'm definitely going there to scout. I'm looking for a fighting partner."
When it comes to picking a winner, Wilder is torn, saying, "My heart goes to Joshua but my mind says Klitschko will win."
Wilder has owned the WBC crown for two years and wants a July fight with New Zealand's unbeaten Joseph Parker, the World Boxing Organization champion, with the winner to meet the Joshua-Klitschko victor.
"Whoever unifies is going to bring another era to the heavyweight division－one name, one champion, once and for all. Undisputed. It's going to be better for boxing. You'll see a different atmosphere," Wilder said.
"I'm confident I'm the best in the division. I will unify the division. I'm just being patient and waiting for my time to come."
Parker, 22-0 with 18 knockouts, had a May fight against Britain's Hughie Fury called off on Saturday.
"I want Parker in July," Wilder said. "Why not? He don't have any opponent now. Let's unify. Let's make it happen. It makes so much sense.
"What would be better than me fighting Parker and then at the end of the year fighting for one undisputed title? I'm looking forward to unifying this division and bringing it back to America."
Wilder took some verbal swipes at Joshua and Klitschko, citing the Englishman's past foes as lackluster and the ex-champion as possibly too far past his prime.
"There's a lot of flaws in Joshua," Wilder said. "He's still young in the game. He's going off the physique and the height. But if you soul-search deep down and look at his resume, you'll get your answer.
"He has the power. At any given time he can get you out of there. He's definitely going to have to move and take angles with Klitschko, but I think he has a chance."
Klitschko, who has sparred more than 50 rounds with Wilder over the years, is 41 and lost his title to Tyson Fury in his most recent fight 17 months ago.
"I hope Klitschko brings Klitschko. I think he's ready. He's going to show a lot of things," said Wilder.
"He's going to teach Joshua a lot of things during this fight. Sometimes you have to let them know 'I'm still a monster'."
Wilder said he plans to visit Kenya next month and Jordan next year to investigate possible fights in those countries and vowed: "If it's safe, I'll go anywhere in the world."
After failed doping tests scuttled two prior title fights, Wilder insists on Nevada-style drug tests for any foe.
"You better be clean by the time you fight me 'cause we're going to find out about it real quick," he said.
"And even if you're doped, I'll still whoop you."

Deepening of positive change is part of blueprint drawn up by Xi to help the people and the nation realize aspirations
Liu, 24, a resident of Chengguan district in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, said that in the past, he had to work at least two years in Lanzhou before applying for the city's hukou, but now he could submit the application at any time as long as he owned a house in the city.
Measures have been rolled out across the country to facilitate hukou application procedures since the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform, headed by President Xi Jinping, reviewed and passed a guideline at a meeting in early 2014.
Comprehensively deepening reform is one of the "Four Comprehensives", a strategic blueprint drawn up by Xi that creates pathways to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.
Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has presided over 34 meetings of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform since its establishment in late 2013.
Poverty alleviation, healthcare, employment and education were among the key issues discussed at the meetings, which aimed to improve people's lives.
During a meeting of the central leading group held early this year, Xi said leading CPC and government officials are central to the national reform drive. They must act to "shoulder the heaviest burden, and chew on the hardest bones", he said.
Xi has taken the lead. In the four years since he became general secretary, reform has emerged as a hallmark of his administration. Xi's first trip outside Beijing as the leader of the CPC, in 2012, was to Guangdong province, which has been at the forefront of China's decadeslong reform and opening-up drive.
"Reforms are always in the present tense, not the past tense," Xi has said.
Last year, he visited Xiaogang village, often called the birthplace of rural reform, in Anhui province, where he called for a solid agricultural sector and improved conditions for farmers.
In July, during an event to mark the 95th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, Xi said reform and opening-up will be crucial to deciding the fate of modern China.
The general objectives of reform are improving socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernizing the State governance system, according to a communique issued after the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in 2013. The session featured a comprehensive reform package covering 60 tasks and over 300 reform measures.
Reform must be focused on issues of public concern, Xi has said. It must serve to resolve outstanding problems in ordinary people's lives and meet their demands and needs. It should be carried out by the people and for the people.
Among the reform tasks, poverty reduction is a key step in improving people's lives. Xi said in his most recent New Year's address that what he cares most about is poor people.
The whole process of poverty reduction requires tailored poverty relief policies and precise measures, and sometimes patience and accuracy like "doing embroidery", Xi told lawmakers during the top legislature's annual session in March.
According to a standard set in 2011, China categorizes those with an annual income lower than 2,300 yuan ($334) as poverty-stricken. The CPC has made a solemn promise to lift all those still living in poverty out of that status by the end of 2020.
The number of people living in poverty nationwide was reduced by 12.4 million last year to 43.35 million. The government will lift another 10 million people out of poverty this year, according to the Government Work Report.
Other endeavors to help improve the people's livelihoods are also taking shape.
The National Development and Reform Commission said in April that all public hospitals will end the longtime practice of drug price markups by September as part of ongoing healthcare reform. That is expected to help resolve problems like overprescribing, overuse of antibiotics and unnecessary increases in medical expenses. Hospitals' loss of revenue will be offset, for the most part, by a rise in prices for patient services, and more government investment is likely.
In the economic sphere, Xi has promised extensive supply-side structural reform.
The reform, proposed at the end of 2015 to resolve structural imbalances in the economy, has been focused on five tasks: cutting industrial capacity, reducing housing inventory, lowering indebtedness, cutting corporate costs and improving weak economic links. Efforts in these areas paid off last year. China met the annual target to reduce overcapacity of 45 million metric tons of steel and 250 million metric tons of coal production ahead of schedule, and a large number of zombie enterprises were shut down.
To advance supply-side reform, China has to handle the relationships between government and market, short term and long term, addition and subtraction, and supply and demand, Xi said in January, during a group study held by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
The country's clean-governance and supervisory system is another area of political reform that has far-reaching importance. In January 2016, Xi stressed that the country must upgrade the structure of its supervisory organizations and establish a national supervisory system that will oversee all State organs and civil servants.
Han Qingxiang, a professor of public administration at the Party School of the Central Committee of the CPC, said that reform has continued to be a key theme of China's development since the country embarked on its reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s.
The reform drive is now in a deep-water zone because many of the easier reforms have been accomplished, leaving the difficult tasks, he said.
Zhu Lijia, a professor with the Chinese Academy of Governance, said the country had made remarkable progress, and the experience of the past few years will be invaluable over the next three to five years.
"Deepening overall reform needs both determination and wisdom because the country's reform is facing arduous and complicated tasks," he said, adding that reform should address such problems as a widening income gap, corruption and employment issues.

BEIJING -- Source control is crucial to eliminating the use of "gutter oil" in China, an expert has said.
Zhu Yi, associate professor at China Agricultural University, was referring to recycled oil made from kitchen waste dredged from gutters behind restaurants and inedible animal oil, as the General Office of the State Council released a guideline to monitor and control the use of such oil Monday.
He said that only by comprehensive supervision and management could enforcers cut off the source of gutter oil, and that the effect of merely punishing violators was limited.
Zhu said that awarding and protecting whistleblowers who report the production, sale and use of the oil would help improve the management of smaller restaurants and oil producers, which he believes are more difficult to supervise.
According to the guideline, more methods will be mobilized to prevent use of the oil, including awards for whistleblowers.
Moreover, catering businesses will be encouraged to install cameras in kitchens, processing workshops and disposal workshops so that kitchen garbage can be traced.
A couple of restaurants in Shanghai have already been answering the call, setting up live streaming in kitchens for customers to watch, showing the restaurants' food safety.
URUMQI -- The world's closest glacier to a city shrank quickly in the past year and may completely vanish in half a century, according to a Chinese scientist Saturday.
In the last 12 months, the east and west stretches of Glacier No. 1 in the Tianshan Mountains in northwest China, shrank by about 7.2 and 6.3 meters, respectively, according to a recent survey by researchers with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
Glacier No.1 is approximately 130 km from Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
"There has been a remarkable increase of polluting dust on Glacier No.1 in recent years," said Li Zhongqin, head of CAS Tianshan Mountains Glacier Observation Station.
He said that the dust could come from mining, vehicles on a nearby national highway nearby or soil degradation due to overgrazing.
"Given climate change, if no measures are taken, the shrinking will accelerate and the glacier may disappear in 50 years," he said. "If protection is strengthened, it could last for 70 to 90 years."
SAN DIEGO - A man holding a gun in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other opened fire on people around a swimming pool in a San Diego apartment complex, killing one and injuring others before police shot him dead on Sunday, media said.
The gunman launched his attack during a birthday celebration in the complex in the city's University City section, NBC News' San Diego affiliate reported.
One resident, who identified himself as John, told KFMB-TV he saw the gunman "sitting, drinking a beer in one hand with a gun out in the other" in the pool area.
He said he and his wife saw "three people laying on the ground shot" and one wounded victim trying to crawl to another to give assistance.
Two police officers arrived and confronted the gunman, who exchanged gunfire with the officers before he was shot, the witness said. Some of the victims were taken away in cars to hospital before paramedics made it to the scene.
The gunman was killed after pointing his weapon at police, San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman told reporters. She did not identify the suspect or mention a possible motive.
Eight people were injured when the shooting broke out just after 6 p.m. local time (0100 GMT Monday), Zimmerman said, several of them left in a critical condition.
Media including NBC's affiliate and CNN, citing Zimmerman, reported late Sunday night that a female victim had died. Media reports said the gunman was a resident of the complex.

TIANJIN -- Running confidently on the home stretch with a smile on his face, the 30-year-old Yun Yanqiao, a grassroots ultra-marathon runner, clinched the first ever mass marathon gold medal in the 58-year-history of China's National Games here on Saturday.
A total of 4,128 amateur runners competed in the marathon events at the 13th Chinese National Games, a quadrennial multi-sport competition which only featured professional athletes in the past.
The race was staged under sunny conditions with the temperature soaring up to 32 degrees. Yun from Shandong Province, who used to be a power engineer before throwing himself into ultra running, clocked 2:32:45 to finish on top of the amateur group, winning with a margin of 39 seconds ahead of runner-up Mou Zhenhua.
You Peiquan from Fujian Province finished third in 2:33:45
"This gold medal really means a lot to me," said an excited Yun, a two-time winner at the Vibram Hong Kong 100km Ultra Trail Race.
"When I first know amateur runner can compete in the National Games, I was just so excited as my running peers did. Today nearly all the best grassroots runners in China are competing here, which will definitely be an encouragement for the other runners to keep running and improve their personal bests," he added.
Tang Hui, a primary school physical education teacher, registered a comfortable victory in the women's mass race, edging out second-placed Fang Guangxia by nearly seven minutes with a clocking of 2:55:51.
Shi Yanxiu, also an ultra runner, clocked 3:06:43 to take the bronze medal.
The mass participation in marathon is a part of the innovation and reforms introduced to the 13th edition of the National Games by the organizers, in a bid to demonstrate comprehensive values at the country's highest-level sporting event.
"Grassroots athletes" are allowed to compete alongside professional athletes at the Games in 19 sports such as swimming, badminton and table tennis.
"Inviting mass runners to compete at the National Games is just the first step," said Du Zhaocai, vice president and secretary-general of the Chinese Athletics Association (CAA). "Next we will go on to provide them with opportunities to vie for a berth at the national team to compete at the World Championships and Olympic Games."
The CAA has already launched a program that aims to select two grassroots runners, one man and one woman, to represent China to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.
Wang Jiali, winner of 2010 Beijing Marathon with a PB of 2:22:41, clocked 2:33:36 to win the women's race for professional runners, while Dong Guojian, a two-time Olympian, won the men's race in 2:18:45. But both were upstaged by the history-making feats from Yun and Tang.

"I agree (to the idea). They can have joint exercise(s) here in Mindanao, maybe in the Sulu Sea," Duterte told reporters after visiting the Chinese warship docked in Davao City wharf.
Duterte said he was very impressed by the Chinese warship. "It's very impressive. It's all carpeted. It's so beautiful. Inside, it's like a luxury hotel," he told reporters, "It's clean!"
He said the visit to the warship is part of the confidence building and good will between Manila and Beijing.
A Chinese naval fleet has begun a three-day friendly visit after arriving Sunday at Davao City in the southeastern region of The Philippines.

China General Nuclear Power Corp said it is confident the first phase of the UK government's assessment of the company's plan to build a nuclear power plant in southeastern England will be completed by mid-November.
"We plan to submit the preliminary security report to the British government by mid-November and wrap up all the first phase examination work by then," said Mao Qing, the project manager at CGN responsible for Hualong One's assessment, at the 12th China International Exhibition on Nuclear Power Industry 2017 in Beijing on Thursday.
"We are confident that Hualong One is not only safe and technically mature, but also economically competitive, and will pass the UK's strict approval process."
The UK government asked nuclear regulators to begin the Generic Design Assessment of CGN's Hualong One reactor design, China's domestically developed third-generation reactor, in January, a process that industry experts expect to take about 60 months in four phases.
An expert said he believes there are high chances Hualong One meets the British government's stringent safety, security and design requirements and receiving approval from UK will also make it easier to export Hualong One to other developed nations.
Considering CGN's vast experience in building nuclear facilities at home and the significance of the nuclear power plant at Bradwell in southeastern England, chances are high that the parameters are met, said Joseph Jacobelli, a senior analyst with Asia utilities and infrastructure research at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Representatives from the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation and Environment Agency spoke highly of CGN's design research and operation capacity after a visit to the company's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in March, according to Mao.
UK Energy Minister Jesse Norman also said earlier the stringent regulatory regime in the UK's nuclear industry is to ensure security and the mitigation of any potential environmental accidents.
According to Mao, after the first phase of preparation which is expected to take 10 months, the company will spend another 12 months on the evaluation of a preliminary safety report, followed by a 13-month security and environmental impact assessment evaluation before construction and a 25-month discussion with British nuclear safety regulators for further technological improvements.
CGN has well prepared itself for all kinds of potential risks and response strategies in accordance with the British government's assessment requirements, said Mao.
CGN and French utility Electricite de France SA has set up an industrial partnership, General Nuclear Services, to promote the assessment.
CGN Chairman He Yu said earlier that investing in Bradwell will push forward Chinese reactors' global market development.
A statue depicting an adult male urinating was on display in Shanghai.Photo Provided To China Daily
A statue some visitors found indecent at a fashion-themed area in Yangpu district was wrapped up on Wednesday, ready to be dismantled.
The controversial figure, placed outside a chocolate factory at Shanghai Fashion Center, depicts a standing man urinating.
The statue, designed by an Austrian artist, has created much controversy as some parents said it is inappropriate for children.
"Everyone knows" that people should not urinate indiscriminately, one netizen wrote on social media, "but what message is this sculpture trying to deliver to people, especially children?"
Others said the controversy was a reflection of some people's outdated and conservative thinking.
"European artists including Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn and Francois Boucher have created famous artworks depicting adults answering nature's call," another netizen wrote. "China should adopt an open mind to these artworks. Art should not be limited to museums."
The man who imported the artwork from Austria years ago said little thought or study had been expended over the meaning of the sculpture.
"The sculpture was equipped with an induction gadget and the figure would start to urinate when visitors passed by," said Fang Yimin, head of Zotter Chocolate Theater.
He said the managers of Shanghai Fashion Center thought the sculpture was interesting when they paid a visit to Austria, so they asked that it be shipped to Shanghai. It paid 60,000 yuan ($8,700) in customs duties.
A publicity official at Yangpu District Planning and Land Authority said on Wednesday that the sculpture will be removed.
"We contacted Zotter Chocolate Theater and asked them to cover the sculpture," he said. The authority will take some time to study whether the piece is genuine artistic sculpture or just landscape artwork.
If it is an art sculpture, it will be removed because the merchant did not complete the required procedure to install it; and if it is just vulgar artwork, it will be removed because it is not appropriate to be shown in a public space, he said.
There are roughly 3,500 statues in public spaces across Shanghai, with the city keen to appeal to its international population.
In November, a sculpture copied from British artist Wendy Taylor's work Timepiece - which is displayed in London - was removed from Pudong New Area's Dongchang Riverfront Garden.

China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, the C919, is expected to take to the sky for its maiden flight on Friday, as the country endeavors to meet soaring domestic travel demand and break the global market duopoly of Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE.
The debut flight is set to take place at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, subject to weather conditions, the C919's Shanghai-based manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, said on Wednesday.
Soon after it was established in 2008, COMAC began the research to develop the twin-engine C919, which would be used for medium-haul flights with 158 to 174 seats. It is expected to compete with the updated Airbus A320 and the new-generation Boeing B737.
China has its own military and regional aircraft manufacturers, and the development of the airplane serves as a key index to assess the country's industrial and technical manufacturing capacity.
"The first flight of the C919 signals that China will be able to make a significant breakthrough for the country's civil aircraft manufacturing industry, and it could have the opportunity to break the monopolies of Boeing and Airbus," said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, a large Chinese civil aviation website.
Despite the promising future, Lin said the C919's entry to the market won't occur soon. The date it goes into operation is expected to be between 2020 and 2022.
So far, COMAC has received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as the State-owned Air China, China Southern and China Eastern; and private airlines Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines. China Eastern will be the first to take delivery.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany and Thailand and others from the Asia Pacific region and Africa.
Boeing earlier predicts that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total delivery for China from global aircraft manufacturers.
"While the program has faced its share of challenges－like any development program of this size－the results speak for themselves," said Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific, one of the C919's suppliers.
"The C919 is a sleek, modern and efficient airplane. It is ready to compete on a global scale, heralding China's ambitious plans to grow and develop its domestic air transportation industry with the help of international partners."
COMAC said last week it has started the research to develop a widebody commercial jet with Russia for delivery within 10 years.








 
The C919 is a single-aisle commercial aircraft built for medium-haul flights, with up to 174 seats and twin engines. Its maiden flight will take off from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport.
The test center said the five pilots - Cai Jun (captain), Wu Xin (copilot), Qian Jin (observer), as well as Ma Fei and Zhang Dawei (engineers) - have long flight experience, the newspaper Jiefang Daily reported.
During the preparatory stage, Cai, Wu and Qian were involved in the evaluation of the cockpit. They also carried out two mock flights ahead of the first test flight, and completed slow- and medium-speed gliding tests.
Before joining the test center six years ago, Cai was a pilot at the China Eastern Airlines. So far, he has flown 10,300 hours. Cai said that as a test pilot, flight is only part of his work, he also takes part in finalizing flight plans, verifying flight data and other work.
Besides the five test pilots, the center said it has also prepared a backup team, and will decide the final team on May 5.

With a welding torch in hand, Huang Chunyan finds her destiny
Lu'an, Anhui – If Huang Chunyan had to choose between cooking and welding as a pastime, she says it would be an easy choice. She would pick the latter.
It was nearly 30 years ago that Huang, now 46, a senior welder with Brainware Chang'an Electronics Co Ltd, picked up her first welding torch. However, it was not an easy introduction.
"Welding was such hard and dirty work," she recalls.
During a time when graduates were given assigned jobs, Huang was offered the job after graduating from a vocational technical school at the age of 19.
"I told myself that if she could do it, so could I."
A model worker
As a newbie in the field, Huang often got burns all over her arms as she practiced her welding skills.
"When I got burned, I thought this perhaps was not a job meant for women." But Huang was not born to be a quitter; she stuck to it. "I clenched my teeth, carried on and gradually got used to the pain."
Huang thinks that welders, be men or women, need a physical strength as strong as their state of mind.
"Squatting for long hours, standing and holding the torch steadily are mentally and physically challenging tasks every welder goes through," she says.

After World War II, the People's Liberation Army took over the administration of Harbin from the departing Soviet forces in 1946, three years before the founding of New China.
The first public security bureau under the Communists was then established in the city. Chen, a former commander in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army led by the Communist Party, was appointed as the chief.
Speaking about the production, Chen Zhimin, the vice-minister of China's Ministry of Public Security, which is one of the producers, says the series sheds light on a lesser known aspect of the country's history.

Peter Quiatkowski is proud to have made his mark on China's deep-sea oil exploration industry in the past decade.
"When I arrived, the oil business in China was picking up very fast. We were lucky enough to be on the move and were carried along with this," says Quiatkowski, 67, an oil expert from Britain.
Since 2007, Quiatkowski has played a pioneer role in the industry as general manager of Cosl-Expro Testing Services (Tianjin) Company, a joint venture established by China Oilfield Services Limited and the oilfield services provider Expro Group of Britain.
Quiatkowski, who has been in the industry for more than 40 years and has worked in many places, including Africa and South America, says he did not know what to expect before he arrived in China.
He soon found the new environment encouraging. The country was busy preparing for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, and there was "a general enthusiasm for change in the country", he says.
Although Chinese companies were entering new fields and needed overseas help, he was happy to see his Chinese team was well educated and was keen to learn.
"So we had the right ingredient," he says. "They just needed some leadership to get everybody to pull in the right direction."
Early on Quiatkowski put a great deal of emphasis on policies and procedures. It took some time for his Chinese colleagues to understand his approach and get used to new ways of doing things.
"It was a practical challenge to let everybody understand we had to behave in an international way if we wanted to enter the international market," he says.
Drawing on his international experience, Quiatkowski made training a key part of his long-term strategy.
The joint venture frequently sends groups of employees, 99 percent of whom are Chinese, to Britain for training.
"No matter how good the captain is, the ship still would not sail without a good crew," he says.
The company has put in bids against the strongest international competitors and won the contract for a deep-water well testing project of a major Canadian energy company in 2008, marking the first successful step for Chinese oilfield services companies to go international.
Since then the company has provided oil testing services to more than 10 leading international oil companies.
Quiatkowski's team provided the advanced technology and highly trained Chinese crew that carried out well testing services on the sixth-generation semi-submersible oil rig CNOOC HY 981, which went into service in 2012.
It was the first independent deep-water oil drilling operation by a Chinese company, making China one of the few countries that can explore for deep-water oil and gas.
The team also introduced innovative methods to significantly reduce the time required for similar tasks.
This exemplified the Chinese team coming a long way toward becoming top-level players in the field, he says.
"They are stretching the boundaries."
Quiatkowski's work has been recognized by the Chinese authorities. In 2014 he received the Friendship Award, the highest honor given by the Chinese government to foreigners who have made significant contributions to the country's social and economic development.
"It means so much to me. I feel like I should give back more."

Vaughn Barber believes good business is built on trust. And, to that end, he wants to serve as a bridge between Chinese and foreign companies.
"It is something I can do to contribute uniquely," says Barber, 46, global chair of KPMG global China practice.
Over the years, his firm has helped Chinese State-owned and private companies conduct overseas mergers and acquisitions in sectors such as energy and power, mining, financial services, manufacturing and infrastructure.
When he was at school in Brisbane, Barber's father had suggested that he connects with China in the future. Learning Chinese would give him an advantage, he says his father told him then.
"That decision I made with his advice when I was so young has actually changed the course of everything," Barber says.
Barber's learning of Chinese allowed him to come to China on a scholarship for a year's study in 1987. The program, started by the Australian government, included language training in the first half of the year and attending classes with local Chinese students later. Barber also got chances to visit different cities here.
"After being in China, I understand better that money makes the world go around, and having a good understanding about business is important," he says.
Barber became a chartered accountant after college and worked in Australia for three years. He joined KPMG Hong Kong in 1996 as an assistant manager and became a partner in 2000. He moved to Beijing in 2011 and continues to work with Chinese outbound investors.
During his years in Hong Kong, Barber had many opportunities to visit the mainland. So he was asked to work out of Beijing to help foreign companies aiming to enter the Chinese market at the time. However, Barber noticed that more Chinese companies were looking to acquire important assets overseas by then.
"I said: 'No, my role is to advise Chinese companies going into the world,'" he recalls, explaining that he had realized it was an area KPMG needed to focus on.
From 2007, Barber, who combined his accounting skills with communication in Chinese, began leading a team in Hong Kong that provided tax advise to Chinese companies going abroad.
After moving to Beijing, he became head of the China outbound investment business for KPMG and chair of its "global China practice" in 2016.
His team has been following China's economic policies closely, such as the development goals stated in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20).
When the Chinese companies were seeking overseas investment opportunities earlier, his company published reports to help Australia understand Chinese investors better, as well as help Chinese companies understand the global markets better.
When KPMG started its "global China practice" in 2013, it was more about supporting Chinese foreign investors, he says.
"But also we think that we need to help foreign companies understand the opportunities and the changing environment (as projected) in the 13th Five-year Plan and beyond, and how they can engage in the Belt and Road Initiative."
In the past years, Barber and his team have made efforts to help their in-house colleagues around the world understand China better. For example, they carried out an internal online education campaign called China Confident Program, to give teams information about Chinese culture, history, business practices and the economy. The program was designed by some bilingual members in the company like Barber who have lived in China for a while.
"When they (Chinese companies) go into new markets, they need to work with our local teams because they need the best advice. So we worked together with the local team," he explains.
Barber says requests for the program have been made by KPMG teams especially in countries that are seeking to engage with China-related businesses effectively.
But he says that China's profile tends to differ from other countries and misunderstandings about China still exist in a few places.
"China has a role to play, too. More communication coming this way will improve the situation," he says, adding good company behavior and people-to-people interactions are important.
Barber is frequently seen at seminars organized by the Chinese government, speaking on how Chinese investors can do more worldwide and on China's economic development.
While trying to provide advice based on his own expertise, Barber believes participating in such forums also helps him better understand the country's development.
"You can't wear the glasses coming from outside China and apply that to China. You need to understand the context, which requires an investment of time and also requires you to live here," he adds.
Barber, who lives with his wife, a Chinese he met in Hong Kong, and their daughter, says he is accustomed to life in Beijing and spends most of his spare time with family and friends.
"I enjoy my life here. It's a cosmopolitan place," he says.
Since his first trip here in the 1980s, Barber has witnessed China change really quickly.
The quality of life is much better today and China is more open and confident, he says.
"It's also why it's important to engage foreign companies. There are opportunities, and by participating constructively, you contribute to the process of opening-up reform and the livelihood of normal people."

The 2017 Beijing International School Expo will be held at the Crowne Plaza Beijing Chaoyang U-Town on Saturday and Sunday (Feb 18-19).
More than 60 international schools have confirmed they'll participate, including the British Schools of Beijing, Keystone Academy and the Canadian International School of Beijing.
The annual event is the capital's largest gathering of international schools to help families with international education options in Beijing.
The Starter's Scholarships (1,000-5,000 yuan/$145-$727) will be awarded on the basis of a drawing competition (for younger children) and an essay-writing competition (for older students).
There also will be children's areas on-site to keep the little ones entertained and busy.
Meir Oren inspects ward at the First Hospital affiliated to Shihezi University in Xinjiang.  [Photo provided to China Daily]
An expert on medical emergency is now helping a hospital in Northwest China. In the 1990s, he used to work as a senior official in Israel's Health Ministry.
His expertise includes hospital preparedness for exceptional scenarios such as bacterial warfare, bioterrorism or natural disasters. The military trained him for such emergencies in his youth.
"It's a common challenge that any hospital manager faces," Meir Oren, 68, says.
Oren started his China chapter in 2010, when a colleague who had worked here earlier introduced him to some hospitals. Then, the Hillel-Yaffe Medical Center, a major hospital in Hadera, Israel, with which he has been long associated, organized staff visits to hospitals in Sichuan province, the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Shanxi province and Beijing.
After the tour, Oren, a former CEO of Hillel-Yaffe, saw an opportunity to help the First Hospital affiliated to Shihezi University in Xinjiang, because of the Israeli hospital's experience in trauma treatment. So far, three joint seminars on emergency preparedness, attended by medical professionals and senior healthcare officials have been held in Israel.
Such interactions have given doctors and the Shihezi hospital management a chance to observe Hillel-Yaffes' operations over weeks.
"When they return to China, they are able to implement many concepts and practices that they find suitable here," Oren says.
At the Shihezi hospital, international conferences related to emergency preparedness are held every two years, with assistance from Oren's center where he was CEO until last year.
The tie-up seems to be working.
In 2011, Zhang Hongwei, a general surgeon of the Shihezi hospital was able to establish a new emergency department there following his return from a training program at Hillel-Yaffe.
The Chinese doctors "quickly understood how important it is to cope successfully with terror events and other emergencies", Oren says.
In the past few years, his organization has trained more than 100 medical professionals from different partner hospitals in China, both in clinical fields and emergency situations, in Israel.
Training programs have also been carried out in China. And they have helped many hospitals in China, according to his colleague Moris Topaz, who initially asked Oren to come to China.
Oren himself has recommended many Israeli experts to China for academic exchanges, training and conferences over the years.
His relationship with the country is more than professional.
Terrence Curtin, CEO of TE Connectivity.
We understand the Belt and Road Initiative's significance in promoting economic growth and regional cooperation, and we appreciate the tremendous efforts China has put into this gigantic project.
We regard the many infrastructure projects proposed under the framework of this initiative as enhancing connectivity across Asia, Europe and Africa. This presents a large opportunity for TE, as we are well positioned to offer our unparalleled connectivity and sensing technologies and products in the energy infrastructure, ICT (information and communication technologies) infrastructure, railway links and many other sectors.
We are also encouraged by the China's welcome attitude to foreign participation into this project. As the Belt and Road forum will gather many world leaders to discuss the road map forward in Beijing, I believe companies like TE will have more opportunities to participate in the initiative and contribute to its success.

One day, Li and Miduo were traveling on Beijing's Subway Line Two, which follows the route of the old city wall, when the girl asked, "Why do so many stops have the word men (gate) in their names?"
The question puzzled Li. He knew that eight subway stations were named after various dismantled gates, but he had no idea why.
Recently, I had a special experience that personally connected me to both the Chinese Dream and the long sweep of Chinese history when I was honored to be a host-presenter in Shenzhen for the Confucius-Mencius Foundation (CMF) and meet descendants of the two sages, Confucius and Mencius.
The Chinese Dream of course is all about the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, once the world’s most powerful, but in recent centuries subject to humiliation by foreign countries.
In America something is “old” if it dates back a century. Some places like Harvard University founded in 1636 is practically pre-historic for the country. In China, with a history of millennia, this is a mere speck in time!
In preparing for the Confucius-Mencius Foundation forum, I was reminded that Confucius was active more than 2,000 years ago during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BC). He was what we call today a Renaissance man as a philosopher, teacher, editor and public servant. His teachings emphasized personal and governmental morality, justice and sincerity. He is perhaps best known as the originator of the Golden Rule - “Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself” - which centuries later was incorporated into Judeo-Christian and Muslim core beliefs.

Mencius, who lived after the death of Confucius, was a teacher, evangelist and extender of Confucian thought. One cannot be divorced from the other as both were a team, albeit separated in time, but not in spirit.
The goal of the Confucius-Mencius Foundation is to nourish core Chinese ancient values and virtues in order to make China and Chinese culture great again.
What was so meaningful to me was that the thoughts of Confucius and Mencius weren’t merely present in dusty old tablets and books, but in the living embodiment of their descendants and co-founders of the Confucius-Mencius Foundation. Kong Ren, 78th generation direct descendent of Confucius and Meng Liang, 79th generation direct descendent of Mencius.
Kong Ren said that the foundation creates a good social atmosphere by advocating ideas of respect, filial piety, honesty and related values. He said that it is committed to pursuing a world of peace, harmony and diversity through cultural exchanges and cooperation with other civilizations. Meng Liang said that one goal is to build China’s soft power by establishing 50 Confucius-Mencius Academies on every continent.
I was honored to meet and interview CMF Ambassador of Chinese Civilizations former Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, who displayed great moral strength and humility in assuming office when much of his country’s leadership died in a tragic plane crash, and CMF Cultural Ambassador Mishal Kanoo, chairman of one of the largest and most successful family-owned businesses in the Arab world.

You wouldn’t think that Confucian influence extends 20,000 km from China but it does according to Uruguay Ambassador Fernando Lugris. He spoke about the increasingly close bilateral cultural and economic ties, especially since the state visit to China of President Tabare Vazquez last year.
Serving as host-presenter was not only an honor for me but meeting the descendants of Confucius and Mencius and three outstanding leaders continuing to carry on the noble work of their ancestors was truly inspirational.

Palm Beach museum curator manages to infuse a love of Chinese art in an all-American town
Laurie Barnes is one of the few people who get to do what they love, and get paid for it. She has worked for decades as a curator to promote Chinese art in Palm Beach, a southern Florida town where not so many Chinese people live. And yet Barnes, in her 60s now, feels rewarded for helping American people understand China a little more every day.
"I tell people that the 20th century is the American century, the 19th century was the British century, but the 21st century is going to be the Chinese century. So I think everyone in the world should be interested in Chinese culture because it's China's time," said Barnes.
In love with Chinese culture
When she was a kid, Barnes would go for six weeks in the summer time to her grandparents' house in the Washington D.C. area. She loved visiting museums, including her favorite Freer Gallery of Art then.
"There was just something magical about Chinese art that really spoke to me," she said. Later she decided to make it a career to learn about the objects she knew little about when she was a child and help other people appreciate them.
She started working for the Norton Museum of Art in Palm Beach in 2006 as Elizabeth B. Mcgraw curator of Chinese art, hoping to help expand the museum's Chinese collection and make them more accessible to the public.
The museum has had a Chinese collection for over half a century. Over the years, the collection grew from the initial 125 objects to about 600, ranging from delicately-carved jade, paintings, Buddha statues, and a few porcelain pieces.
Barnes said the exhibition came into being because the museum's founder Ralph Norton wanted to represent something other than Western art, and chose to focus on Chinese art.
One of Barnes' responsibilities as a curator is to present the permanent collection to visitors in an accessible way. It is not an easy job in a city that is traditionally American.
"In Chinese culture, dragons can bring good luck, they are not scary," Barnes told a group of visitors, most of whom were kids, in front of two dragon roof ridge fascia panels. They are made of earthenware, decorated with amber, the eyes of the dragon glaring in the light.
Barnes compared the dragons to "puppy dogs playing with flaming jewels," which almost immediately brought the school-aged children intimacy with this legendary animal from the Far East.
"This is my kids' first time to see this type of exhibition in a museum, I think they are enjoying it, the dragons are cool for my son," said Fabiola Williams, a young mother visiting with her two kids.
"If you can get people to start looking, and give them some information, create a story around it, they will enjoy it," said Barnes, adding that she tried to engage a wide spectrum of people.
The museum launches special programs on important Chinese holidays such as the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Scott Benarde, the museum's director of communication, told Xinhua that over 2,000 people came in one day for the Chinese New Year last time, while 600 or 700 people came for the Mid-Autumn festival.
"I would say people are interested," said Benarde. "It "s hard not to walk into our Chinese collection and look at that giant head of a Buddha, and just not be awed and thrown, no matter who."
Making Chinese culture more exciting
However, Barnes still sees visitors walking past precious objects not knowing the value in them. To make Chinese art more exciting, she also launches special exhibitions and lecture series that highlight the collection.
She once ran an exhibition on the impact of tea culture worldwide since many of her favorite pieces of ceramics are connected with tea.
She chose eight tea countries to focus on but emphasized China's influence.
"In terms of the impact of tea and impact of ceramics, to my mind, all roads lead back to China, and I made the exhibition that way," she said.
The exhibition was well-received. "There are still people coming up to the entrance desk and saying 'who did that exhibition. I'll never forget it. It was one of the greatest exhibitions I've ever seen,'" Barnes said.
She spent three years of her life on it and felt really gratified to have that kind of public response.
Barnes also likes to talk about a rabbit pendant made of jade in public tours.
"It's so tiny that people would never look at it unless I do. So I try to tell people how it would have been used, who would have used it, why jade is important to the Chinese people," she said.
If she's not in the exhibition hall talking and answering questions, she will be in the office to study more about each object.
Her office is a wonderland for anyone interested in art. In just five square meters, she fit in as many Chinese elements as possible.
The wooden floor has a bamboo layer on it, which reminds one of the decorations of a traditional Chinese tea house. A gongfu tea set was placed on the table beside the computer while several porcelain tea cups and mini zisha (purple clay) tea pots were laid out neatly on the bookshelf.
The books, including ones on ceramics that she published, art auction catalogs, and Chinese art and history chronicles, took the rest of the space.
Closer US-China cultural exchanges in recent years have made Barnes' research work more exciting.
The museum's Chinese collection comes primarily from dealers in the early 20th century without context. Sometimes the curators are not sure whether an object is real or fake. The important archaeological discoveries in China in recent years have been incredibly helpful for Barnes to study the collection.
"The excavation of imperial kilns in Jingdezhen really changed our understanding of 14th century and early 15th century ceramics," said Barnes.
She is now working on an exhibition of porcelain from Jingdezhen, a city in China's Jiangxi province famous for porcelain making, looking for ways to tackle the challenge that the American public don't know how to appreciate broken pieces.
"I think with anything, if you can get people to start looking, and give them some information, create a story around it, they will enjoy it," said Barnes.

British singer Vera Lynn will celebrate her 100th birthday by releasing an album of remastered classic songs next month, which could make the wartime singer the first centenarian to hit the UK charts.
The artist known as the "Forces sweetheart" will release Vera Lynn 100, which will include hits such as We'll Meet Again and Sailing set to new orchestral accompaniment, on March 17, three days ahead of her milestone birthday.
There are also plans for a concert on March 18 to raise money for her children's charity.
"It's truly humbling that people still enjoy these songs from so many years ago, reliving the emotions of that time," Lynn said in a statement.
"I was after all just doing my job as a singer - and it's so wonderful for me to hear my songs again so beautifully presented in a completely new way."
Through her songs, Lynn became a symbol of hope for British and Allied soldiers fighting Nazi Germany and she was given the title of Dame in 1975 for her work.
In 2009, aged 92, Lynn became the oldest living artist to land a UK No 1 album with a compilation release called We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn.
The album also made her the only recording artist to have spanned the pop charts from the 1940s to the 21st century.
Lynn has described turning 100 as "an incredible adventure of song, dance and friendship".

Hong Kong-born Londoner Emma-Lee Moss, better known to fans as "Emmy the Great", is of to China next year to take part in a six-week musicians-in-residence program organized by the British Council and the PRS for Music Foundation, the UK's leading founder of new music.
"This is so amazing," Moss told China Daily. "I grew up in Hong Kong but I have never been to the Chinese mainland and to be given this opportunity through this program is very special."
Moss, 33, was born to a British father and Chinese mother and moved to England with her family when she was 11.
Between April and June, she and two other UK-based artists will spend time in three Chinese cities. Moss, who sings in English and Cantonese and has released three studio albums since 2009, will be based in the coastal city of Xiamen in the southeast.
The performer, who wrote the original score for the Sony Pictures film Austenland and who contributed original music for Mystery Show, the number one podcast in the US in 2015, hopes her time in China will help her improve her Mandarin skills.
"I want to produce music through language and use the words to tell a story, which I think makes it more interesting," she said.
Irish musician David Lyttle, who will be in residence in the eastern city of Suzhou, and multi-instrumentalist Quinta, who will be based in Guiyang in China's southwest, will travel with Moss.
Lyttle told China Daily: "This is a fantastic experience. Coming from a jazz and Irish-folk music background, I'm interested in working with classical Chinese music and mixing all the influences together into a new sound."
During their time in China the three will meet local musicians and exchange ideas, create new work and build cultural bonds.

Kevin Tsai or Cai Kangyong, the host of the popular Taiwan comedy talk show "Kangxi Lai Le", has announces on his weibo that he is to leave the show.
Tsai writes that he wants to do something different after hosting the show for 12 years.
Soon afterwards, Dee Hsu, co-host of the show hinted that she want to throw in her lot with Tsai.
"Kangxi Lai Le" was first aired in January 2004.
In most episodes, the hosts interview a panel of celebrities on various controversial topics while employing their signature comic bantering.
Although it is broadcast in Taiwan, the show is very popular among Chinese speaking audiences across the world, who watch uploaded re-runs over the internet.
Beijing Mobike Technology Co Ltd, one of the leading bike-sharing companies in China, announced the launch of China's first urban mobility open research institute on Wednesday, in a move to promote the construction of smart cities in China.
Relying on Mobike's big data and artificial intelligence platform, the research institute will be backed by 11 institutions and organizations, including the Research Institute of Highway Ministry of Transport, Institute for China Sustainable Urbanization, Tsinghua University, College of Transportation Engineering, Tongji University and Beijing Municipal of City Planning and Design.
Mobike Chief Technology Officer Xia Yiping said the new institute will help the company gain more strength to drive innovations on urban computing.
"We will work closely with those top think tanks and institutes, exploring innovative ways for sustainable urbanization in terms of traffic management, driving green trips, urban planning and so fort
With the support of Mobike's big data and AI platform, "Magic Cube", the company is able to integrate and analyze hundreds of factors, such as geography, time, weather and capacity, to forecast the number of needed bikes in every specific location in the future, said Yin Dafei, chief scientist at Mobike Data Group.
"The platform will offer smart guidance for bike delivery, dispatch, operation and maintenance. Then we can offer better customer services," Yin said.
Mobike has deployed more than 1 million intelligent bikes for registered users from over 150 countries. It has provided over 400 million accumulated rides since its debut in 2016, according to company figures.

SHANGHAI - Mobike on Tuesday launched its bicycle-sharing service in Singapore, its first expansion overseas.
Bikes are mostly placed around the MRT stations and on university campuses. Users download the Mobike app and unlock the bikes by scanning the QR code on the frame.
China's leading bicycle-sharer said the standard rental fee is S$1 per half an hour. To celebrate the launch, it offers a 50 percent temporary discount.
Hu Weiwei, founder and president of the company, said Mobike will bring its bikes to more cities worldwide and make biking a more convenient and cheaper commute.
Florian Bohnert, head of international expansion at Mobike, said the bike-sharing had been welcomed by local residents, business partners and transport authorities during a trial period.
Bohnert said Mobike was happy to work with universities in Singapore to encourage more students and teachers to ride its bikes on campus.
Mobike has secured more than $300 million of investment since January this year, with Singapore's Temasek being the newest investor.
Mobike's CEO Wang Xiaofeng said in February that the company would use the money to explore the global market and duplicate its business model elsewhere.
Mobike and its market rival ofo have revolutionized China's commuting market with their app-based bicycle sharing services.
Mobike has more than 1 million bicycles in 33 cities in China. A total of 400 million rides have been recorded since the company launched its first service in Shanghai 11 months ago.
Bike-sharing firm hopes funding can help it expand in China and overseas
Chinese bike-sharing startup Mobike announced on Monday it has received a strategic investment injection from Singaporean company Temasek Holdings, as it is locked in a fierce battle with Ofo for dominance in China.
With the deal the three-year-old company has raised more than $300 million since the start of 2017. Mobike did not disclose the specific amount.
Davis Wang, co-founder and CEO of Mobike, said within just 10 months, the Beijing-based company has accumulated more than 10 million users across 21 cities. In the same time frame, it has provided more than 200 million bike-sharing rides.
"With the help of new investors, we will expand presence in China and the overseas markets," he added.
Hillhouse Capital, a leading investment powerhouse, also increased its bet in the company after it led an investment into Mobike in late 2016.
Zhang Lei, founder and chief executive of Hillhouse Capital, said in a statement that the Mobike team has a clear vision for the future of urban transport.
"We look forward to leveraging our global network and resources to help Mobike bring its urban transportation solution to cities around the world."
The new investment came shortly after Mobike signed an exclusive strategic partnership with Foxconn Technology Group in January, which would help double its annual bicycle production capacity to more than 10 million units.
Mobike is competing with Ofo for supremacy in the country's booming bike-sharing sector, which is now one of the most popular investment destinations.
In January, Mobike raised $215 million from investors including the social networking giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, while Ofo clinched an investment of $130 million in October 2016.
In the first week of 2017, Mobike's mobile app had 5.85 million weekly active users. In comparison, the number for Ofo is 1.4 million, data from the research firm iResearch Consulting Group show.
The cash-burning battle between ride-sharing platforms is continuing as they are attracting new users with subsidies, according to Zhang Xu, a Beijing-based transport analyst for internet consultancy Analysys.
"The two sides are all armed with enough cash now. The competition will depend on which can offer better services with lower costs," he said.
"Local governments are preparing to unveil regulation policies. Players need to pay attention to that," he added.

China's cycle startup Ofo has announced plans to bring its stand-free bike-sharing service to three international destinations.


Ofo－pronounced "oh-efoh"－has chosen Cambridge for its entry point into Europe and next month 500 of the company's yellow and black bikes, ubiquitous in China's urban centers, will dot the streets of the university town. Located in the fl at Fenlands area, Cambridge is commonly referred to as the UK's unofficial "cycle city".
"We chose Cambridge because it's so bike-friendly," Ofo head of communications Angela Cai said. "Research shows that one-third of the city's population rides bicycles to go to school or work. It's the highest rate in the UK, so there's a high demand."
Ofo is Beijing Bikelock Technology's mobile app-supported bike-sharing scheme, partially funded by Lei Jun who founded smartphone company Xiaomi, and Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing service that acquired Uber's China operation last year.
Starting of in 2014 on college campuses, Ofo now operates across more than 22 cities and is China's second-largest bike-sharing service, valued at $500 million with roughly 5 million registered users. The bike-sharing market in China has become increasingly crowded－more than a dozen services vie for the country's cyclists. Mobike, partially owned by Tencent Holdings, had 72.5 percent of the market share in 2016, according to a report by Trustdata.
Late last year, Ofo chief executive Dai Wei announced plans to ship 20,000 bicycles abroad, choosing three foreign destinations from which to launch the firm's global expansion: Cambridge, Singapore, and Stanford in California.
"We hope that the UK will serve as a gateway for our business in Europe, and Singapore for our business in South-east Asia," Cai said.
Bike-sharing schemes are not new to the UK. Thousands of Londoners get around daily on Santander Cycles, commonly referred to as "Boris bikes" named after former London mayor Boris Johnson, who launched the scheme. Cambridge did have a bike-sharing program in the early 1990s but it was quickly abandoned as most of the 300 bicycles were stolen within a year.
Ofo differs to most of Europe's public bike-sharing programs in several ways. The service does not use docking stations－users are free to pick up bikes wherever they find them and leave them wherever they please. Riders use the Ofo app－now available for download in English－to scan a QR code or enter a bike registration number to gain access to a bike lock combination code. Users can search for nearby bikes on the app, and at night, a service will collect bikes and redistribute them to high-use areas.
Ofo rides also come cheap－one trip will cost just 50 pence ($0.63) in the UK and $1 in the US. In comparison, Santander Cycle hire starts at 2 pounds ($2.5).
The Cambridge operation will start with 500 bikes and Ofo will later decide on further expansion after a trial phase, which it expects will commence mid-March.
"We have to make sure that we consider all aspects, including testing the rides and getting feedback from users before we roll in more bikes," Cai said.
Around 40 percent of adults cycle at least three times a week in Cambridge, the highest rate of any British region and more than double that of the Isles of Scilly, in second place with 19 percent, according to Cycle UK.
Ofo conducted meetings with, and gained the support of, the Greater Cambridge Greater Peterborough Enterprise Partnership (GCGP) and Cambridgeshire County Council.
"The City of Cambridge was obviously attractive to Ofo as the UK's cycling capital and obviously any increase in cycling has environmental benefits and helps to reduce traffic congestion in the city center," said Steven Wilson, head of innovation at GCGP.




 
Chinese bike-share startup Bluegogo, which had planned to fill San Francisco's public bike racks with rental bicycles, is seeking permits after drawing backlash from city leaders.
The Beijing-based company has recently faces resistance in its first US market – San Francisco, which is home to other share-economy innovations like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.
Different from other bike-share programs, Bluegogo's bikes are equipped with smart locks and GPS, which allows riders to locate and unlock the bikes using their smart phones and leave them at any public bike rack without locking. The service costs only 99 cents per half hour.
The company had planned to launch the program last month, but city leaders vowed to impound their bicycles and fine the company if they go ahead without permission.
The city official, who called Bluegogo a "rogue" company, were worried that the company would "dump" tens of thousands of bikes that would clutter public sidewalks. Bluegogo does not reveal how many bicycles it plans to deposit in the city.
"Every single time, these arrogant tech companies ask later for forgiveness, or ask later for permission. This is the first time where San Francisco has gotten ahead of the curve," Supervisor Aaron Peskin said at a press conference on Jan 18.
A month earlier, Uber faced a similar conflict with the city for its unpermitted self-driving car program. After a weeklong standoff, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the cars' registrations and forced them off the road.
"We'd still really like to come to an agreement with the city regarding the use of public racks," Ilya Movshovich, Bluegogo's vice president of US operations, told China Daily in an email.
"We last met with the city on Jan 25 and are still waiting to hear back on what permits might be needed. In the next week we will be bringing out more bikes to be housed at our rented-out stations," said Movshovich.
Currently, the company is operating bike-rent program with less than 200 bikes parked in rented private parking spots.
Bluegogo is reported to have put 130,000 bikes on the streets of China's Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. But media reports said similar bike-share programs have caused problems in China, such as fights for limited curb space and damaged bikes that were thrown into piles and turned into dumping grounds.
Peskin also said on Jan 18 that he was drafting an ordinance to make it easier to go after Bluegogo, according to media reports. Under the state's existing Unfair Competition Law, Peskin said Bluegogo could be liable for fines of up to $2,500 per day, per violation.
He didn't immediately respond to request for comment.

In this season, 23-year-old Olympic athlete Dong Li is designated as "father" to 4-year-old Cui Yahan. He takes care of the little girl several days a week, eats and sleeps with her, and is present when she bathes.
The pair has spawned thousands of so-called "CP" or "couple" fans -- people who believe certain TV characters are meant to be together romantically.
They point to one scene in which Yahan tells Dong that when she grows up, she wants to marry him, as well as to an interview in which Dong says his dream girl is Arale, Yahan's nickname.
The show's production company, Mango TV, fanned the flames by posting an online video clip set to a love song and captioned "Dong and Arale's interpretation of 'Let's Fall in Love,'" referring to a famous Chinese dating show. Mango TV is the online division of Hunan TV, one of China's largest television channels.
However, the pair's popularity has triggered worries among parents and experts. Some have claimed that the popularity of the show may mislead the public about appropriate adult-child relationships and make children vulnerable.
A mother-to-be published an open letter on China's microblog service Sina Weibo, expressing her anger that the show's producers have edited the show to make the pair look like a couple.
"If she were your daughter, would you ever let her stay with a strange man wearing only underwear? Would you ever allow a 23-year-old man to tell the media that his ideal type for a girlfriend is your 3-year-old daughter?" the woman wrote.
The woman is also a volunteer with Girl Protection, a public welfare program under the Children's Safety Fund of the China Social Assistance Foundation.
Statistics from Girl Protection indicate that in 2015, the media exposed 314 cases of sexual abuse against children in China, and 85 percent of these sexual abuse cases were perpetrated by someone the child knows.
Others are quick to defend the show against the accusations.
"I don't think the pair is creepy. They are so adorable. Please don't exaggerate just to scare the public," said Weibo user "Guaishoupitaohezuoshe."
"The clips of Dong's words were intended to show his paternal love, but these clips were distorted and interpreted out of context, misleading netizens and causing invisible harm to children," according to the statement.
The statement added that Dong never stays alone with the girl. Cameras are placed everywhere, and the girl has a female director to help her change her clothes and bathe, it said.
"We hope more people can focus on the innocence of the children and the paternal love of their 'intern' fathers," the statement said.
The explanation, however, has irritated some experts in the girl protection field. People took to the keyboard to demand the issue be taken seriously.
Jiang Jing, procurator at the Jinniu District Procuratorate in Chengdu city in Southwest China's Sichuan province, wrote an article on the official Minors Procuratorate account on WeChat.
To Jiang, the show sets a bad example for sex education and is too flippant in its treatment of the safety risks girls face.
"As a reality show that has been viewed up to 350 million times on the Internet, the program should have done better," Jiang said, urging the show to thoroughly weigh its influence on children and consult experts in education and child psychology.
"Child protection should be the priority when showing the intimacy and the 'love' between the 'intern' father-daughter pair," said Jiang.
Chinese-Canadian singer-actor Wu Yifan, known to his fans as Kris Wu, has released a documentary that goes backstage at his 26th birthday party.
The party was streamed live online, and has attracted over 16 million views.
Born in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, Wu immigrated to Vancouver at ten years old with his mother.
He started his music career with South Korean-Chinese boy group, EXO.
In 2014, he launched his solo career, which has ranged from music and movies to the fashion industries.

As most cities in China have shivered through their first snowfall this week, some seemed to be caught unprepared by the sudden drop in temperature.
In the face of the cold, putting on extra layers and trousers will definitely be the first steps by the majority of those who fear the cold.
However, as a fashion insider, I know that you can't stand being wrapped in thick clothes like a moving dumpling even in winter. It will make you look plump and countrified, right?
Hey, if you cannot show off your slim figures at the moment, why don't you try something different and bold? After all, the rate of second glances means something to you.
According to Sina Weibo user Huaze Meimei, pairs of made-in-Russia woolen pants have engulfed the foreign market.
"The pants are made from wools of Orenbury, a group of goats dwelling in Orenburg in Russia. Soft and light, the wools are as slender as silk. Boasting a low heat-conducting property, they are not easy to catch fire, and you can feel free to try them on," the user said.
Actually, Orenbury wools are first-class material for making clothes. Similar to qualified cony hairs, they are favored by Nurnberg manufacturers that make capes in Germany. Many countries, including Britain, tried to introduce the Orenbury to their countries, but all ended in failure.

In 2010, Hong opened the first store of BNC, which gathered more than 150 Chinese designers, at Beijing's Sanlitun area, a popular place for young people in the capital. For the new store, BNC will be transformed into a venue that combines a store, restaurants and exhibition halls.
On Nov 12 and 13, Hong joined hands with an enterprise called Norlha, which is from Zorgey Ritoma, a village situated in Gannan Tibetan autonomous prefecture, Gansu province.
Not just presenting designers' products, BNC has expanded into introducing the knowledge and philosophy behind the brand.
During the runway shows held at BNC's store of Sanlitun, models displayed clothes and accessories made of yak wool.
"Since BNC advocates China's local fashion designers, we want to tell the story from a more diversified angle," said Hong.

On Sunday morning, one day ahead of the launch, the two astronauts, 49-year-old Jing Haipeng and 37-year-old Chen Dong, met reporters during a news briefing at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. In addition to their space mission, the new astronaut suits they wore were also in the limelight.
The new uniforms, worn by astronauts while working on Earth, features different shades of navy blue - inspired by the color of the skyline and space, according to the the Astronaut Center of China's spacesuit laboratory. The V-shaped pattern on the chest carries an auspicious meaning of "victory" in each mission.
The suits are among the newly unveiled autumn and winter series for astronauts, using thick woolen fabric to maintain warmth. Others include outdoor training suits and winter coats.
Since May 2015, China's Astronaut Center has begun to design astronauts' attire, including on-orbit suits, on-ground suits and accessories.
Prince Edward Island in Canada draws visitors with its beautiful beaches, fresh seafood and activities to experience as an islander. [Photo provided to China Daily]
The smallest province in Canada, Prince Edward Island is known for its beautiful beaches, delicious food and world-class golf facilities.
It is a must-visit place for foodies, who can sample fresh seafood, ranging from lobster and oysters to mussels.
Visitors can also experience hiking and cycling, or join artisans and musicians to experience life as an islander.
"Tourism is very important to our economy. We attach great importance to the Chinese market and see an increase of Chinese visitors to the island in recent years," says Heath MacDonald, the province's minister of Economic Development and Tourism, who recently visited Beijing.
The island is home to about 150,000 residents and had about 1.5 million visitors in 2016, 90.9 percent of whom were domestic.
The total tourism expenditure in the province last year was about $430 million.
The minister says that they are working with Chinese tour operators and travel bloggers to promote the island in China, and they are also integrating Mandarin speakers into the tourism industry for the convenience of Chinese visitors.
"About 10 percent of our university and post-secondary students are Chinese, and the local Chinese community is also growing. So, it is a good base for us to attract Chinese visitors," says MacDonald.
According to him, China is the island's second-largest trading partner after the United States, and 80 percent of its exports to China comprise lobsters.
The island's lobster is known for its hard shell and juicy meat.
Speaking about what Chinese visitors want, he says: "For them, the major trend is experience tourism, and that is also what we are catering to. It is not just about sightseeing. They want to go lobster fishing and dig clams on a guided kayak tour. They like to have lobster dinners on the beach and cook lobsters on open fires, with live music and wine," he says.
He adds that as the middle class in China grows, it wants to broaden its horizons through overseas travel.
In February, Air Canada started a flight between Shanghai and Montreal, and the minister believes this is a big benefit for Prince Edward Island as a destination because Montreal is less than two hours by air from the island.

An emerald-green 1970 Mercedes-Benz enters a red-brick driveway lined with swaying palm trees, a gentleman in white pants gets out, puts on his hat, softly flips his blazer, and walks into a hall of splendor. This is a common scene at the Breakers, a top-notch luxury hotel at Palm Beach, Florida. If we call Downton Abbey a period drama, then Palm Beach is a "period island" of the Gilded Age.
Stretching 26 kilometers from north to south, the island of Palm Beach is connected with the rest of Palm Beach County by three bridges. Seen from above, it is like a little gem floating on the turquoise waters. And it hangs on to its past glory.
"You don't wear white between Labor Day and Memorial Day, except on Palm Beach," goes a fashion saying in the United States. That speaks volume of the town's character.
Founded as a resort escape for the elites back in the late 1800s, the island saw a growing convergence of wealthy people in the 1910s and 1920s due to its warm winter.
"This started the historical development of Palm Beach being the wealthiest community in United States," says Rick Rose, a local historian who lives in Palm Beach County.
At that time, only the wealthy, or at least upper-class Americans, could afford to travel. They built boutique hotels, golf courses, and mansions. Their way of life continues to this day. During peak seasons, there are extravagant balls almost every night.
Edwin Muniz, assistant front office manager of the Brazilian Court, one of the well known boutique hotels on Palm Beach, says: "People here are more like old-money, established wealth."
Guests usually stay at Brazilian Court when they are on long vacations, say four to five weeks. "The rates are high, and the guests are very demanding, they expect high-quality service," says Muniz.
An increasing number of migratory birds, including some species on the endangered list, are overwintering at the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve, an important avian habitat on an island in the Yangtze River estuary.
Located to the north of Shanghai, Chongming is China's third-largest island, after Taiwan and Hainan. Overdevelopment of the river in recent decades has had a disastrous effect on the local ecosystem, so Chongming has made ecology a priority. It is aided by the municipal government, which is actively promoting environmental protection, energy conservation and sustainable development.
As of mid-January, 28,264 birds from 43 species had been tracked arriving at the 242-square-kilometer reserve on the eastern end of the island, treating it either as a brief stopover during migration or as a winter base, according to official data.
This winter, a number of protected species, such as hooded cranes, common cranes, whistling swans and rare Chinese mergansers that had long disappeared from the region, have shown up on the wetland.
The broader picture shows that 290 species have been tracked on Dongtan, and more than 300,000 birds shelter there every year, which activists attribute to the high level of eco-protection at the reserve and on the island generally.
To protect biodiversity in the Dongtan Nature Reserve, the regional authorities have been working on wetland restoration and weeding out harmful, nonnative plants, educating the public and cracking down on poaching.
Jin Weiguo, 56, a rural resident of Chongming, has been protecting the birds at the reserve for more than a decade.

Wine production worldwide is estimated at 259 million hectoliters(Mhl) in 2016, down five percent compared to that of 2015, the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) announced here on Thursday.
According to OIV, global wine consumption is estimated to reach between 239.7 and 246.6 Mhl.
Italy will be the world's leading wine producer, with a production volume of 48.8 Mhl. It is followed by France and Spain, respectively at 41.9 Mhl and 37.8 Mhl, OIV estimated.
As the fourth largest wine producer this year, production in the United States is estimated to reach a new record level in 2016, or 22.5 Mhl, while Australia's production is estimated at 12.5 Mhl, up five percent compared to 2015 and is relatively stable over the period from 2012 to 2015, according to OIV.
China, a major new world wine market, maintained its production level of 11.5 Mhl in 2016, securing its place as the world's sixth largest wine producer, OIV said.
In South America, the output of three main producers, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, is in net decline, said the organization, adding Argentina registered in 2016 a sharp decline with a production of 8.8 Mhl, 35 percent less than that of 2015.
At the same time, wine production in Chile this year is expected to fall down to 10.1 million hectoliters, a level very close to that of 2014 (10.5 million hl), registering a significant decline relative to the 12.9 Mhl wine it produced in 2015. Brazil's production has fell down to 1.4 Mhl in 2016, a decrease of 50 percent compared to 2015, OIV said, explaining that the production of the three countries was affected by climatic events.
South Africa, with a production of 9.1 Mhl, saw its production level in 2016 decline by 19 percent from 2015, according to OIV.




 
I'm not normally one for early starts. But the breakfast in Yangzhou is something to wake up early for, I'm assured by my Chinese colleagues.
And so, on a brief trip to the historical city, I find myself up before the sun preparing to tuck in to something I've never tried before－zao cha.
Zao cha, or early breakfast tea, is something of an institution in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. It is an early-morning meal where delicious small treats are served with a variety of steaming hot teas.
You might say it sounds similar to any other breakfast ritual that takes place throughout the world－that's where you'd be wrong. Zao cha in Yangzhou is a traditional, cultural and overwhelmingly social event.
As the soporific effects of the night before wear off, I descend a case of winding steps which take me to a sunken quadrangle, hemmed in by ornate Qing Dynasty buildings. I am immediately struck by how many people are crammed into the space below－my interest is piqued. Over to the left a squadron of elderly men and women, probably fitter than me, perform tai chi in unison. To the right, another hefty group sit on benches chatting and listening to Yangzhou ditties. Straight ahead is what they are all here waiting for, the true purpose－Ye Chun Teahouse.
Ye Chun was first established in 1877 as a place for Yangzhou locals to enjoy good tea and good food. Over the years the restaurant has become synonymous with zao cha, with people lining up in the early hours to get a table so they can enjoy the food, the hot tea and most importantly a good chat with friends.
Luckily for me, a Chinese colleague managed to wangle us a table and so we were able to go straight inside. Just as the decor of the restaurant carries a distinct and intricate woody theme, so does the aroma, the smell of earthy steeped tea filling the air.
The World's 50 Best Restaurants recently announced that its 2017 awards will take place in Melbourne, Australia, on April 5, as it has partnered with Tourism Australia to bring the series to the city's historic Royal Exhibition Building.
World-leading chefs, restaurateurs, sommeliers, media and opinion leaders will gather to celebrate the very best in global gastronomy. The overall event program, running from April 1 to 7, will showcase Australia’s outstanding food and wine culture to an international audience of industry professionals and food lovers.
Two restaurants in China made the global list in 2016: Hong Kong's Amber (No 20) and Shanghai's Ultraviolet (No 42).
John O'Sullivan, managing director with Tourism Australia, said in a news release that next year's awards and event program provide a natural extension to its Restaurant Australia campaign.
"Great culinary experiences are about people, produce and place," he said.
One of Australia's most internationally acclaimed gourmet celebrations, the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival, plans to align its dates with The World's Best 50 Restaurants 2017. That program of events, in its 25th year, will run from March 31 to April 9, including a master class series celebrating The World's 50 Best Restaurants on April 1 to 2.
Wine Australia will provide top wines throughout the program.

As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd said that the C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, is set to become the new star of its 600-plus aircraft fleet, stating that its "safety and state-of-the-art design will bring superb a flying experience to its passengers".
In a written reply to China Daily, the Shanghai-based airline, which is expected to be the first carrier to take delivery of the homegrown single-aisle passenger jet, said it was "extremely confident about the future of the C919".
China Eastern pre-ordered 20 C919s from the aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd in 2010, and according to the purchase agreement, negotiations for the ordering of the first five planes will be launched within a year of the C919's maiden flight.
China Eastern is one of the nation's top three airlines, serving more than 100 million passengers in flights to 177 nations and regions in 1,062 destinations every year.
ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, the subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, announced its intention to purchase 45 C919 aircraft in October 2011. ICBC Financial Leasing is looking to support COMAC with joint marketing, market surveys, signing more orders and all-around financial services in the future, said Xu Qing, deputy CEO of ICBC Leasing.
"C919 will serve the most attractive market. The aircraft will be used in the domestic market, the Asia-Pacific region and the African market in its early days. By continuously optimizing the aircraft's performance, the C919 will go global in the future," said Xu.
With regard to the two dominant commercial aircraft makers－Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE－she suggested the future C919 should pay more attention to service at the beginning to build up its brand first.
"It's important to pay attention to customer support and services, and enhance product quality and stability. Overseas marketing should be based on continuously optimized products and services, an efficient maintenance support, and efficiency of operations," said Xu.
Jan Rinnert, chairman of Heraeus, a family-owned German company engaged in precious and special metals, sensors, specialty light sources, quartz glass and medical technology PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Led by Jan Rinnert, Germany's Heraeus expects China's initiative to spawn digital infrastructure
Overseeing a business as tough as precious metal recycling, thick film pastes and water decontamination, Jan Rinnert, chairman of German technology company Heraeus, has long recognized the importance of adding a human touch to his management philosophy.
It may have been derived from his earlier experience as a local government spokesperson, where he grasped the art of articulating a view, or, later, as a management consultant role in which he learned a slew of business best practices.
"I've always believed in the power in people. My father once told me never to look for a job, but to search for the right individual that you report to and learn from," he said.
Since taking the helm of the one of the most renowned family-run companies in Germany, Rinnert strives to become the "approachable" leader and role model for his 12,500 employees around the globe.
His frankness in leadership is exemplified by a number of initiatives to engage with staff, such as the "open space dialogue" where employees get to raise thorny questions from the outlook of the European Union to personal distractions.
"I was once asked by a Chinese colleague if our businesses would be dragged down by the gloomy outlook of the European Union following Brexit. That's when you realize they are absolutely the most valuable assets of the company," he said.
Founded in 1851 in Hanau, a city near Frankfurt, Heraeus may not be a household name, but it has a sizable presence globally by virtue of its business, which is providing materials and solutions to markets like environment, energy, health and transport. It also provides industrial applications from power electronics systems to electric vehicles, and engages in trading in precious metals such as platinum and gold.
Like many of its German peers, Heraeus is a "Hidden Champion"－a term coined by management consultant Hermann Simon to describe smaller companies that are among the top three of a niche market－with the only problem being it has grown a bit too big to be invisible now.
Sales in 2016 topped $20 billion with a satisfying level of margin, according to Rinnert, whose company does not disclose financial details and chooses to stay private.
"As a family(-run) company, we've never considered an initial public offering. Diversification remains a route to long-term growth. Under one roof, we aim to run eight hidden champions that are all independent, all leaders in their respective niche markets, while leveraging the company's synergies to grow along," he said.
That vision, in part, was made possible thanks to an overhaul plan led by Rinnert in 2014 to turn Heraeus into a portfolio company, by making business units more market-oriented and eliminating several levels of hierarchy.
Today, its portfolio ranges from components to coordinated material systems used in a wide variety of industries, including steel, electronics, chemical, automotive and telecommunications.
But this does not indicate an inward-looking business strategy. Its latest acquisition of Swiss precious metal processor Argor-Heraeus in April would help kick up a notch in processing capacity for gold and silver.
The buyout accords with an earlier investment in China, where Heraeus broke ground for a plant in Nanjing last year to boost capacity in recycling precious metals and manufacturing chemicals, to grow its local market share to 20 percent by 2020.
As the largest precious metals company in the world and one of the very few companies licensed to trade in precious metals in China, Heraeus has been present in the country for 40 years and generates 30 percent of its entire revenue from here.
In the eyes of Rinnert, the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) has laid a solid ground for Chinese companies to embark on technological breakthroughs and shed over-capacities through the supply-side structural reform, guidelines that are in line with what his company could offer.
"Retaining existing technology is not an option－that's the key learning from my family business. That's not easy because you are challenging the status quo. But automation, advanced manufacturing, and other things Chinese are doing is the way ahead to make businesses sustain," he said.
The Belt and Road Initiative will lend new momentum to growth, he said. "It's a visionary initiative. Today, it's more focused on physical infrastructure investment, with substantial financial systems in place such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as the cornerstone. In the future, we look forward to the digital and data infrastructure building where there is a larger role for us to play."
Rinnert further said the initiative would require extra efforts and coordination for public-private partnerships. It is a subject where Europe has experience and can share that with China.
But it is still the forthcoming cultural and people-to-people exchanges that matter the most, he said.
"I often recall my first startup company that hosted a number of DJs prior to college. That experience helped me deal with pressure, and know my strengths and limits. Today, I see the younger generation in China who are well-educated, digital-savvy and understand the complexity of the environment. I've a lot to expect from you."
Mainland authorities call for thorough probe, ask that fishermen be respected
Mainland authorities called on Taiwan to thoroughly investigate the shooting of fishermen by the Taiwan coast guard over the weekend, to avoid similar incidents in the future.
A fishing boat from Guangdong province was seized on Saturday morning by a Taiwan patrol boat in waters near Penghu county in southeastern Taiwan.
Two of its seven crew members were injured by rubber bullets fired from the patrol boat, Taiwan authorities said. They were sent to a hospital in Penghu for medical treatment, while the other five were detained.
An Fengshan, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, called on the Taiwan side late on Saturday to respect the fact that fishermen from both sides of the Taiwan Straits have long been fishing in the area.
"Similar cases in which Taiwan has seized a mainland fishing boat have occurred frequently in recent times," An said. "We have highlighted respect for the rights of mainland fishermen several times, but another incident occurred on Saturday morning."
Taiwan should stop seizing fishing boats without sound reason for doing so, he said.
"We requested the Taiwan side take the case seriously, release the fishermen and the boat as soon as possible and prevent the recurrence of similar cases in the future."
In March, another spokesman from the office, Ma Xiaoguang, commented on reports that Taiwan authorities had detained 20 mainland fishermen and their boat on charges of illegally trespassing in waters around the Dongsha Islands.
At that time, the office said: "Taiwan should respect fishermen from both sides of the Straits, including those from Hong Kong and Macao, stop its improper treatment of fishermen and protect their lives and property."
Ma voiced opposition to acts that undermine the basis of cross-Straits talks and hinder the development of cross-Straits ties.
The mainland has offered travel conveniences to Taiwan residents for several years.
At the end of 2016, the Civil Aviation Administration of China started upgrading self-service systems at mainland airports, in a move to make buying tickets and checking-in easier for Taiwan travelers.
More than 1,700 self-service facilities are planned across the country by the end of this year, the administration said.

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.
 
A total of up to 20 billion yuan could be paid at the provincial level as bonuses
Beijing will offer rewards to nine provinces that exceeded their capacity cut targets in 2016, financed by a portion of the 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) subsidy allotted to help address overcapacity, Xu Hongcai, assistant finance minister, said on Friday.
Rewards for good performance will facilitate overall progress in cutting overcapacity this year, but less-developed areas that face greater difficulties with economic restructuring also need more financial help, experts said.
Local governments and enterprises in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will receive money for going beyond capacity cut targets in the steel sector. Chongqing, and Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces will receive grants for cuts in the coal sector, Xu said.
"The final amount given to each province will be revealed after the central government verifies the performance of each province last year," Xu said. "We will make sure that the allocation of money is transparent."
The total amount of the rewards would amount to a maximum of 20 percent of 100 billion yuan in special funds established in 2016, Xu said. The remaining 80 percent would be allotted to all regions to help with capacity cuts, he said.
Xu did not provide details on when the amounts will be announced or how the money will be spent.
"The central government's financial support is vital in helping the province achieve the capacity cut target because relocating workers and business restructuring are very costly," said Ji Jinghang, curator of Hangzhou Low-Carbon Museum in Zhejiang province.
Zhejiang's developed and balanced economy allows its laid-off workers to find jobs more easily than those in less-developed places such as in the economically lagging northeastern region.
Zhejiang ranked 14th nationwide in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017, with an 8 percent year-on-year growth rate, while Jilin province, saddled with heavy capacity cut targets, registered 2.4 percent growth during the same quarter.
Zhejiang plans to cut 2 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2020, while the target set for the steel sector this year alone in Jilin is 800,000 tons, according to provincial government documents.
Cheng Gong, a senior China National Coal Association analyst, said economically lagging regions need more financial support from the central government than last year because local governments face higher pressure to achieve targets.




Workers package vegetables at San'an Sino-Science's Photobiology Industry Institute in Anxi county, Fujian province, in April. Zhang Zhihao / China Daily
Vegetables can be grown year-round indoors, in "plant factories" that look a lot like laboratories - without a farm's heavy dependence on water supplies, soil, weather and manual labor.
But plant factories require lots of energy, something that has to change before they can become commonplace, scientists say.
Plant factories do not rely on sunshine. Rather, vegetables are grown in special hydroponic nutrient solutions. All conditions are carefully controlled, and that draws energy.
A plant factory in Anxi county, Fujian province, for example, uses about 10 kilowatts of electricity to produce 1 kilogram of vegetables, according to Li Shaohua, director of San'an Sino-Science's Photobiology Industry Institute. That's about what it takes to power a refrigerator for 20 days, or a plasma TV for 30 hours.
The factory can produce 1.5 metric tons of vegetables a day with 15,000 kilowatts of electrical power.
According to the National Energy Administration, it takes about 315 grams of coal to make 1 kW of electricity, meaning the Anxi growers would need the equivalent of about 4.7 tons of coal a day.
"Almost all of the energy is used to maintain growing conditions, which involves lighting, ventilation and monitoring," Li said. "While the plant factory can greatly reduce environmental pollution caused by fertilizers and pesticides, it is very energy intensive; therefore its carbon footprint is too high."
To tackle this issue, scientists are using solar panels to supply electricity to the factory. They're using energy-efficient LEDs as a light source and aerodynamic interior designs to cut ventilation costs, Li said.
Even so, the overall cost of production at a plant factory is high - and the costs are passed along to buyers, which puts off some potential customers. It costs at least 40 yuan ($5.80) for 1 kg of cabbage from a plant factory. It's about 1 yuan at a farmers' market.
Yet some seem willing to pay. The Anxi company is supplying directly to 130 high-end grocery stores and upscale restaurants in Fujian.
"The province is relatively rich, with a booming middle class, so the demand for fresh and safe food is high," said Lin Xiucheng, founder of San'an Sino-Science. "Our produce is actually in short supply because people are eating more vegetables as they become more health conscious."
But sales of vegetables alone is not enough to cover the costs, so the research team is working on growing rare Chinese medicine, culinary herbs and other plants that have high market value, Lin said.
Not all vegetables are suitable for growth in a plant factory. Cash crops like corn and potatoes require more space than is available in an enclosed environment, and they are not profitable when produced in small volume.
Specialized plants are unknown quantities. Scientists have grown jewel orchids and dendrobium in a lab, for example, but rare herbs that have complex growing conditions, such as Chinese caterpillar fungus, have yet to be grown indoors.
 
The United States is Chinese tourists' top destination for road trips overseas. PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY
Chinese are increasingly preferring road trips overseas as the preferred way to travel and soak in sights and cultures. The United States remains their top destination with Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco being particularly popular.
The US is followed by New Zealand, Germany, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, in terms of popularity, according to a recent report Tuniu Corp, an online travel agency based in Nanjing.
Besides, the United Arab of Emirates, Belgium and France are growing in popularity as Chinese driving licenses are valid there.
The top five cities where self-driving outbound Chinese tourists come from are Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing. These cities have more than two million car owners, making them more likely to travel in their own vehicles in China and in rented cars abroad.
Currently, there are more than 360 million car drivers in China, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
"The growth of holidays marked by car drives is frequently associated with wealth, freedom, and choice, and a growing middle-class in China," said Alex Yan, COO of Tuniu Corp.
"Meanwhile, we found that Chinese road trippers prefer to stay at nicer hotels, but not motels near the roads. More than 80 percent of the them usually stay at four-star or five-star hotels."
The majority of tourists who prefer self-driving trips are aged between 21 and 40, with those aged between 31 and 40 dominating this group. Most of them are affluent and tend to pursue unique trip experiences. Besides, many of them have young children and road trips fulfil their demand for travel with kids.
Lily Min, 26, an office worker in Beijing, said she and her boyfriend last year traveled to Hawaii, where they rented a red convertible.
"Hawaii is large and it's inconvenient to travel around if you don't rent a car or travel with a group. It feels really cool to drive by ourselves, as we have greater control over our time. And it's not expensive to rent a car－it costs less than $100 per day," she said.
Overseas road trips tend to take longer than an average trip. About half of these trips last year lasted 11 to15 days.
Domestic road trips are also proving to be popular. Among the well-received weekend getaways are Zhuhai and Guangzhou in Guangdong province, and Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
Longer domestic road trips to Tibet, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are also popular among Chinese tourists. About half of the domestic road trips last six to 10 days.

New York Port Authority says China companies welcome to bid
NEW YORK － US President Donald Trump has pledged a massive infrastructure plan in the country, which may bring increasing opportunities for Chinese companies, US experts said recently.
"The Trump administration has been very focused on investing in infrastructure, including public-private partnerships ... we are open for business and welcome Chinese companies to participate and bid for the projects," said Patrick Foye, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, during a business seminar in New York on infrastructure development and investment.
Foye further explained that as the government agency oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure in the two states, the Port Authority processes bridges, tunnels, airports and seaports, which are revenue-generating assets.
He added it expected to "attract capital from all over the world, including China."
Foye's views were echoed by Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on US-China Relations, who also spoke at the event.
"When I looked at the one trillion dollar price tag that President Trump has put on the infrastructure needs of the United States ... I looked at the three trillion dollars in reserves in China, I looked at the expertise that exists in China and I looked at what China Construction America and other Chinese construction companies are doing, creating jobs in the United States," said Orlins.
China Construction America Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd, is among the Chinese companies that have been playing an active role in the US construction market.
Founded in 1985, CCA now has 2,000 employees, of whom 98 percent are local employees, according to company President Ning Yuan, who also attended the event.
Yuan said his group had successfully completed six bridge projects in the New York Metropolitan area and ranked number ten in bridge contractors across the United States.
CCA is fully funded and ready to get involved in more public-private partnership projects, he noted.
Foye pointed out that Chinese companies like CCA should focus not only on capital-raising but also on engineering solutions and creativity when bidding on a project.
"Continued growth and success of the Chinese firms in the US will eventually give them a competitive advantage in the public-private partnership market," said Foye.
PARIS - The French electoral commission, which supervises the country's presidential race, on Saturday warned local media not to republish data and information hacked from centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign staff.
In a statement, the commission asked media not to report the content of the leaked documents on their websites, stressing that publishing false information would be punished under criminal law.
Late on Friday, Macron's campaign team said it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
The leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, it added.
However, the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation," according to Macron's En Marche! (On the Move!) party.
The alleged hacking of the leading political party in the presidential race came on the eve of the election's run-off on Sunday.
Pollsters predict Macron to beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen with large margin.
In February, Macron's staff said their campaign had been the target of cyber attacks targeting databases and e-mail servers.
PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Saturday that the latest US-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint military drills were "unprecedentedly hideous and most adventurous ones" in several decades.
In a military commentary, the official Korean Central News Agency said the US and ROK have made it public that all their joint military drills aimed to "remove the leadership" of the DPRK and "bring down its system."
These exercises had "thrown away their deceptive veils as annual drills and defensive ones," it said.
"The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills revealed that the new Trump administration, too, is resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK by use of force, tougher sanctions and pressure," it said.
The US and ROK have just concluded two-month-long joint military drills involving 300,000 troops.
The US has also sent its aircraft carrier task group USS Carl Vinson and a nuclear submarine to waters off the Korean peninsula, besides carrying out nuclear bomb dropping drills in ROK and test launching two intercontinental ballistic missile within one week from California to the Western Pacific over the past two weeks.

PARIS - Polling stations opened on France's European mainland on Sunday for the decisive round of a presidential election crucial for both the country and the European Union (EU).
Nearly 47 million voters are expected to cast their ballots, choosing between pro-Europe, pro-business centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, and anti-immigration, anti-EU far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
More than 66,000 polling stations on the French European mainland opened at 08:00 local time (0600 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 20:00 in big cities, while the rest will close at 19:00.
French voters in overseas territories casted their votes on Saturday, but the results will be only known after all votes are casted on the mainland.
Official campaigning period ended Friday night, signalling the start of a blackout on any campaigning activities, according to French electoral law.
The law bans the publication of any early poll or counting results of the vote before all polling stations are closed.
Preliminary projections of the voting results are expected to be revealed by various sources after 20:00.
Macron and Le Pen topped the first round vote of the election on April 23, with 24.01 percent and 21.30 percent of votes, respectively.
Several major French opinion polls conducted after the first round have been consistent, which estimate that former economy minister Macron is likely to win the runoff after an intense campaign against Le Pen.
The two candidates both casted their votes on Sunday morning.
Macron, accompanied by his wife Brigitte, casted his vote around 11:00 local time in Le Touquet, north France.
Le Pen voted in Henin-Beaumont, north France, around 11:05.
The two contenders proposed very different prospects for France throughout an intense campaign.
Dubbed himself as "the candidate for jobs," Macon invited electorate from various political views to endorse his pro-business projects and plans to revive the European project.
His rival Le Pen, proposing a strict opposite program based on protectionist approaches, promised voters a return to the national currency and tightening internal borders to restore security.
Outgoing French president Francois Hollande and prime minister Bernard Cazenveuve both voted around 10:25 (0825GMT).
Hollande publicly endorsed Macron, who had served in his government as economy minister, calling on voters to support Macron and to reject the rise of the far-right.
The turnout at 12:00 (1000 GMT) in the ongoing runoff of the French presidential election on Sunday was 28.23 percent, lower than the figure in 2012, French interior ministry announced. In 2012, the turnout for the runoff at the same hour was registered at 30.66 percent. In the first around of the election on April 23, the turnout at noon was 28.54 percent.
The French interior ministry has vowed to to carry out tight security measure to safeguard the election, with over 50,000 police and gendarmes deployed across the country.
On Sunday afternoon, the courtyard outside the Louvre Museum, where Macron plans to celebrate if he wins the election, was temporary evacuated for "precautionary measures," the Paris police department said.
C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily]
The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry.
With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft.
Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls.
Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft.
All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials.
These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919.
Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei."
Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane.
"The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said.
"Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said.
By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast.
Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035.
After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years.
So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

China's foreign trade is expected to sustain an upward trend in the near future, as more export-oriented companies focus on developing new levels of competitiveness, according to the spokesman of the nation's biggest trade event.
"Chinese exporters are no longer manufacturers focusing on intensive production and lower pricing to compete in the global market," said Xu Bing, spokesman of the Canton Fair.
The Canton Fair－held twice a year and known as the China Import and Export Fair－concluded on Friday in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou with reported total transactions at the spring fair increasing by 6.9 percent year-on-year to 206.357 billion yuan ($30 billion).
"Development of new competitiveness－including technology, brands, quality and services－is reasons behind the increased transactions for Chinese exporters," said Xu, also deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
There were 196,490 overseas buyers from 213 countries and regions visiting the fair, a rise of 5.87 percent year-on-year.
"We can see that more companies participating in the Canton Fair displayed products with higher quality and design, which offer high added values and are more competitive in the global market," Xu added.
The spokesman said more companies were attaching importance to innovation and building overseas branding and sales centers.
Transactions at the brand exhibition areas during the fair increased by 16.9 percent year-on-year to $10.9 billion, accounting for 36.3 percent of the total.
Su Cheng, general manager of Taizhou Chenghao Machine Mould Co Ltd, said Chinese homegrown moulds, which are of high quality with competitive prices, had also been sold to developed markets.
"The demand for Chinese moulds has been increasing recently in developed markets, which are traditionally powerhouses for high-quality industrial moulds," said Su.
According to Su, the company's moulds have been sold in major markets like the United States, Japan and Russia.
"The demand from developed markets began steadily increasing from the second half of last year. We are making efforts to developing high-quality moulds to satisfy the demand," said Su.
The Zhejiang-based company, which is mainly engaged in production and sale of moulds for industrial air conditioners, also develops garden pots which can automatically water flowers.
UR Work's a booth at the China(Beijing) International "Internet+" Era Exposition held last August. A QING / FOR CHINA DAILY
Two major Chinese co-working space companies, UR Work and New Space, announced they were merging on April 26, to form a group with a market valuation of around 9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion).
The combined entity is projected to provide 100,000 desks with an area of more than 500,000 square meters for innovation-driven companies in 35 cities worldwide over the next three years.
"China has entered an era with a big supply of real estate," said Wang Shengjiang, founder and CEO of New Space.
"Co-working spaces have a huge potential to revitalize the market, since office space is still in high demand."
Wang said the resources of the two groups would be integrated to provide better services for customers.
UR Work, a two-year-old start-up, became China's leading co-working space company with a market valuation of around 7 billion yuan ($1.17 billion) after completing a round of financing in January.
The company now has about 40,000 members and 2,000 companies working in its spaces in 20 cities around the world, according to UR Work founder Mao Daqing.
Mao is chairman of the combined group and Wang is one of the co-CEOs. Wang's group remains an independent operation.
The merger follows in the wake of other companies in the sector which are expected to restructure.
In early 2017, Wujie Space acquired another joint office company, Fourwork. WE+ and Cowork also announced in March they were combining.
"The following year will see an integration of the whole co-working space industry," said Wan Liushuo, CEO of Beijing-based co-working space enterprise Wujie Space, announcing his company's financing at a news conference in March.
In 2015, there were only about 10 co-working space enterprises in China. Now the number has surpassed 4,000, he said.
"Competition has become fierce," Wan said.
"Spaces in rural areas or purely relying on government business will be closed soon," Wan said.
He said that being closed down or bought were the two most likely choices for some small companies, he said.
Although China only had a few co-working spaces in 2015, the past two years have seen a rising demand for flexible workspace in developed cities across China.
Co-working spaces are expected to make up 30 percent of the office market in China by 2030 with an annual growth rate of 30 percent, according to a report released by the US-based real estate services provider Colliers International Group Inc in March.
However how profitable the new sector remains open to question.
Co-working spaces make their profits mainly through rent, according to a co-working space blue paper released by Wujie Space in 2016.
Yin Yu, an executive manager of Wujie Space, said occupancy rates needed to exceed 50 percent to break even.
Wujie now owns 13 spaces in Beijing and Tianjin with a total area of 30,000 square meters. More than 80 percent of desks were rented by stores over the past four months, she said.
The monthly rent of Wujie Space is 1,600 to 2,200 yuan per desk. Services, including printing, gym, showering and games room are charged at low rates or are free, according to the blue paper.
SOHO 3Q, another co-working space company, initially set a relatively high monthly rent of 4,000 yuan ($580) per desk. It then gave a 30 to 55 percent discounts to attract customers.
Chairman of SOHO 3Q, Pan Shiyi, said the initial rent rates caused a loss.
The CEO of UR Work, Mao Daqing, said the contribution of rental incomes to the company's total profits were expected to drop from 90 percent to 60 percent in 2017.
"Co-working spaces shouldn't rely completely on rent," Mao said.
"Services spring from the sharing space are the major source of profit."
More than 250 companies settled in UR Work spaces, including financial and legal consultancies, recruitment, market promotion and equipment maintenance, groups according to the official website of UR Work.
The company said it will focus on globalization, development of intelligent offices and construction of entrepreneur towns in the future, Mao said.
It signed an agreement in April with Ali Cloud－a cloud computing service provider unit of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group－in a move to boost its international strategy.
The company also cooperated with Chinese bike-sharing company, ofo, whose bike stations will be constructed near UR Work co-working spaces worldwide.

China's first domestically produced passenger plane completed a high-speed taxi test for the first time in Shanghai on Sunday, just one step away from its maiden flight, thepaper.cn reported.
The COMAC C919 rolled off the assembly line on Nov 2, 2015, and was delivered to the flight test center in December.
The Shanghai-based State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd, its manufacturer, has completed most of ground-based pre-flight evaluations, including the low-speed and medium-speed taxi test, to examine the whole aircraft and its key components and connecting parts.
It will conduct more high-speed taxiing tests at a speed of up to 170 kilometers per hour before its first flight scheduled in the first half of this year.
With more than 150 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, the locally designed and built aircraft marks a significant milestone in Chinese manufacturing, as China moves up the global production chain.
The plane is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing Co's new-generation 737, which currently dominate the market.
By the end of 2016, a total of 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000.

China plans to build a Giant Panda National Park spanning three provinces to help the endangered animals mingle and enrich their gene pool.
Pandas isolated on six mountains in the provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi and Sichuan will be able to come together in the proposed park, which will cover 27,134 square kilometers, three times the area of Yellowstone National Park in the United States.
It will have a core area, protecting pandas in 67 existing reserves as well as another 8,000 endangered animals and plants.
Like many endangered species, pandas are suffering loss and fragmentation of their habitat as a result of natural disasters, climate change and expanding human activity.
The problem is exacerbated by the multiple administrations controlling the three provinces, because jurisdiction becomes blurred when pandas cross provincial boundaries.
The park will solve the problem. When it is complete, the pandas will be able to roam freely between their far-flung habitats. It will also lead to the relocation of a lot of people - for example, at least 170,000 people in Sichuan will have to relocate to establish the core protection area.
"Unlike nature reserves, the park will not stand alone. China will formulate an overall plan for the national park system. It will be a haven of biodiversity and will provide protection for the whole ecological system," said Hou Rong, director of the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan.
According to the plan, China's national park system will comprise the Giant Panda National Park and eight other facilities devoted to endangered species and the headwaters of major rivers. Last year, the central government endorsed reform plans to "advance ecological progress", which included the plan to establish national parks.
Hou said the park will offer residents new homes and jobs. Many could be employed as tourist guides and as construction workers on infrastructure projects, so people and nature will benefit together.
People have lived in panda reserves for generations, but they cut bamboo shoots and grazed their livestock on hills, eating into the pandas' habitat and disrupting their lives.
Qubie Mazi, a member of the Yi ethnic group, has lived in Sichuan's Hei Hezi village for 40 years, making a living by growing potatoes and collecting herbs. A panda reserve in the village is a key corridor connecting populations on nearby Liangshan Mountain.
Poverty once drove the villagers to poach pandas, but after a penalty-and-bonus system was introduced, they learned to value the national treasures and now cherish them.
"I saw a panda in one of the village houses a month ago. I guess he came to look for food or company. I know that when they need to mate, they go to the other side of the mountain. When I discover something unusual about the pandas, I report it to the reserve," Qubie said.
Asked how he feels about making way for pandas, he said, "I will move, providing I can have a new home and a new job."
According to Heng Yi, a senior member of staff at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, higher living standards would benefit both the local population and the pandas.
The "foreigner's permanent residence card," known as the Chinese "green card," will be renamed the "foreigner's permanent residence identity card," according to the plan.
Like the identity cards used by Chinese citizens, foreigners' identity information will be embedded in the chips of the machine-readable cards, which will be shared by railway and airline departments, hotels and banks.
Approved by the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform, the reform plan serves the nation's talent development strategy and responds to social concerns.
The reform also aims to provide foreigners easier access to public services in China, and the work is expected to be finished before June.
In 2016, 1,576 foreigners became permanent Chinese residents, an increase of 163 percent over the previous year, according to the MPS.
China has made huge progress in easing its residence and entry policies for foreigners since September 2015, which has helped attract more talent from overseas and boosted international exchanges.

Shanghai has ranked as the "most attractive" city for foreign residents for the fifth consecutive year due to its international atmosphere and multicultural environment, according to an annual survey.
Beijing, the nation's capital, remained second, thanks to its advantages in healthcare and educational resources, while Hangzhou, the so-called "Heaven on Earth" in Zhejiang province, held onto third place.
The rankings, released Saturday, were based on a survey of about 25,000 expatriates nationwide in December and January. The criteria ranged from the living environment and local culture to administrative services and favorable policies for foreign residents.
The China Society for Research on International Professional Personnel Exchange and Development launched the annual survey in partnership with the International Talent magazine in 2010 as a way to promote the nation's cities.
One of the biggest changes in the top 10 was for Qingdao, a coastal city in Shandong province, which moved up two places to fourth, replacing Shenzhen, the southern metropolis, which slipped to sixth.
Qingdao scored much higher than Shanghai and Beijing in terms of air pollution and traffic congestion, as did Suzhou, a picturesque city in Jiangsu province, which placed seventh.
This year's survey also showed China's rapid economic growth and its future development potential are major draws for foreigners with a long-term plans to work or live in the country.
More than half of all respondents said the environment was the most important factor when considering staying long term, while preferential policies also were a major concern.
Loic Bastard, a Frenchman who works for Envision Energy and has been based in Wuxi, another city in Jiangsu, for two years, said he enjoys living in his "clean" and "beautiful" adopted home.
"With easy transportation, good infrastructure and a good environment, smaller cities have gained more competitiveness compared with metropolises," he said. "With an increasing number of preferential policies from the local government, I think second- and third-tier cities will be attractive to more foreign expats."

Editor's note:
President Xi Jinping proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road initiative aims to create a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along ancient trade routes.
Since then, more than 100 countries and international organizations have backed the initiative, with more than 40 signing cooperation agreements with China.
In May, China will host a Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing. Let's look back at some of the important comments Xi has made on the initiative in the last three years.
Proposing an 'economic belt along the Silk Road'

To create the new economic belt, Xi suggested China and Central Asian countries accelerate policy communication, improve road connectivity, promote unimpeded trade, enhance monetary circulation and enhance understanding.
Four executives have been ordered to account for their company's poor implementation of pollution control measures, the public security authority in Jinan, Shandong province, said on Monday.
Shandong Lvjie Energy Saving was told to stop production and dismantle its small coal-fired units after a visit on Sunday by an inspection team sent by the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
The team reported that the company's manual coal-fired boilers were not on a list of small coal-fired boilers that need to be eliminated, there was also no equipment to control dust and effluent gas in an electric welding production area, and the production area was responsible for large-scale noise pollution.
According to the public security authority, the head of the company, identified as Wang, refused to provide inspectors with information and instead locked them in a room for over an hour until police arrived. The case is being investigation.

Despite criticism that a sex education textbook is too graphic, parents and professionals have united in its defense. Yang Wanli reports.
"Every time I express my belief that sex education should begin at primary school level, many of my friends are stunned, almost open mouthed. They say 'Oh, my goodness! How can we allow these innocent kids to learn about sex?'" said Li Ming, a sex education teacher at Xingzhi Primary School in the Beijing's Daxing district.
Recently, the school has been targeted as a result of its use of a sex education textbook, even though it was published 10 years ago.
Some critics complain that the book is too graphic because it includes illustrations of genitalia, full penetration and menstruation.
"Many people believe the stereotype that sex education is simply about sexual intercourse," Li said. In fact, the book's 12 volumes - whose collective name translates as Cherishing Life - are intended for students from grades one to six. The books cover six themes, including family and friends, life skills, gender and rights, sexuality and healthy behavior.
Despite widespread support for the book, some parents remain unconvinced.
"Some knowledge of sexual activity and contraceptives is included in the textbook for children at grades five and six. I'm concerned that knowing this sort of information will encourage children to try sex even earlier," Apple, the mother of a 3-year-old girl, wrote on her Weibo account.
A child's right?
Since its launch, the textbook, written by academics at Beijing Normal University, has been used in 18 primary schools in Beijing to teach about 15,000 children ages 6 to 11.
Liu Wenli, the book's lead author, has specialized in child development and sex education since the 1980s.
When she returned to China after studying and working in the United States for 10 years, she was enthusiastic about promoting sex education.
"Unlike some people who view sex education simply as the prevention of unplanned pregnancies, sexual activity at a young age and sexually transmitted diseases, I believe sex education is a child's right. Children have the right to learn and know more about themselves and other people," she said.
"This not only answers fundamental questions, such as 'Where am I from?' but also provides the basis for developing mutual respect with other people and a tolerance of differences."
The heightened public and media discussion about the textbook has resulted in a growing number of parents visiting bookstores to buy it.
Liu recently received a message from the publisher informing her that it is printing extra copies in response to the growing demand.
Three hikers have been killed and two others were frostbitten after they traveled along one of the most dangerous hiking routes in northwest China's Shaanxi province and encountered a terrible snowstorm, a regional rescue team was quoted as saying by West China Metropolis Daily.
At least 50 Chinese backpackers from regions including Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Qinghai and Yunnan were trying to cross from Aoshan Mountain to the peak of Taibai Mountain in Shaanxi's Qinling Mountains during the May Day holiday, according to the Shaanxi Shuguang Emergency Rescue Association.
Hiking in the mountains is becoming increasingly popular in China, but many people have insufficient knowledge about the sport, and its dangers.
"The 120-km hiking trail from Aoshan Mountain to Taibai Mountain takes about seven days to walk along, and it covers depopulated zones," said Chen Xutong, a director at the Shuguang association.
"Because the missing backpackers do not have GPS, it is really difficult to find them," he told China Daily.
Chen said that the association's rescue efforts started at about 9 am on Friday, when the snowstorm abated. The 20-person rescue team from the association was searching around the Paomaliang area where the mercury stood below - 10 C. Two of the three victims died from hypothermia, according to West China Metropolis Daily.
By early Friday afternoon, one hiker from Shanghai and another seven from Changshu, Jiangsu province, had contacted loved ones. Thirteen people from Yiwu, Zhejiang province, and three people from Yunnan province have been confirmed safe.
"The extreme weather and low temperature pose the biggest threat," Chen said. The mercury drops 6 C for every 1,000-meter increase in altitude.
He also said the rescuers were trained with medical knowledge.
Meanwhile, personnel at Taibai county were organizing separate rescue efforts.
According to a news release from the county's publicity department on Friday, the regional public security bureau received four reports on Thursday, claiming eight people went missing during the hike.
More than 50 rescuers from the county, divided into three groups, headed from different areas on Thursday afternoon for the mountains.
All the missing people were successfully reached by 6 pm, according to Huang Ma, who told West China Metropolis Daily that there were about 30 to 40 people in total, including a third one who died and two who suffered frostbite.
Cheng Si in Shanghai and Huo Yan in Xi'an contributed to this story.


The Palace Museum in Beijing, also called the Forbidden City, said on Friday that it will open its first permanent satellite gallery outside Beijing on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, Fujian province, on May 13.

The Kulangsu Gallery of Foreign Artifacts from the Palace Museum Collections will be in a former hospital that was set up by a Dutch-American missionary in 1898.

The opening exhibition features 219 artifacts including antique clocks, scientific instruments and paintings from abroad. They come from the 16th to the early 20th century.

The artifacts were chosen from the Palace Museum's collection of some 10,000 foreign artifacts, many of which were brought by missionaries and diplomats to the court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Because the museum has lacked a space to present the items, most of those going on display in Xiamen have long been stored in warehouses.

"The Palace Museum has the responsibility to find a place to show the artifacts to give the public a wider view of the world's civilization," said Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. "Due to historical reasons, in Western museums, we can see many items from abroad, but such institutions are quite rare in China."

Gulangyu Island, a top tourist spot once called Kulangsu, hosted the settlements of 13 countries from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, making the 1.88-square-kilometer island a cultural melting pot.

"The island is a center of historical architecture from many countries," Shan said. "Its atmosphere echoes our exhibits from overseas, and is thus a perfect place to display them."

Gulangyu's bid to become a World Heritage Site will be taken up at a UNESCO conference in Poland in July. Ni Chao, a standing member of the Xiamen committee of the Communist Party of China, said the new, 5,168-square-meter museum will be a bonus for the island's cultural landscape.





Forty-five people were convicted on Friday by three courts in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, for their involvement in a deadly landslide that killed 73 people.

Four people also remain missing after the landslide at a construction waste disposal site in Shenzhen's Guangming new district on Dec 20, 2015.

The accident destroyed 33 buildings and caused direct economic losses of 880 million yuan ($127.5 million), the courts found.

Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court, Nanshan District People's Court and Baoan District People's Court found that the tragedy was a result of irregular subcontracting, loose management, corruption as well as dereliction of duty.

Twenty-six executives and employees from Shenzhen Lyuwei Properties Management and Shenzhen Yixianglong Investment and Development were convicted of causing a serious accident and giving bribes to government officials.

Long Renfu, chairman of Yixianglong, was sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined 10 million yuan.

The other 19 were local government workers. They were charged with abuse of authority, taking bribes or dereliction of duty.

Meng Jinghang, former director of the Shenzhen Urban Management Bureau, was sentenced for 20 years and fined 8 million yuan for taking bribes and abusing his powers.



Liu Jianchao, a former Foreign Ministry spokesman and senior official in charge of hunting China's corrupt fugitives, has been appointed discipline chief of Zhejiang province.
He became head of the province's commission for discipline inspection and a member of the province's core leadership - the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Zhejiang Committee - in late April, according to an official report posted on Thursday on Zhejiang Online.
Ren Zemin will leave his post as commission chief, the report said, without disclosing details. Ren, 63, has surpassed the routine retirement age of vice-ministerial officials in China.
Liu, 53, will take charge of investigating graft issues involving Party and government officials in the province, and also supervise them to ensure compliance with Party rules to build a clean government, according to the Zhejiang Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection website.
Liu joined the Foreign Ministry in 1987 and acquired extensive experience at the information department. He became assistant minister of foreign affairs in 2013.
In 2015, Liu was appointed deputy director of the National Bureau of Corruption Prevention, a vice-ministerial-level post. He also became head of the International Cooperation Department of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, the country's top anti-graft watchdog.
The commission is the Party's anti-corruption agency, while the bureau is a government department. A commission deputy director will usually also be head of the bureau, and some other officials from the two agencies also will overlap.
The appointment took many people by surprise because it opened a new career path for senior diplomats. It was widely believed that Liu's long diplomatic experience would be used to help China better communicate with other countries during the hunt for corrupt fugitives abroad.
In late 2012, China launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign after the new leadership was elected. To capture economic fugitives who had fled abroad, China set up the Central Anti-Corruption Coordination Group, led by the CCDI, and launched Sky Net, an operation targeting corrupt fugitives.
In April 2015, Interpol issued red notices - requests to locate and detain an individual pending repatriation - for the 100 most-wanted Chinese corrupt former officials. Forty have been returned to date from more than 16 countries and regions, according to the CCDI.
"Liu is very professional and an innovative official. He's especially good at advancing new ideas and taking effective measures to improve work efficiency," said an anti-graft officer who worked closely with Liu at the CCDI but declined to be named.
Alec Su's latest film, The Devotion of Suspect X, knocked Hollywood behemoth Kong: Skull Island off the top slot in China's box-office charts on its first day. Xu Fan reports.
During the recent Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday break, a profitable time for China's movie market, Alec Su worked nonstop. The actor and singer-turned-director traveled more than 21,700 kilometers from March 22 to April 3, touring 15 cities to promote his second directorial feature, The Devotion of Suspect X.
Su, once a heartthrob on the Chinese screen, says he was "anxious" with his career shift.
But his latest film, based on Japanese author Keigo Higashino's award-winning novel of the same title, knocked Hollywood behemoth Kong: Skull Island off the top slot in China's box-office charts on its first day on March 31, according to live tracker Cbooo.cn.
The 112-minute movie, which is seen by some industry watchers as a bid by Chinese-language movies to enter overseas markets, opened in North America, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom simultaneously on Friday, and will be released in Singapore on April 13.
Meanwhile, negotiations are on in other markets, according to Beijing-based studio Enlight Pictures, one of the key investors.
But for Su, the film means more than just box-office returns.

Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Maria Callas and Amy Winehouse all made the cat eye part of their signature look. From street style to the runway, there's no such thing as mere eyeliner when it comes to seducing at first sight.
Kim Bourhila, a Paris-based make-up artist for Shu Uemura, raises the eyeliner level to the art of calligraphy. "I love to do cat-eye make-up because it dramatically transforms one's eye expression," he says. "Eyeliner is something you can endlessly play with to create all kinds of looks: natural, dramatic, graphic, artistic… Once you master it, the sky's the limit."
"It's true that applying eyeliner can be challenging at the beginning, but mastery comes with practice," says Bourhila. "No need to sit for hours on the make-up chair to get a lovely cat eye." He adds, with a knowing smile: "And don't aim for perfect symmetrical lines, or you may go crazy and run the risk of ruining everything."
Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned expert, you can be sure that there's a perfect liner waiting for you. Here are some of Bourhila's professional tricks for a flawless line.
• For a longer-lasting cat eye, start by dusting on some powder (light eyeshadow or translucent face powder) on your eyelid.
• Sit at a large mirror and don't close your eyes when you draw your lines.
• Step back from time to time to see the whole picture and adjust accordingly.
• Keep calm and don't rush: start with thin lines and accentuate progressively.
• Note that two or three strokes are often necessary to get the right result.
• First draw the lash line and define the wing, then refine the top line to get an even overall shape.
• Last but not least, keep a cotton swab close to hand and use it like an eraser to correct your lines if necessary.
Katie Chin's cookbook features recipes that she and her mother developed together. Photos provided to China Daily
A new cookbook celebrates a family's life around Chinese food, from Guangzhou to Minneapolis, Mike Peters reports.
Leeann Chin knew it would be hard for her children to assimilate as Chinese-Americans growing up in the northern US state of Minnesota.
"My mother did everything she could to help us fit in, like bringing us to Sons of Norway events, but every night she made us Chinese food," her daughter Katie Chin writes in her new book. "We didn't fully appreciate the gourmet Chinese meals we were served, and secretly wished we were eating Hamburger Helper like all the other kids. Foolish, I know."
Her mom's lifelong love of cooking wasn't confined to her home kitchen. The Leeann Chin restaurant chain she founded now has 45 locations spread across the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul. After she retired, she wrote a Chinese cookbook with Katie, and the two started a pan-Asian catering business called Double Happiness Catering.
Leeann died in 2010, but her daughter has captured their culinary life together in Katie Chin's Everyday Chinese Cookbook: 101 Delicious Recipes From My Mother's Kitchen.
"In between our catering gigs, we were lucky enough to travel to China together to co-host a Food Network special called My Country, My Kitchen," Katie Chin writes, "as well as to New York for numerous appearances together on the Today show. The next natural step was to do a cooking show: We co-hosted the national PBS cooking series Double Happiness, a mother-daughter Chinese cooking show shot in Hawaii.

The novel is about the bitter-sweet romance between a fox princess and a dragon prince.
The TV series, which was broadcast earlier this year, topped the ratings on TV channels across the country, and saw a record 31 billion online views on five video-streaming sites, including v.qq.com and iqiyi.com.
On Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, the TV drama was discussed in more than 10.3 billion posts.
The TV series saw mainland actress Yang Mi and Taiwan actor Mark Chao, respectively, as the fox and the dragon, but their roles will be played by actress Liu Yifei and Yang Yang in the movie.
Financed by Alibaba Pictures, the film division of internet giant Alibaba, the movie has up to 2,345 special-effect scenes. The scenes took 50 visual effects animators 15 months of work.
Liu, hailed by fans as a screen "goddess", showcased some of her dialogues with Yang at a Beijing event on Thursday.
The movie will open across the Chinese mainland on July 21.

Miniature die-cast Matchbox vehicles were one of the most iconic toys for those born between the 1960s and 1990s.
Made by British manufacturing company Lesney Products, more than 3 billion toy vehicles have been sold by Matchbox across 12,000 model lines since the company's inception in the late 1940s, according to The Telegraph.
While the primary target audience of such toys are children, the brand does have its fair share of adult collectors in China.
Shi Ming, 41, the operations director of DHL Aviation Services in Shanghai, is one such avid collector who has a whopping 3,000 Matchbox cars in his collection. He can even name every car model that is on display in his home.
"It was so fascinating when my mom gave me my first Matchbox car during my elementary school year in 1986. It was very cheap, only 1.6 yuan ($0.25), but it was nevertheless very unique at the time," said Shi.
How has contemporary Chinese art been evolving over the past decade? The answer will be found at a contemporary ink exhibition that opens on June 1, at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.
The week-long exhibition will show some 300 paintings of 98 Chinese artists who explore the diversity ink traditions in a modern context.
The exhibition is organized by the Nanjing-based Bajia Lake International Culture Investment Group. It will be part of a series of celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
He Guiyan, the exhibition curator, says Hong Kong played a significant role in introducing contemporary Chinese art and artists to the world in the early 1990s, and remains a dominant player in the global art market today.
He says the exhibition will present how artists today respond to globalization and show a much more diverse picture of contemporary Chinese art.

Children today are getting further and further away from nature. With the ever-increasing use of electronic devices, they are distancing themselves from spending time outside and keeping their heads down, eyes glued to small shiny screens.
Mother Nature provides one of the best venues for kids to play and learn. With the three-day spring holiday just around the corner, why not take the opportunity to take children outside, get closer to nature, spend some quality family time and take part in activities that are both fun and educational?
Here are some recommendations.
Try out some traditional toys
Kite [Photo provided to China Daily Asia]
Despite the digital revolution, traditional toys have proved to be everlasting entertainment for kids across the generations. These toys have always been connected with traditional culture, so take this opportunity to share the stories behind the toys with the kids.
For instance, the Han Dynasty-invented lanterns is a symbol of the family's prosperity and festivity. Shadow puppetry was invented when Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty summoned his officers to bring his beloved concubine back. Did you know the humble kite was initially used as a tool for military communication? And rattle drums first appeared as musical instruments in the Warring States Period? While, the ever popular shuttlecock was invented more than 2,000 years ago.
Heritage is never boring.

A 15th-century blue-and-white bowl that fetched HK$229 million ($29.5 million) at Sotheby's auction on Wednesday will appear at an upcoming exhibition in Shanghai.
According to the Shanghai billionaire and collector Liu Yiqian, the bowl will be on loan from its current Asian owner for display at the Long Museum, which was founded by Liu and his wife, Wang Wei, and it will be shown as part of an exhibition dedicated to the artworks of the Yongle and Xuande periods of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), scheduled to open on April 28.
Standing 23 centimeters high, the bowl exemplifies the magnificence of porcelain making that reached climax during the Ming era, especially the Xuande period the bowl dates from.
It had been kept in a private Japanese collection for some 50 years before it appeared in Sotheby's salesroom.

During a research trip to South Africa last summer, Zhang Chi visited several deprived areas to learn about the conditions facing the people who live in them. The first slum she visited was on the western outskirts of Cape Town, where the residents had built temporary shelters from sheets of iron and strips of linen on plots of deserted land.

Thanks to frequent media reports, the dusty roads and congested settlements were nothing new to the 22-year-old senior at Yale University, who is majoring in architecture. Instead, Zhang was interested in discovering what lay behind the tumbledown walls.

As she walked behind the shabby walls, she realized that they enclosed tiny courtyards. Even though they were only a couple of square meters, each courtyard was full of flowers and artfully arranged plants. Some even had wooden tables and benches, giving a feeling of a "South Asian hotel garden".

Zhang was greeted by a woman standing by the road who invited the Chinese student to visit her house.

To Zhang's surprise, the wooden front door had been carefully painted light blue and the tiny garden was full of blooming plants.

"From the outside, the house looked extremely small, but as we walked in, I found it was actually divided into four rooms. The first room was clean and tidy. It was illuminated by a ray of light filtering through a window in the roof and filled with the bright color of the purple bedsheet as well as pink and orange toys propped against the light-blue wooden wall. There were also three photos of relatives hanging on the wall. I was deeply moved by her love of life," Zhang recalled.

"During my interaction with other slum dwellers, I was impressed by their optimism and their ability to build a future for themselves. They should not be regarded as a burden on society - all they need is an opportunity to learn some skills and earn other people's trust."

Lee Joi-tin, is taking a gap year before becoming a senior politics student at the University of Hong Kong. He has chosen to spend the year as a volunteer at the Kakuma Refugee Camp in northwestern Kenya.

As soon as the 21-year-old arrived, he began to introduce himself to the residents. "I'm from Hong Kong," he told them. To his surprise, this perfectly normal introduction was greeted with looks of disbelief.

"The refugees asked me to clarify what I had said. At first, I wondered why, but then I realized an area of the camp is also called Hong Kong," he said.

The refugees began watching martial arts movies from Hong Kong more than 20 years ago, according to Lee, and their passion for the movies was clearly demonstrated by the unofficial name of the area.

"After they realized the differences between the two 'Hong Kongs', they repeatedly told me how much they loved Hong Kong movies. They even asked if I had met Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee," he said.

"My colleagues and friends are curious about the One Country, Two Systems concept, and they often ask me why my mother tongue is Cantonese instead of Mandarin."

It is still rare for Chinese to work in the camp, where the residents are more familiar with the presence of Western volunteers.

So far, Lee has spent more than six months at the camp, working with the residents to improve educational programs established by a local NGO called Solidarity and Advocacy in Crisis.

"I have been in the camp for so long that even some of my American friends have been called 'Chinese' by the kids," he said, with a laugh.

What happens when you blend two popular dishes from the East and West? Baozza!
Food has proven to be a popular – and delicious – way of bridging cultures. And one dish is trying to do just that.
It combines two wildly popular dishes in China and the United States.
But when it comes to diplomacy, there can be different kinds of approaches: high-level talks between leaders and people-to-people exchanges.
“We were talking about the idea of maybe combining bao with more traditional American flavors like burger and different things and somebody said pizza baozi and I quipped, I just said as a joke, I said ‘bao-zza!’ and the more I thought about it the more I thought there might be something to this,” said Cree.
And there, “Baozza” was born.
Cree was so convinced that he quit his job and moved to China.

Tudou, a name almost marginalized in China's internet world, announced plans last week to make an eye-catching comeback as a power in the field of online short videos.
According to He Xiaopeng, head of the newly launched platform for short videos (defined as video clips shorter than 25 minutes), about 2 billion yuan ($290 million) will be invested to encourage individual users to provide better original content on Tudou. For example, the high-quality content providers, who own at least five channels and attract 100 million clicks within three months, could be eligible for a bonus of 1 million yuan.
Once China's second-largest online video broadcaster, in 2012 Tudou merged into the industry's leader at that time, Youku.
Nevertheless, the new Tudou.com will probably borrow little but the name from its predecessor: It will focus on short videos for mobile devices and mix content creation with online shopping, backed by internet conglomerate Alibaba. It is designed to interact with China's major online shopping platforms like Taobao.

For the first time in China Fashion Week, "see now, buy now" has become a reality. In collaboration with JD.com, one of the largest business-to-consumer retailers in China, the shows on Wednesday adopted the new model, which allows the customers to buy the garments online at the same time as they are paraded on the runway.
As a sponsor for the event, JD.com presented G-star RAW, a Dutch brand that specializes in jeans, US fashion label Dickies and Chinese designers Pollyanna Keong and Han Dongyang.
G-Star offered a limited edition of jeans for JD.com, in celebration of its 25th anniversary. Dickies showed a collection in collaboration with skateboard brand Thrasher.
Keong, who is best known for her design in the popular TV drama Ode to Joy, showed a collection inspired by futurism and romance. The collection matches feminine skirts with sporty jackets for a chill look.
As a young designer, one of the biggest challenges is to be seen and to be accepted by the market, says Keong.
"This is a very good opportunity for us to be seen and to sell," she says.
A tomb-sweeping dish of mugwort and red bean marks day of homage to ancestors
It's time to sweep some tombs and eat some dumplings.
The Qingming Festival falls on April 4 this year. It is a day for paying homage to ancestors. But frankly, as living, hungry people, we are more excited about the special dumplings.
Qingtuan, or green dumplings, are made of glutinous rice mixed with Chinese mugwort leaves and are usually filled with sweet red bean paste. Zhang Demeng / The World of Chinese
To make this snack, local people mash fresh mugwort leaves and mix them with flour. Then, a sweet filling of red bean is wrapped into the dough. After steaming, the Qingming dumpling becomes soft and delicate, with a mellow taste.
The snack is said to have been invented during the Taiping Rebellion, a massive revolt against the Qing government led by the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace. Around the Qingming Festival, one of the rebel generals of the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace, Li Xiucheng (李秀成), was hidden by a helpful farmer who disguised him as a humble farmhand. When the Qing soldiers couldn't find Li, they surrounded the village and built checkpoints to screen every traveler just in case anyone was sending food to him.
But the farmer came up with an idea: boil mugwort leaves and add them into sticky rice flour to make green rice balls that can be hidden easily in a basket of grass. In the end, Li got his dinner.
INGREDIENTS
100 g glutinous rice flour
30 g wheat starch
50 g mugwort leaves
70 g red beans
70 g sugar
2 tbsp vegetable oil
STEPS
1. Soak the red beans in cold water overnight, then boil them until soft. Grind them to make fine dry paste. If the paste is too moist, stir-fry with a little vegetable oil. Mix with the sugar and set aside.
2. Wash the mugwort leaves and cut them into small pieces; grind the leaves.
3. Add glutinous rice flour to the ground leaves. Knead the mixture thoroughly together with warm water until the dough loses its stickiness; add a spoonful of oil into the dough for color.
4. Divide the dough into blocks of the same size.
5. Stuff each block of dough with the red bean paste, make them into small balls or jiaozi-shaped dumplings if you like.
6. Steam the dumplings for 15 minutes, and serve.

Hairy-crab soup dumpling is a "must-try" dish popular in Gaochun, Jiangsu province. [Photo by Jiang Ghunjing/China Daily]




In spring, Gaochun in Jiangsu province is not only a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle in major cities, but also a seasonal magnet for gourmets.
The hairy crabs from Gucheng Lake, a freshwater lake in Gaochun, are one of the most coveted ingredients. The lake's clear water, abundant insects and grasses provide an ideal environment for the crab to grow. In 1999, Gaochun owned China's first certificate for producing organic crab. The hairy crabs of the lake boast good quality with silky, egg-yolk orange crab roe.
The hairy crab, also known as the Chinese mitten crab, is named for its furry glove-like large pincers. It is customary to eat them with Chinese yellow wine, and dip in a sauce made of rice vinegar and ginger.
Steamed is the simplest and most traditional way to enjoy the crab. Crab eating is quite a delicate operation. With the help of different tools, maybe you can eat crab without cracking the exoskeleton.
Among the many pastries of the area, soft fragrant pastry is one of the most famous. It tastes like peppermint and lotus because peppermint juice is added to the rice flour to make the delicacy and it is served on a food steamer decorated with fresh lotus leaf. The pastry has been loved by the locals for more than 300 years.
Hairy-crab soup dumpling is another "must-try" of the area. The dumpling, with its fillings made of minced pork, crab meat and roe, has a very thin wrapper and plenty of tasty soup. It looks like a flower with a bit of crab roe placed on top of each dumpling.
Unlike another kind of soup dumpling in China, which requires a straw to finish the soup inside first, you can dip this dumpling in vinegar and eat it directly to enjoy the burst of soup in your mouth.
Dried tofu curd in Gaochun is also famous for its delicious flavor. The tofu curd is made locally of fine soy beans, and crafted in a process with more than 10 steps. Gaochun dried tofu curd has two categories: fragrant and smelly.
While many people enjoy the pleasant smell of fragrant tofu curd, which is usually fried with vegetables, locals really prefer the smelly one with its unique flavor.

Although a photographer and painter by her own right, Dora Maar (1907-97) is better known as a lover and muse of Pablo Picasso.
The painting will be auctioned on May 15 by Christie's at its New York sale of impressionism and modern art. The pre-sale estimated price exceeds $35 million.
Critics believe that the work not only reflects Maar's complex personality — she was a creative artist and figure in the surrealistic circles before she met Picasso — but also reveals Picasso's worries about the tense situation in Europe caused by the Spanish civil war and World War II.

L'Oreal seeks to catch up with China's expanding digital market. Sun Yuanqing reports.
The digital age is transforming our lives, not least with our compulsion to record every minute of it. This means keeping up appearances, as who knows if the shot will go viral or last for posterity. And that, of course, means always having the right lipstick.
Showcasing not just a celebrity's appeal as a trend-setter, but also to an extent such brands are perhaps seeking to use the popularity of social media in China to boost the cosmetics industry.
"The digital age is giving beauty more importance than ever," asserts Jean-Paul Agon, who, as chairman and CEO of L'Oreal Group, the world's largest cosmetics company, is well placed to know.
China has grown to be L'Oreal's second-largest market after the United States. L'Oreal, which owns the Maybelline brand, has been working extensively with e-commerce platforms in China, producing live broadcasts featuring celebrities that allow customers to buy while watching the shows.
"And we are just at the beginning of the story," says Agon. "Chinese consumers have huge capacity to change and evolve. They are very open to new ideas and techniques."

To a majority of filmmakers, it is a privilege to have their works shown at the Cannes International Film Festival. Usually, it takes years or lifetime to make the dream come true.
Since 2004, short film producers and directors have chosen the Short Film Corner as the place to present their films and chart their future career. The proposed films are from all over the world and most will make their public debut, according to the official website of Cannes International Film Festival.
Although the plot is simple, it took the producer over a year to finish the film.
"From writing the script to post-production, everything was done by myself. All the details in the movie are the results of constant changes and reviews," Wang said.
"For instance, the changing of rays in the work is something I am proud of. When the boy gets lost in the forest, the glimmering light makes the forest not that scared; when the boy finds the girl with warm lights around her, they offer the boy a silver lining. The difference lights reflect something behind the scenes," Wang added.
The Chinese-style elements are another highlight of the animation.
"Love is an eternal theme for human beings, and my work is no exception. I hope to show a harmonious relationship between human and nature, human and animals in my simple animation," Wang added.
Majoring in computer art design, Wang graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 2016 with great academic achievements.
Due to her persistence and talents in art design, she was chosen by her instructor and keeps exploring the animation world in the daily work.
"Art is a demanding mistress, the pitfalls of endlessly doubting your own ability, the role of creative thinkers in today's shifting sociopolitical climate and the difference between the art world and the world of art...Working as an artist is one of the most difficult things I do, and at the same time it's the only thing I can possibly do," Wang said quoting a speech delivered by the artist Carrie Mae Weems to 1,100 graduates of the School of Visual Arts in 2016.
"When she delivered the speech, I was one of the 1,100 gradates. The speech really impressed me, and it touched me a lot. Just like her said, I will keep going and do something in my artist career," Wang said, smiling.
Mak says he and Chong were invited to do a film about the Chinese mainland police in 2011 and spent four years on research, especially on the mainland judicial system and public security bureaus.
He also says that the movie has the longest action scene — 25 minutes — of all his crime action movies.
Huang Xuan, who plays the undercover policeman, says that he watched a lot of video clips to mimic the gestures of the police. The cast also includes veteran actors Duan Yihong and Xing Jiadong.
Mismatched shoes are suddenly a fashion statement, not the sleepy accident of the absent-minded.
Let us start by pointing out that the correct fashion term for this trend is "mismatched shoes", not odd ones. Wearing "odd shoes", apparently, implies that when you put those two, non-identical brogues on your feet this morning, it was an accident.
The fashion statements made by the street style set at Paris fashion week in February and on social media right now, are entirely deliberate.
It all started on the catwalk at Celine in September, when the instigator of all things cool and off-kilter, Phoebe Philo, sent models wearing odd boots - one black with one brown, one tan with one lemon - down her catwalk. It was simultaneously bold and subtle, the kind of considered styling trick that Philo's fans go wild for.
Like many of her recent fashion impacts (making trainers chic again, paint brush prints, et al) it is one that is easy to copy en masse.
As such, the street stylers have adopted it in real life outside the shows this season. Brooklyn Beckham has been giving it a go in his teenage high-tops and even White House press secretary Sean Spicer was photographed shod in black on one foot and brown on the other. (The photo went viral, but it wasn't quite the way it looked: He wore a brown shoe on one foot. On the other, he donned a dark blue-striped sock with a foot brace, the kind of boot-like contraption you'd wear if you hurt your foot.)
Youngsters visit the bird illustrations show in Beijing. Liu Xiangrui / China Daily
An ongoing exhibition showcasing illustrations of birds by French missionaries in China in the 19th century is running at the Poly Art Museum in Beijing through April 13.
The exhibition, being jointly organized by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation and the Poly Culture Group, is part of celebrations to mark the 36th Beijing Bird Loving Week, which began on Saturday, and to enhance public awareness of biodiversity in the country.
The show includes 746 illustrations describing 416 species, some of which are extinct.
The illustrations combine traditional Chinese painting skills with Western naturalistic techniques to portray different bird species.
Calling it a show of "great artwork" on birds in China, British ornithologist Terry Townshend said at the opening ceremony that it was also a good way to engage the public in efforts to protect biodiversity.
"People want to protect what they love, but they can only love what they know," he said.
The illustration project was run by Pierre Marie Heude, a French missionary priest who came to China in 1868 and helped with the founding of the country's oldest natural history museum in Shanghai's Xujiahui area.
Heude traveled throughout China and spent decades accumulating a valuable collection of zoological and botanical specimens.
Heude became the first director of the Xujiahui museum and conducted natural history studies with his team. He also wrote several books.
The museum is not only the first museum in Shanghai, but a critical part of the history of modern museums in China, Chinese scholars say.
Many items at the museum, especially some mammal specimens, were never seen in Europe before, winning the Xujiahui museum the reputation of a top museum in the Far East and "Asia's British Museum", according to researcher Zhang Jie from the Xuhui District Cultural Bureau in Shanghai.
In 1930, its collection was moved to the museum of natural history at Shanghai's Aurora University and featured in exhibitions, a library and laboratory rooms in the following years.
The former Xujiahui museum had to be closed after most of the foreign missionaries left the country in early 1952. The local government took up the management in the next year, and the items in its collection were transferred to various research institutes and other museums on the Chinese mainland.
The ongoing exhibition in Beijing is being held to honor the museum's contribution in boosting natural history research and inspiring public interest in the field in China.
"This exhibition has high scientific and artistic value. It not only gives vivid descriptions of the birds but also provides lots of relevant information, which allows us to compare the current distribution of birds with that a century ago," says Zhou Jinfeng, secretary general, China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.

The You Bring Charm to the World award ceremony was held in Beijing on March 31. The winners include actress Yao Chen. Provided To China Daily
Movie star Jackie Chan, architect I.M. Pei, astronauts of China's Shenzhou-11 space mission and other leading figures from various fields were honored on March 31 for being 2016's top influencers.
Martial artist and actor Chan said he would act until he is 70 years old after receiving a special award of You Bring Charm to the World, an annual honor given by Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV to those who have greatly influenced people in the country and beyond.
Chan said he once planned to retire at age 40 because he thought his body couldn't afford the tough action scenes in films. But with support from Chinese audiences and the country's growing movie market, he has also done other roles tailored for his age.
"I will act as long as I can move my body. I will try different roles rather than martial arts only, in my own style," he said while accepting the award at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
Liu Changle, chairman and CEO of Phoenix TV, said Chan has created a brave and unbeatable Chinese on world screens.
"Chan is a special envoy who has spread Chinese culture in the world with his martial arts," said Liu.
Chan also sang a birthday song at the award ceremony for fellow winner Pei, who will celebrate his 100th birthday on April 26 in New York. The Chinese-American architect didn't attend the ceremony due to age but received the award at his house in New York.

It slipped a little, from No 20 to No 24, but Hong Kong's Amber restaurant remains firmly ensconced on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list this week. It is the only Hong Kong restaurant on the 2017 list and, like last year, joins Shanghai's Ultraviolet by Paul Pariet (No 41) as the only two restaurants in China to be so lauded.
The annual San Pellegrino-sponsored ranking was announced on April 5 at an awards ceremony in Melbourne, Australia.
"It shows that Amber continues to be recognized as one of the relevant restaurants in a highly competitive world," says Amber's chef Richard Ekkebus., "I would like to thank my team for working with me daily, ensuring our guests a consistency in service and dining experience, and keeping us on the list for seven consecutive years is a truly remarkable achievement."
Two other high-fliers on the previously announced 50 Best Restaurants in Asia list, Bangkok's Gaggan and Nahm, claimed the No 7 and No 28 spots respectively on the world list.

Asia counts seven restaurants in the 2017 line-up, with China, Japan and Thailand each boasting two entries.
Another restaurant with a China tie, Mauro Colagreco's Mirazur in Menton, France, was ranked No 4 on the list. （Azur by Mauro Colagreco is the fine-dining restaurant at the Shangri-La Hotel, Beijing.
In a vote by his global peers, chef-owner Virgilio Martínez of Lima's Central restaurant claimed the 2017 Chef's Choice award. Martinez has helped propel Peru's status as a foodie destination to new heights with constant research and improvement at his flagship restaurant, Central, the three-time No.1 on the Latin America's 50 Best Restaurants list.

Embracing the idea of "Youth and Passion, Academic Taste and Cultural Awareness", the film festival has become an important portal to promote domestic films in previous years.
"In the fields of movie, art and education, it has earned much influence and reputation. Beijing Normal University as the organizer will continue to pay tribute to the achievements of the past and move on confidently," said Li Xiaobing, deputy party secretary of Beijing Normal University.
This year marks the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Therefore, a special unit was created for the opening ceremony of the festival. With the theme "In Tribute to Military Soul", the organizing committee invited over 70 experts and insiders in film and military fields to choose 11 qualified films to reflect on the tremendous changes of the era and record the grand image of Chinese military men in past decades.
"Film, to some degree, is the carrier of certain times. We can reflect on the past and gain inspiration from them in the future," Chinese scholar Yu Dan added.
Meanwhile, a variety of student-oriented events, such as the 18th College Student Film Competition, 8th Filmko Award Colleges Student Script Competition, 3rd Beijing College Student Photography Competition, will he held throughout the one-month film festival.
The theme-film exhibition including the "Belt and Road" unit will also open to the public in upcoming days.
The film festival is organized by Beijing Normal University and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Radio, Film and Television. It is one of the most prestigious film festivals in China, and aims to find more budding film talents.
Dilraba Dilmurat, one of the most popular Uygur actresses on TV, will soon make her movie debut.
The film is about an online novelist's romance with an heir to a wealthy family business.

Can an artist and a chef find meaning together in deep red?
I've climbed an eerily lit staircase to find out. It isn't my usual way to get to dinner, but Tru Wang has made the experience an extra-sensory pleasure.
Wang and Michael Goo are founding partners of Beijing's brand-new art and fashion venue Tru-M, and they used their gallery's opening exhibition earlier this month to combine their passions with food. For the exhibition Virtue, by Korean artist Tae-gyeong Yoon, they invited TRB's chef Franck Pelux to study Yoon's work. The result was a five-course wine-paired menu titled When Art Meets Food & Food Meets Art.
Yoon's works of intertwining lines and dots represent humans' emotional and psychological roadmaps, some of which are being stimulated by our trudge upstairs in the near-dark. When we reach the top, we are nearly enmeshed in a maze of cotton ropes, crafted by Wang to evoke the threads in Yoon's multimedia art. At the end of the maze, the dining room is divided into intimate nooks with tables for two to 10 guests.
The Meaning of Deep Red is a Yoon piece that Pelux re-envisions as a starter plate of Cherry Foie Gras, a potent combination of colors and flavors that Goo says he instantly recognized.
"I know where that dish came from," he says with a grin. "The others? I'm still trying to make the connections."

Esther Mahlangu's colorful geometric artwork is exhibited in galleries around the world, but she remains in her South African village unfazed by fame and determined to preserve her ethnic Ndebele culture.
The 81-year-old painter and mural artist earned an international reputation with her Ndebele motifs at a time when the art scene in her home country was focused on contemporary styles.
Now Johannesburg is hosting a major exhibition for Mahlangu, an elderly black woman with no art training who rose to global acclaim using a skill passed down for generations.
With just a chicken feather, Mahlangu first painted mud huts and chipboards before moving on to luxury cars, vodka bottles, skateboards and footwear as her intricate patterns became huge commercial hits.
At home in a dusty village in South Africa's eastern province of Mpumalanga, the sprightly great-grandmother looks nothing like an artist who has exhibited at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and London's British Museum.

Fan Yanyan is so intrigued by the Silk Road that she established her silk-scarf design studio in a Silk Road museum in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.
The museum's location in Northwest China was the largest market in the capital of the Tang Dynasty (618-907). It's celebrated as the traditional starting point of the Silk Road.
The fine-arts graduate believes many artistic treasures scattered along the ancient international trade route harbor "authentic" inspirations from humanity, religion and nature, rather than modern commercialism.
Unlike her classmates, Fan did not look for jobs after graduating from college in Xi'an in 2000. She went to Dunhuang, Gansu province, to create facsimiles of frescoes in the Mogao Grottoes for two years.
The Mogao Grottoes have more than 45,000 square meters of frescoes and 2,415 painted clay sculptures. It's the world's largest collection of historical Buddhist art, created over the period from the third to 13th centuries, a peak period of international trade and cultural exchanges between Central and South Asia and China.

Alistair Spalding, artistic director at Sadler's Wells, said: "It's an absolute classic love story but it also has tragedy within it and that is what ballet is good at."
The two-hour adaptation is a mix of Western ballet and Chinese influences created by choreographer Fei Bo and artistic director Feng Ying.
"In order to bring this opera into ballet, the script was adapted to suit a dance performance," Feng said. "Our previous artistic director, Madame Zhao Ruheng, and another famous director, Li Liuyi, adapted the original script. Only a few episodes from the original opera were selected and that's how we can tell the story in two hours."
The tale focuses on Du Liniang, a young and wealthy woman who falls asleep and dreams of Liu Mengmei, who she falls in love with in her dream but cannot find in real life. Du dies of a broken heart but is sent back from the underworld to the land of the living so she can find her love.
Choreographer Fei Bo said the company wanted to introduce Western audiences to an Eastern philosophy of love.
"We try to analyze the heroine of the performance in depth and find a contemporary explanation for our audience," said Fei.
Feng added: "Whether it is a Chinese or Western audience, we would like to show our interpretation of this great romantic literature because, in this story, we talk about Chinese philosophy. The idea of life and death, and also the cycle of life and reincarnation. The other important theme is the pursuit of love in reality or in the spiritual world."
The production completed a five-night run in Manchester last week.
The event highlights the growth in cultural links between the countries since President Xi Jinping's visit last year.
Youngsters dream of fame. Entertainment executives dream of making a fortune. Here is where they meet.
Resistance is futile. How can a girl possibly not fall instantly in love with five impish boys and, thus smitten, reach for the "like" button?
Surely, this is part of the calculation of Yue Hua Entertainment, which seems to have timed and choreographed to perfection everything related to the singing and dancing group YHBOYS.
And so it was that five boys, aged 10 to 13, were unfurled in China in a three-and-a-half-minute video called Brand New World a few weeks ago, as the country was awash in the saccharine sentimentality of Valentine's Day.
Little surprise, then, that 24 hours or so after YHBOYS first saw the light of day, their video was reported to have been viewed more than 10 million times. They now have more than 27,000 followers on Sina Weibo.
Getting an early start in show business is not exactly new. After all, American child star Shirley Temple made her debut at the age of 3. But the sudden appearance and instant success of YHBOYS has raised some eyebrows in China.
First, there is the name, with some suggesting it has an uncanny resemblance to TFBoys, a Chinese teen boy band put together by the Beijing company Time Fengjun Entertainment, and which gained rapid popularity, essentially through the internet, after issuing its debut promotional video Ten Years, in August 2013.
However, for every person who raises questions about Yue Hua Entertainment's commercial intent with the latest gaggle of youngsters, there seem to be 100 others who cannot get enough of them and eagerly await more videos - and the merchandise that is doubtless on its way.
To bring the group together, seven boys from Jiangxi and Hebei provinces, the Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Taiwan were chosen from more than 3,000 candidates who applied in an internet talent search, says Du Hua, founder and chief executive of Yue Hua Entertainment, which has been creating Chinese pop idol groups since 2009.
Five of those boys appeared in the video released last month; the two others will appear in two videos to be released on the internet this month. Eventually, more boys will be added to the group.
The recruitment process and getting the boys ready to appear in public took more than two years. Having invested so much time and effort in bringing the YHBOYS together, Du has laid big plans for them. In fact those plans appear to go well beyond China. A Twitter account, @YHBoysGlobal, was set up for them, although for the moment it has just a few hundred followers.
Plans are also afoot for a YHGIRLS group whose members will be between 16 and 18 years old.
"There is huge potential for developing Chinese pop groups. More than 200 pop groups are set up every year. China has a huge population, but only a dozen or so new groups appear each year, and most of them fizzle out, Du says.
"These seven boys are not just good looking but also talented, some playing instruments, such as the guitar and piano, and some dancing hip-hop and speaking English. We want them to be role models for Chinese youngsters."
The members of YHBOYS and their parents contacted for this article declined to be interviewed, but it is apparent that at least one of the boys, who is 11, is already well into his show business apprenticeship.
Zhang Minghao, born in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, made his TV debut when he was 9, performing on Go! Baby!, a variety show produced and aired on Anhui Satellite TV in which youngsters take part in quizzes and show off various talents. Zhang has since appeared in other variety shows aired by Hunan Satellite TV and Beijing TV. Last April he starred in a movie, After School, directed by Liu Yijun, whose theme is school bullying.
The other members of the group are Guo Dianjia, Li Linma, Liu Guanyi, Sun Jiakai, Zhang Enshuo and Zhang Junyi.
Another priority for the company is ensuring that YHBOYS fans get every possible opportunity to observe their training, rehearsals and the minutiae of their daily lives, which in turn becomes fodder for live-streaming on social media.
"It's all about communication," Du says. "The boys grow up and their fans are able to see the ways they are changing and how they are progressing. This kind of bond between the pop group and fans is important."

27-year old Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson was in Beijing last night, promoting her new film "Kong: Skull Island".
In the King Kong reboot, Larson portrays a photojournalist investigating the island's peculiar seismic activity.
She says while the basis of the film itself dates back to the early days of cinema, the message in it remains the same.
"Kong is a huge part of the mythology of cinema; it tells an incredible story that is really timely dealing with the issues that are still dealing with today when it comes to man VS nature. So if we want to talk about agriculture or war, these huge things that we're still grappling with human beings and trying to find a way, instead of fighting with something, to actually work with it. And I think this is such a great way of telling that story in a way that's still fun, entertaining and interesting to watch."
The film also stars Chinese actress Jing Tian, who was also out on Thursday for the film's premier.
"Kong: Skull Island" is due to open across China on Friday of next week.

Based on one of China's most significant writers, Lao She's novel with the same title, the play is directed, adapted and performed by veteran Chinese actor Fang Xu, who is a loyal fan of Lao She (1899-1966).
The cast members of the play are all male actors, including Fang as Mr Ma and Liu Xinran, a Peking Opera actor known for nan dan (men playing women's roles), as Mrs Wedderburn.
The stage is dominated by a huge newspaper, which the director says is a symbol of London in the 1920s. A band performs live onstage, which according to Fang, functioning as a character in the play.
The 50-year-old Fang graduated from the directing department of the Central Academy of Drama. A Beijing native who spent his youth in a courtyard of a hutong area, he feels connected to Lao She’s stories.
"The characters in his works remind me of my neighbors in the hutong when I was a child. They are so ordinary, vivid and real — fascinating to me," he said in an early interview.

At a promotional event in Beijing held on Sunday afternoon, the actor-turned director has vowed to surprise viewers with an image of actor Zhang Hanyu they've never seen before.
"Zhang Hanyu and I are actually close friends. Based on my knowledge about him, he's a funny guy who may often entertain people around him. So the character he portrays in my movie reflects how he looks like in real life and generates a lot of fun. And this contradicts his previous film roles that usually look very serious."
The film was shot in France.

Viewers earlier had expected the series to fail, given their experiences in recent years with shows full of historical inaccuracies and poor storytelling. But it was a surprisingly popular production. The 60-episode series premiered on Jan 29, on Beijing TV, Anhui TV and a Tencent online platform, during this year's Spring Festival.
By last week, it had more than 4 billion views on Tencent, with the rating on the site reaching 8.3 of 10.
"TV series targeted at the youth aren't necessarily away from mainstream values," Jiang Lei, vice-president of H&R Century Pictures, which created the series, recently told a Beijing event. "We aim to bring out the essence of traditional Chinese culture and use modern expressions and approaches to attract young people."
"We had to conform to basic historical facts while writing the script," says Liu Fang, the scriptwriter of the series. "Then we placed fictional plots into the framework. The romance created a foundation for the story but it also sought to express a love for the country."
Director Liu Guonan says when he first read the script, he felt that romance was the dominant theme. So he asked his team to get the historical context into the picture.
Her performance in the series seems to have broken that record, although some say it could be attributed in part to the costumes and script.
"Though historical TV series have dominated our screens, it's surprising that no big production earlier focused on the An Shi Rebellion, a key event in Chinese history," says Liu Yeyuan, a media professor at the Communication University of China. "Until now, young people's understanding of the time was largely rooted in Tang poetry. The new series offers them a chance to revisit history."
Liu Yeyuan also says the exchanges between China and other countries along the ancient Silk Road can create an emotional resonance today.
Yin Hong, a media professor at Tsinghua University, say: "Making a successful youth-genre TV series doesn't mean just hiring popular young idols. Instead, it means to create figures that have positive energy and echo what young people pursue today."
Even so, Yin says this production has its drawbacks.
Chinese actor-director Wen Zhang teams up with his wife, Ma Yili, to lead star a forthcoming TV series.
Set in early 1930s, the tale fictionalizes a series of thrilling espionage activities in Harbin, which was invaded by Japanese forces then.
Wen recalls he received the script during a vacation journey to the United States last year.
"I once decided to take a longer break and almost forgot the script. But my wife was deeply attracted by the tale and hurried me to read it," he recalls.
Ma says the series relives the turbulence in history as well as ordinary people's struggles in the chaotic years.

This past summer, when most Chinese college students were dazzled by choices of holiday plans, Wang Chaodi jumped into one of the hottest travel trends, "voluntourism" for an unconventional holiday.
The Yunnan University junior spent three weeks immersed in African culture while participating in community service in Nairobi, Kenya.
"I want to go to the farthest end of the Earth to help people who are most in need," says the 22-year-old law student.
On weekdays, he taught elementary courses at an impoverished inner-city orphanage－a 300-square-meter space packed with houses, a feedlot and a ragged teaching shed－where "skinny students", as Wang puts it, have only a single outdated textbook to study from.
During weekends, Wang went on a safari to tourist sites including Masai Mara National Reserve and Amboseli Park, where he could observe exotic animals.
"Voluntourism", also known as volunteer tourism, combines volunteer work with travel. A global phenomenon, it is gaining momentum among young Chinese, especially college students.

China's new film industry law provides the regulation needed to help bring the fast-growing market into a golden era, according to industry insiders.
The law, which took effect March 1, clarifies punishment for fabrication of box office revenue, increases government investment in the industry and reduces taxes, among other provisions.
Over the past few years, the film industry has developed into one of the most active and bright fields in China's cultural sector.
According to the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT), China's box office sales in 2016 reached 45.71 billion yuan ($6.64 billion), up 3.73 percent year on year.
China produced 944 films in 2016, and the box office sales of domestic films topped 26.66 billion yuan, accounting for 58.33 percent of total box office sales, the SAPPRFT said.
The law will help develop China's film industry, which has grown rapidly in past years and entered a period of stable improvement, said Yin Hong, a professor at Tsinghua University, in a report by the People's Daily.
Yin compared the law to a measuring stick for government regulators and film industry professionals to set legal standards in communication, trade and competition.
The law protects intellectual property and delivers a blow to fabricated box office figures as well as pirated copies of films, said Zhang Hongsen, head of the film bureau at the SAPPRFT.
Cultural confidence
Zhang said that the law also plays a role in promoting Chinese movie exports to extend visibility and impact overseas.
Zhang was echoed by La Peikang, chairman of China Film Co., Ltd., who said that China should promote more movies overseas that tell Chinese stories.
La also emphasized "cultural confidence", telling good Chinese stories, attracting audience and ensuring the sustainable development of the film industry through regulation.
Although box office revenues account for just a small portion of China's GDP, Yin said, movies have immeasurable value for its national image, tourism, advertising, fashion and international trade.
Yin added that starting from World War I, films have been part of the development strategy of the United States. China's new law protects intellectual property and encourages film-related merchandise and licensing. These gestures "reflect the important role of movies in China's overall development strategy," said Yin.
Revenues and praise
Quality movies cannot be made crudely for quick profits, said Yu Dong, CEO of Bona Film Group. Instead, quality movies are the result of cultural confidence and the spirit of craftsmanship, he continued.
In addition to high-quality movies, La pointed out the need to address problems such as fabricating box office earnings.
"The film industry law shoots the arrow at these areas in legal form and will bring more order and prosperity to the industry," said La.
China's box office revenues have been increasing at 30 percent for almost ten years. The slowing growth rate last year has spurred extensive concerns. However, Zhang disagreed that this suggests an inflexion point.
In order to protect film workers, China needs to establish a system in which good movies get good returns, said Yu.
The law specifies that people working in the film industry must strive for "excellence in both professional skills and moral integrity," maintain self-discipline and create a positive public image.
Ning Hao, a director and scriptwriter, suggested a sense of honor for film workers to complement current market standards.

People wait in a line to buy buns of Master Bao at its first Shanghai outlet in People's Square. CAO CHEN/CHINA DAILY
Shanghai may be well-known for being a fast-paced city that never sleeps, but there is one thing that its residents will slow down for－food.
The latest food craze in the city involves a palm-sized bun topped with dried-meat floss and shredded sea sedges, something many Shanghai-nese normally dislike because of its coarseness.
The bun is sold by Master Bao, which was first established in a quiet residential neighborhood in Beijing in 2009. The company opened its first Shanghai outlet in People's Square in early February, right after the Spring Festival holiday.
Today, the line outside the shop can stretch hundreds of meters and customers have waited for several hours during peak times. The snack sells for between 19 and 29 yuan ($2.80 to $4.20) per 500 grams, depending on the type of floss.
"I called in sick at work just so I could wait in line and buy this bread for my girlfriend, who has been craving it for weeks," says a hotel manager who had been waiting for nearly two hours on a weekday afternoon. "This is the first and perhaps last time that I will spend so much time waiting to buy a snack."
Bao Caibin, the store manager of the Shanghai outlet, says that the craze in Shanghai is even bigger than what took place in Beijing and Tianjin. He says the line starts to form as early as 5 am and lasts till midnight. The store is currently limiting each customer to 2 kilograms of bread.
It remains a mystery to most foodies why the snack has become such a phenomenal hit. Unlike other wildly popular products like mooncakes filled with spicy crayfish meat or sticky rice balls stuffed with salted duck-egg yolk, there is nothing new or innovative about Master Bao's buns. Similar products have been sold at most bakeries across the city for many years.
Most of the customers who were waiting in the line said they were simply influenced by social media posts.
On Taobao, China's largest online shopping portal, people have been flocking to place their orders with dai-gou (shopping on behalf of someone else) services.
The website showed that more than 10,000 such deals for the buns were made over the past 30 days. A shop assistant says that nearly one-third of the orders are placed by customers in Shanghai.
While most daigou businesses charge a fee ranging from 5 to 20 percent of the price of the product, the most popular daigou store on Taobao is selling the buns at the same price as Master Bao, citing the fact that they are buying these snacks in bulk from Beijing.
The shop, which charges a delivery fee of 23 yuan, guarantees customers in Shanghai that they will receive their buns within 48 hours.

Jackie Chan has opened a new exhibit in Shanghai, combining the themes of filmmaking and recycling.
The exhibit features more than 40 pieces of movie props and other items from Chan's legendary career, and they have all been re-made and transformed into works of art by 25 artists from around the world.
Chan says that over the years, he has collected many items from his movie sets that would have otherwise simply gone into the garbage after filming.
He has then shown or given them to his artist friends, who have reused them to create sculptures or other objects of new artistic value.

Chan says he is hoping to promote the ideas of recycling and environmental protection through the exhibit, which is also set to travel around the world after its showing in Shanghai.
The Hong Kong action star, who is about to turn 64 next month, has appeared in well over 200 films.
Last year, he received a Lifetime Achievement Oscar for his contribution to the film industry. He is also well known for a wide range of public service and charity projects.
The current exhibition in Shanghai can be seen in the city's World Financial Center until May 21.

As we nibble deliciously tender loin of lamb－stuffed and breaded, then prettily tucked in leaves of savory cabbage－we ask visiting Italian chef Damiano Nigro about his restaurant's Michelin star.
Is it such a big deal in Europe nowadays?
"Of course," he says, adding that business has doubled at the Villa d'Amelia in Italy's beautiful Piedmont region since the star was awarded.
China's seeming obsession with Michelin-rated chefs, heightened by the new guide for Shanghai, is relatively new, but on the continent where the guide began more than a century ago, star awareness remains strong.
Nigro's success may be due to the "modern traditionalist" approach he brings this week to Beijing, where he's doing a guest-chef stint for five days at TRB-Bites. "We still love the traditional flavors of our regional cuisine," he says, "but the old ways of cooking are too heavy for today's tastes." The modern approach is healthier, he says: "More vegetables, less fat, flavors that are clean and fresh."
While some visiting chefs pack an insulated suitcase full of their preferred produce, Nigro felt no need to do that. The TRB restaurant group's well-regarded European kitchen has established sources, and he simplified his menu a bit to avoid the need for lengthy plating rehearsals in his host kitchen.
"I pretty much came straight from the airport to the restaurant," he says with a grin.

Big eyes, rouged cheeks, yellow feathers and most importantly, exaggerated facial expressions - this pair of what seems to be chickens looks funny and naughty. But wait…if you take a closer look, you'll see these birds are actually parrots.
Known as the No.1 newly emerging web celebrities of 2017, the Poinko Brothers have been widely used on Chinese social networks at the start of the Year of the Rooster during the Chinese Spring Festival period, as they are mistaken for a pair of chickens by most people.
As of Feb 9, the characters were a hot topic, discussed 27.33 million times on the Sina Weibo platform, a Chinese version of Twitter, and won the favor of an overwhelming number of domestic netizens.
"They have replaced Kumamon as my new favorites. Every time I post my status to show my current mood, I will attach a picture of them because they can bring more likes from my friends," Weibo user Po Xiaohai said online.
Origins of the parrot brothers
As they are so hugely popular, you might wonder about the origin of the emerging stars.
Actually, they are the newly released mascots by NTT DOCOMO, Japan's largest telecommunications company, to attract customers and promote products.
They belong to the Poinko family. The parrot with a long face and three hairs is the elder brother while the one with the round face and one hair is the younger brother.
The elder brother loves his younger brother very much and likes to tell many jokes to amuse him. The younger brother loves sweet food and tries to lose weight but always ends in failure.
They are the most famous characters, but do not represent the whole Poinko family. Other members include 20,086-year-old Poinko Master, Poinko Sister, who is crazy about love and Poinko Doctor, who has 10 hairs on the head.
They were created in December 2015 and were featured in many eye-catching advertisements for the company throughout 2016. In addition, their dancing has gone viral on Japan's internet.
National Theater Live, an initiative launched by the Royal National Theater in London in 2009 to broadcast live performances of its productions to cinemas, has come to China's Central Academy of Drama in Beijing, marking the project's first foray into China's universities.
National Theater Live came to China in 2015 and so far 16 plays have been screened in 28 cinemas across China, for more than 120,000 viewers.

The exhibition, which evolved from a radio program jointly produced by the British Museum and British Broadcasting Corporation in 2010, is currently on at Beijing's National Museum of China, and is causing quite a stir.
Nine Chinese objects, including a 3,000-year-old bronze ritual vessel and a Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) blue-and-white plate, are on show, although there is a disappointment about the absence of the Admonitions Scroll, a precious 6th-century Chinese painting, which was featured in the radio program.
The 100-episode radio series introduced one object from the London museum's collection in each show and navigated innovations in art, technology and industry spanning different cultures, over the course of 2 million years of human history.
When it was first broadcast, the program was followed by 11 million listeners. And now, you can download the broadcasts from a website devoted to the project.
Hartwig Fischer, the German director of the British Museum, says the exhibition shows forces that pushed humans beyond the horizon of Africa, and it shows that globalization is a "powerful development" and "a process that can not be turned back or halted".

As part of the cultural activities to mark the 45th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic ties, an exhibition dedicated to the Dongba culture of China's ethnic Naxi group opened in Tokyo last week.
More than 50 oil paintings created by contemporary Chinese painter Liu Liqun are on display at the China Cultural Center in the Japanese capital.
Liu is skillful in adding ethnic elements to his paintings. He is so enthusiastic about the Dongba culture - a unique culture of the Naxi people in Southwest China's Yunnan province - that he stayed in Yunnan for over three years to study the local history and art.
The Dongba culture dates back over a thousand years. The ancient Naxi people created pictographic characters called the Dongba script in the seventh century, which is now the only pictographic character system existing in the world.
During the three-year work, Liu has successfully fused the mysterious Dongba scripts and the techniques used in local rock paintings in his art creation.
Chokers
Chokers only began to resurface in the latter half of 2016, but they definitely earned their place among the trendiest items of the year. Chokers, along with destroyed jeans and bra tops, may be on the list of "fashion items your parents can never understand", but they do add that extra kick and a touch of retro-ness.

Chinese actor Deng Chao seems to have confirmed that he is set to appear in a new film directed by famed director Zhang Yimou.
Over the weekend, the actor posted on his Weibo account a photo of a script cover with his name written on it. The caption of the photo said in Chinese "Hello everyone, I am Zhang Yimou," suggesting that the film is to be directed by the internationally known filmmaker.
During a public appearance at the Loyola Marymount School of Film and TV in Los Angeles last month, Zhang confirmed that he is working on an untitled historical drama focused on the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history.

Deng Chao had been rumored to star in the new project, along with other big names like Gong Li and Yang Yang.
The Three Kingdoms Period refers to a span of 60 years in the 3rd century, when the Kingdoms of Wei, Shu and Wu dominated what is currently central, southern and eastern China.

Uruguayan Tomahawk steaks are among the recent imported items on offer by GroupMall.[Photo provided to China Daily]
Gianmarco Meli grew up in Sicily, he says, "but I did a student exchange in Sweden and I loved the experience of living abroad."
So he didn't think twice when he was offered an internship with a food-importing business in China three years ago.
That experience had two results: It connected him with importers and suppliers, and he also heard from many friends who struggled to find consistent quality in imported foods they liked at a good price.
So he found a partner with a background in IT, and pitched their idea for a food-buying platform in a competition run by Silicon Valley venture capitalists. The idea was to make group buys on specialty items: There would be a quota for shares to be purchased, then GroupMall would buy in bulk, divide the goods, and ship everything from steaks to organic brown rice to the shareholders.
The plan captured the judges' interest, and GroupMall was born. Successfully launched in co-working space in Shanghai, the company is weaning itself off its start-up capital, preparing its own office space－and this month, branching out to Beijing.
Besides group buying, GroupMall offers about a half-dozen "hot deals" to its followers each week. Recent items included Uruguayan Tomahawk steaks, coconut water and chips, blueshell mussels, gluten-free snacks, grain-fed beef prime rib and grass-fed beef cuberoll.
While imported items are most in demand, Meli also looks for quality, hard-to-find foods from within China. He's connected with Tibetan growers of black truffles as well as Dutchman Marc de Ruiter, whose Shanxi-based Yellow Valley Cheese company produces organic, fair-trade Gouda in several flavors.
Pingyao, a 2,700-year-old town in Shanxi province, will hold the Pingyao Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon International Film Festival from Oct 19 to 26.
The event is initiated by Chinese director Jia Zhangke. Italian movie producer and critic Marco Muller, who is the festival's art director, announced the official name of the event during a news conference on Thursday in Beijing.
The event is organized by newly founded Pingyao International Film Festival Co under the guidance of Shanxi and Pingyao's relevant government departments.
The festival will include six sections, including two special parts named "Crouching Tiger" and "Hidden Dragon" respectively to bring attention to new directors and genre films.
An international consultant team made of professional filmmakers and critics has been assembled to select more than 40 films from different countries for guests and audience participating in the festival.
The festival, which will mainly show non-Western movies, intends to strengthen ties and cooperation between Chinese movie industry partakers with their counterparts in non-Western countries, especially developing countries.
Pingyao was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997 and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in China. In 2016, it received more than 10 million tourists.
The film festival project has involved constructing a cultural industrial park, which will house movie exhibition areas, art communities and a production studio, at the former site of the Pingyao diesel engine factory in the ancient town.
The festival will boost the local movie industry and help Pingyao become an industrial cluster for culture in North China, commented Jia earlier.
As an experienced film producer, Muller also offered valuable suggestions on staging the event. In his opinion, the film festival should highlight Pingyao's unique cultural characteristics.

Models present Giada's 2017 fall/winter collection at Milan Fashion Week late last month. The collection continues the label's minimalist vibe, combining sophisticated draping with upscale materials. [Photo provided to China Daily]
There are many layers to a woman's character－minimalist and sophisticated, elegant but powerful, fashion-forward yet effortless－just like Italian luxury brand Giada recently showed at Milan Fashion Week.
The brand showcased its 2017 fall/winter collection at the historical national library, Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense, on Feb 26.
Inspired by German artist Katrin Bremermann and American designers Charles and Ray Eames, the collection continues the label's minimalist vibe, combining sophisticated draping with upscale materials.
The latest collection features oversized woolen and cashmere coats, and the mohair sweaters come with pleated silk chiffon skirts, creating a relaxed and effortless look.
The skirts are printed on both sides, creating a dynamic, fluid effect as the models walk by.
Giada's classic palette of gray, navy and white are enlivened by terracotta, red, green and olive.
Jewelry inspired by British artist Barbara Hepworth's abstract sculptures adorn the models' necklines, belts and wrists.
"I think that, that don't judge a book by its cover, look beyond the superficial. And I think it also celebrates the idea that love takes on this almost soul connection, the spiritual connection, this bigger connection. As you say, we need to be reminded of that now more than ever," said Watson.
Disney's animation of the story in 1991 was a worldwide hit, featuring an Oscar- and Grammy-winning original song of the same title by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. The song has been covered by John Legend and Ariana Grande ahead of the release of the new film, and a Chinese version has also been preformed by Tian Fuzhen and Jing Boran. Celine Dion has been asked to perform a new song for the latest release, titled "How Does A Moment Last Forever".

Asparagus [Photo provided to China Daily]
Four questions for Jacky Tauvry, the chef de cuisine at Pierre, the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong's two Michelin-starred restaurant.
Is spring truly a time of anticipation for chefs?
Cooks always love springtime because it's the season of new vegetables, herbs, flowers and the first mushrooms.
What are the star foods of springtime and how do you prepare them?
Asparagus, morel mushrooms and new ratte potatoes from Noirmoutier are the queens of springtime. Then there are the miniature leeks and miniature carrots – all those little things that are so tasty and so pretty, and that bring such colour and freshness to dishes. The three main asparagus varieties are green, white and purple. This year, we're serving green asparagus with a piece of sea bream cooked slowly in citrus butter, and a salad made with fresh spring herbs like burnet, chervil, parsley and lemon balm. We also do a cream of Noirmoutier potatoes with a grapefruit reduction that we serve with poultry or fish. We cook morels in cream with all the new vegetables – it's very refreshing.

What are your criteria when selecting your ingredients?
We're a French restaurant, so we work only with small French producers we know, who respect the product and the environment. For example, we select asparagus from growers in Touraine or Pertuis, which are France's asparagus capitals. The asparagus has a unique, delicately sweet taste. It's important because most of the asparagus you find in supermarkets here is industrially produced – the quality is totally different.
Have you got an asparagus recipe to share with our readers?
A very simple recipe is to peel some green asparagus stalks, cook them for five minutes in boiling water and then cool them in ice water. Arrange thin slices of comté on top and brown under the grill of your oven – delicious.

There are brands that are pretty much the face of their industry. Zippo, known for its iconic lighters, is one of them. The brand is celebrating its 85th anniversary this year.
The brand has been growing at about 10 percent in China for the past 10 years. And China is now its top overseas market after the United States.
About 60 percent of its sales come from the US and 25 percent from China.
China also takes up about 20 percent of its annual international marketing budget.
Despite the general sluggish retail scene, China has continued to grow, says Warfel.
"There have been changes. But Zippo has been able to continue to grow dramatically in the Chinese market," says Warfel.
Like everywhere else, the windproof lighter is the most popular model in China.
The brand launched a 360-degree marketing strategy that covers traditional media, social, digital and online marketing. It sponsors rock festivals around the world to reach its target audiences.
For the brand's 85th anniversary, the brand is launching a limited edition model in April.
Founded in Bradford in Pennsylvania in 1932, the brand is best known for its windproof lighters, and it estimates that there are about 4 million Zippo collectors in the US.
The brand is now sold in more than 120 countries around the world.
So, besides its iconic lighters, the brand also offers men accessories like wallets, key chains and money clips.
In 2004, the company acquired Italian leather producer D.D.M and started to produce leather goods.

With a picture frame as the canvas, incredible culinary creations were hatched at Barolo's dining room as Italian chef Amedeo Ferri made the last course, the dessert, for his guests.
The creation was vivid and colorful, and all the "paint" he threw on the glass was eatable. Black was the Valrhona chocolate, red the raspberry jam, pink the strawberry ice cream, white the yoghurt, green the mint, and pistachio paste.
Not only was Ferri presenting his new creation, he was also saluting the late Chinese artist Zhu Danian (1916-1995), a master in Chinese meticulous painting with heavy colors and pioneer in modern porcelain.
He was approached by Zhu's grandchildren as the family was looking for ways to remember the artist on his 100th birth anniversary. Ferri had previously worked with artists to create food menus, but he knew he needed time for research.
China's aid to the education sector in Africa is helping boost teacher training, a key component in skilling the population to fast track development, a UN official has said.
Ann Therese Ndong-Jatta, director of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Regional Office for Eastern Africa, in a recent interview recognized China's contribution to Africa's education sector over the years.
"We value the initiative in teacher training in Uganda and other countries in Africa. This will revitalize the teaching profession," she says.
China through UNESCO donated equipment to three teacher-training institutions in Uganda on March 3. Figures from the Chinese embassy here show that 137 tutors were trained and 272 pieces of information communication and technology and studio equipment were donated.
Ndong-Jatta says tutors were skilled on how to integrate technology with traditional methods of training.
China through UNESCO is funding an $8 million project aimed at narrowing the educational quality gap on the continent.
The project, Enhancing Teacher Education for Bridging the Education Quality Gap in Africa, aims to accelerate progress toward the achievement of Education for All and the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which is quality education.
The four-year project that started in 2012 focused on providing a sufficient number of qualified teachers in Africa through training programs.
Eight African countries－Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Namibia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Liberia, Tanzania, and Uganda－are benefiting from the program.
Ndong-Jatta says besides cooperation in primary education, China has been cooperating with Africa to boost higher education.
China helped set up the Capacity Building Institute of Teacher Education in Ethiopia, and the regional director says some African countries also had student and teacher exchange programs with China.
She says a conference has been scheduled in Djibouti to discuss how to boost further cooperation with China in the area of higher education.

Two New Zealand universities will host new government-funded research institutes to bolster understanding of the Asia-Pacific region, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Paul Goldsmith says.
The Centres of Asia-Pacific Excellence at the University of Auckland and Wellington's Victoria University will specialize in the languages, cultures, politics and economics of countries or groups of countries in the region, says Goldsmith.
Auckland will lead a group of universities in the North Asia center, covering China, Japan and South Korea, while Victoria will lead two centers, one focusing on Southeast Asia and one on Latin America.
"They are an important and strategic investment in New Zealand's future. So much of our trade, tourism and migration is focused on the Asia-Pacific region. It makes sense to deepen our understanding of it," Goldsmith says in a statement.
As well as teaching about and researching the countries, each institute will be mandated to help learners, exporters, and government agencies improve their understanding of the countries and their languages.
"The new CAPEs will provide initiatives and programs of use to small and medium enterprises wanting to grow their understanding of the Asian and Latin American markets," says Goldsmith.
"The centers will also help individuals better prepare to do business and connect with the Asia-Pacific region."
The government allocated the CAPE program NZ$34.5 million ($23.83 million) over four years in last year's budget.
The North Asia and Southeast Asia institutes will use the expertise of the Asia New Zealand Foundation, which welcomed the announcement, saying too many New Zealanders lacked confidence in engaging with Asia.
"For example, we've seen the number of secondary students learning Asian languages drop by a third in the past decade," foundation executive director Simon Draper says in a statement.
"If we are to succeed in Asia, we need to move beyond our current transactional approach, and invest time and resources in understanding what makes Asian countries tick. We need to build sustainable relationships based on an understanding of each other's cultures, histories and economies."
The University of Auckland's existing North Asian centers and institutes include the Confucius Institute, jointly established by the University of Auckland, Fudan University in Shanghai and the Office of Chinese Language Council International, based in Beijing; and the New Zealand Centre at Beijing's Peking University, which was launched in 2007 as a joint initiative of the two universities.


The producer has released the latest poster for the movie, and in the poster, Jack Sparrow and Captain Salazar stare at each other, ready for a fight.
This face-to-face poster style is often taken advantage of by movie producers. The style makes the main characters stand out and arouses more discussion among movie-goers which helps promote the movie.

Restaurants across China join the Gout de France, an event that spreads French culinary traditions around the world at the start of spring. [Photo provided to China Daily]
For Yohan Fatela, the French chef at Heritage restaurant in the Wanda Sofitel, every day is about celebrating his country's cuisine.
But the past week has been more intense than usual. Saturday night his restaurant team hosted Chaine des Rotisseurs, a centuries-old group of gourmands founded in France, with active chapters in Beijing and Shanghai. On Tuesday night, he joins the third annual Gout de France (Good France), along with about 2,000 chefs from five continents who will present a special menu on the spring equinox, widely celebrated as the first day of spring.
In 1912, Auguste Escoffier started Les Diners d'Epicure (Epicurean Dinners): one day, one menu, served in cities around the world, to as many guests as possible. Gout de France, the event's website says, "aims to bring this idea to life by assembling all kinds of restaurants across the globe". The first event, in 2015, was organized to spread French cuisine around the world following its inscription to UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Danish Academy Award-winning director Bille August will also be the jury president for the main competition where 15 films are shortlisted for various sections of the festival's Tiantan Awards.
Beijing Film Panorama has become a carnival for movie fans, screening many outstanding foreign films and old classic Chinese films that never had the chance for wide screenings before. This year, nearly 500 such films will be screened in 30 theaters in Beijing for 16 days.
The Beijing International Film Festival will be held from April 16 - 23. The Beijing Film Panorama screenings will start one week earlier, from April 8.

The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam welcomed home two paintings by the Dutch master on Tuesday, more than 14 years after they were ripped off the museum's wall in a nighttime heist.
"They're back," says museum director Axel Rueger.
He calls their return one of the "most special days in the history of our museum".
The paintings, the 1882 View of the Sea at Scheveningen, and 1884-85 work Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen, were discovered last year by Italian police investigating suspected Italian mobsters for cocaine trafficking.
It wasn't an easy find. The two paintings were wrapped in cotton sheets, stuffed in a box and hidden behind a wall in a toilet, says Gianluigi D'Alfonso of the Italian financial police, who was on hand at the museum to watch the ceremonial unveiling.
They were found in a farmhouse near Naples as Italian police seized some 20 million euros ($21.59 million) worth of assets, including villas, apartments and even a small airplane.
Investigators contend the assets are linked to two Camorra drug kingpins, Mario Cerrone and Raffaele Imperiale.
"After years shrouded in darkness, they can now shine again," Dutch Minister for Education, Culture and Science Jet Bussemaker said as an orange screen slid away to reveal the two paintings behind a glass wall.
Italy's Interior Minister Angelino Alfano says last year the paintings were "considered among the artworks most searched for in the world, on the FBI's list of the Top 10 art crimes".
They are now back on display at the museum before being taken to its conservation studio for repair, although they suffered remarkably little damage as thieves who had clambered up a ladder and smashed a window to get into the museum in 2002 ripped them out of their frames and fled.
"It is not only a miracle that the works have been recovered, but it's even more miraculous almost that they are in relatively unharmed condition," Rueger says.
The two small works are not typical of Van Gogh's later and better-known works, but are still vital pieces for the museum's collection, Rueger says.
Rueger says the paintings are now back for good at a museum, which is home to dozens of works by Van Gogh, whose paintings fetch millions of dollars on the rare occasions they come up for auction.

The Ministry of Culture announced plans on Wednesday to enhance supervision and regulation of the artwork market.
The ministry said eight operators of art exhibition and trade nationwide from different province-level administrative regions including Beijing, Jiangsu, and Liaoning, will be punished following a recent investigation.
The violators were mainly condemned for trading forgeries, artworks including materials forbidden by law like fossils, and imported pieces without approvals from relevant authorities.
In 2016, the ministry announced a rule regulating art-piece dealers.
Liu Luping, an official with the artwork market department under the ministry, particularly noted that regulation on imported artworks is to be enhanced: Dealing in such works is not allowed without government approval, and operators have to apply to province-level cultural administrations 45 days prior to exhibitions that include imported art pieces.
Cultural heritages and mass-produced industrial products are not included as "artworks" in the regulations.

Time was a challenge for all eight finalists, who had to introduce themselves and answer a flurry of questions from the five judges as they stirred and shook their concoctions.
Why did you pick that ingredient?
What made you want to be a bartender?
Why should you be the one to represent China?
Zou, whose smoky infusions and house-made bitters have made his Botany bar a cocktail destination in China's capital, pulled off a carefully paced presentation of his black-truffle cocktail to win, with Edison Wei from Shanghai's Taste Buds and Jamie He from Beijing's Janes and Hooch respectively claiming the second and third spots.
Zou's recipe included using a bit of cognac to cook down the herbs and spices in the drink. He also used black sugar from Yunnan to give the drink some minerality－"it's not too sweet," he says.
Jamie He used Chinese fruits and a story with a rich history－a Tang Dynasty (618-907) emperor who devoted years to pleasing his lady－to develop her recipe. "Would you pay 1,000 yuan for this cocktail?" one judge asked. Her reply was a confident "Of course." She added cherry to match the rich flavor of the premium rum, and finished the drink with oolong-infused vermouth.
Wei built his rum cocktail on the title and theme Winter Is Coming, citing the warming quality of chocolate, which he used as a final garnish.
Zou heads for next month's semi-finals in Venezuela, joining the winners of heats from 40 countries and regions. He will compete with the winners and the best from that group will be one of 12 finalists who travel to London in June for Ron Diplomatico's world championship.
"That's a tough draw for China," says Joe Mannella, the rum's China importer. "But China's cocktail market is developing very fast," he adds, "and I think the five best bars in the Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong are as good as bars anywhere."
A key aim of the competition, which is held in alternate years, is to take top bartenders to Venezuela to experience the distillery, says Patrizia Damiani, Ron Diplomatico's marketing manager. That's why the semifinals, not the finals, will be in Venezuela, so that all 40 nations and regions in the competition can see the culture of the company's rum-making up close.
The China final was held last week at Mesh bar in Beijing's Opposite House hotel.

Applying the in-vogue "Farm to Table" concept into his new spring menu, chef Jerome Merlo aims to provide authentic French food in a relaxed atmosphere. This season, he presents French bistro using the organic vegetables and herbs from The Temple House hotel's very own herb garden. Particularly entrancing: a waffle made of parmesan cheese and beer for a distinctive taste and texture. High-quality marinated mushrooms enrich this dish and give it a forest influence. Pecans add crunch, and the cream cheese ties everything together, he says. The assemblage is a modern bite that will especially please vegetarians and cheese lovers.

A total of 326 cinemas nationwide were punished for box office fraud, following investigations into violations of the law on the film industry that went into effect on March 1.
According to a Tuesday report by regulators, 63 cinemas were involved in box fraud of around 1 million yuan (about $145,000) and the cinemas in question will be closed for at least 90 days from March 27. Screening permits were revoked for reassessment.
Another 63 cinemas, including one in Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang province were closed for at least 60 days, due to fraud of between 500,000 yuan to 1 million yuan. Another 110 cinemas face fines of 200,000 yuan.
The remainder involved in fraud of less than 100,000 yuan received warnings. Cinema managers were also punished.
An official with the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said box office fraud hampers the development of the industry, and called for continuous action against violations.
China adopted the film industry law in November 2016, after years of research and three rounds of deliberation, to address problems such as red tape in film making and poor copyright protection.

Fern, we're told, is an eccentric physician entranced by his study of botanicals. His passion for nature has led him to open his gin joint, where he soothes his patients' ailments and stress-related symptoms with his personal concoctions of fresh local herbs and botanicals paired with gins. Ingredients are hand-picked from local farms, organic whenever possible.
There are premium teas－selected for properties to relax, detox and give an immunity boost－and coffees as well, but creative gin cocktails by Gerry Olino and his team are the big draw here. These are crafted to exude a variety of flavors from fruity to spicy. The good doctor's extensive inventory of over 250 types of gin includes the sought-after and extremely rare Blind Tiger Gin.
Seasonal cocktails will change daily based on ingredients, but you can always count on a gin and tonic, for which the bar team uses a very tall and slim Collins glass that helps trap carbonation and concentrates the aroma. The space, designed like a vintage apothecary, is part of the Ming Fat House family.

Lai will show his new talents behind the camera in the forthcoming thriller.
The movie, which will open across the Chinese mainland on May 19, portrays a shoot'em-up quest to possess a precious bottle of red wine produced in 1855.
Lai plays the lead.
The cast also includes supermodel-turned-actress Du Juan, Taiwan actor David Wang and model-actor Nan Fulong from Tianjin.
Lai says China's historical connection with wine culture inspired the plot.
"I've read some papers that say China made red wine as long ago as during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). I then learned some top Chinese winemakers immigrated to Europe centuries ago," Lai says.

If you're heading to Beijing's Qianmen area this weekend for a jazzy night at one of Chick Corea's shows, it's also a good time to try Blue Note's new spring menu while you are there.
A good start: crispy soft-shell crab with avocado panna cotta, apple salad, passion fruit and chili sauce, a soft and delicate appetizer with a spicy edge.
"We vary our menu based on seasonal ingredients," says chef Han Guodong.
The pickled mackerel with mackerel ice cream layers the frozen sweetness with a slightly sour taste, which is enhanced with crisp rye bread crumbs. Acidic pickle juice is mixed in the ice cream as well.
"The fish meat has to be marinated for at least a week," the chef says.
Sweet Maine shrimp coats a halibut fillet from Iceland, and orange peel elevates the overall taste. Seasonal crushed fava bean and onion confit complement the meat.

The foam on top of the coffee cup was bright yellow, the fragrance intoxicating.
The idea of making a latte with turmeric is a modern twist, but the spice itself is centuries old, a prized commodity on the ancient Silk Road.
It was hearing about the turmeric latte, in fact, that lured me back for a meal at Tribe, the award-winning cafe-style restaurant that launched in Beijing in 2014 with organic food and drink at its core.
I found more change in the wind than the spicy brew I'd come for.
First, expansion has been the word this spring. In the past few weeks, Tribe has opened a third Beijing outlet at Solana mall and its first foray outside the capital, a restaurant in Shanghai that's its biggest eatery yet.
The record, by the Beatles, has been hailed as the world's first art rock, with its album cover one of the most recognizable cover ever produced.
Fans of the Beatles from across the world are expected to gather in Liverpool for the festival which runs from May 25 until June 16, with events taking place across the city.
Former Beatle, Sir Paul McCartney, has given his thumbs up to the festival.
The festival, Sgt Pepper at 50: Heading for Home, will use each track on the iconic album as the creative springboard for 13 brand new events. It will include world premiere commissions, with a mixture of large and intimate events covering art, dance, music, poetry and theater.
A spokeswoman for Liverpool City Council said: "There will be performances, installations, live spectacle and moments of surprise across the city, as the spotlight will fall on Liverpool to celebrate a record which broke the mould and changed music forever."
Conceptually driven by artistic directors Sean Doran and Liam Browne, the festival will see the involvement of international names such as GroupeF (the organisation behind several Olympic and Paralympic closing ceremonies), Mark Morris Dance Group (one of the world's leading dance companies), Judy Chicago (iconic American feminist artist), John Cage (one of the American greats of experimental music), Jeremy Deller (Turner Prize winning conceptual artist), author Frank Cottrell-Boyce, DJ Spooky (American composer) as well some of the very best Indian musicians in the world such as Grammy award winner Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt.
The album was released on June 1, 1967 and spent more than six months at the top of the music charts in Britain, and spent 15 weeks as the number one album in the US. It won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock album to receive this honor.

Da Dong founder Dong Zhenxiang and 13 others have been named "food and beverage culture ambassadors" by the Beijing Food and Beverage Industry Association, a move to promote the capital's culinary industry.
Dong's "super-lean" approach to Peking roast duck was developed to make the traditional duck less greasy and more suitable for modern diners. It lowers the fat content of a roast duck from 42.38 percent to 15.22 percent, according to the restaurant.
Dong's team has also been able to replace the traditional brick oven with electric ovens while maintaining a similar taste and crispness of the duck.
The list of culinary ambassadors also includes Zhao Yuxian, general manager of Bian Yi Fang Group, as the ambassador of Beijing's closed-oven Peking roast duck, Wang Gang, chairman of the board of Meizhou Dongpo Restaurant, as an ambassador of Sichuan cuisine; and Hua Lei, chairman of board of Huajia Yiyuan Restaurant, as an ambassador of new-style Beijing cuisine.

The first Gallery Weekend Beijing, involving top art galleries and institutions in the Chinese capital, began on Friday. It aims to make the city's voice heard in the art world and offer collectors from different countries a platform ahead of the Art Basel fair to be held in Hong Kong from Thursday to Saturday.
Some 14 galleries and four private museums participated in the Beijing event, which was being organized by German artist Thomas Eller. Most of the attendees are from the 798 art zone that houses the city's major galleries and art institutions, including Pace Beijing, Galleria Continua, Ullens Center for Contemporary Art and M. Woods Museum.
The exhibitions, featuring prominent Chinese artists, opened for public viewing on Saturday, with the first day mainly reserved for collectors. Although the main events concluded on Sunday, many of the exhibitions will continue in the coming months.
Eller's Beijing model is based on Berlin's Gallery Weekend, which was established in 2004 in a bid to attract international collectors by creating an intimate alternative to large-scale art fairs.
He talked to many gallery owners in Beijing last year and got their support. The Gallery Weekend Beijing was attended by about 400 collectors, curators and museum directors from home and abroad over the first three days. The event also included lectures by artists, curators and critics held for the public on Saturday.
Jia Wei, co-partner of Boers-Li Gallery and a participant, says it is necessary for members of Beijing's art circle to come together to make such a successful event in the long run.
In November, Shanghai held several art fairs in a short time and brought world attention to contemporary Chinese art.
Art Basel is held in Hong Kong in March every year, and has become an important event for many collectors worldwide.
But for Beijing, a city where most Chinese artists live, the majority of galleries and auction houses have seldom jointly held an influential art event, Jia says.
"We (galleries) used to do the art business separately. It is good and right for all of us to do things together and for the same goal," she says.
Eller says at Gallery Weekend events, collectors can connect better with artists by talking to them after visiting their solo shows.
"At least we have to give collectors a good reason for their decision to visit such events," he adds.

Chinese filmmakers are now seeking to tap the highly developed movie markets of North America and Europe. But what about the countries in China's neighborhood? Are Chinese films doing well there?
The answer is that more needs to be done, according to the annual report on the global influence of Chinese cinema, recently released by the Academy for International Communication of Chinese Culture affiliated with Beijing Normal University.
The report, which was compiled after five months of data collection and analysis, says about 28 percent of those surveyed say they didn't watch any Chinese film in 2016. And 41 percent say they watched five or fewer Chinese films in 2016. Only 6.9 percent of those surveyed say they watched more than 20 Chinese films in 2016.
The study is based on about 1,500 detailed answer forms, sent to filmgoers in 16 countries near China.
One surprising finding was that, though China is part of East Asia, Chinese films have less influence in East Asian countries (like Japan and South Korea), compared with South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central Asia, according to the report's main author Huang Huilin, a professor and the head of the academy.
Japan's viewing average was 1.21 Chinese films a year. South Korea's was 1.8.
"It (the low figures) may be partly because of the similarities between Chinese and other East Asian cultures," says Huang. "Sometimes, different cultures with similar origins can be mutually exclusive.
"However, it also shows that more needs to be done to improve the quality of Chinese films and promotion methods."
East Asia is also less sensitive to the modernity (high-speed trains and WeChat) conveyed via Chinese movies, which Huang attributes to the region's technologically advanced status.
In contrast, Southeast Asia, which has large Chinese communities and is greatly influenced by Hong Kong and Taiwan films, shows a much stronger interest in Chinese movies.
The viewing average for Chinese films in Vietnam was 3.71 in 2016.
The survey also shows that patriotism, emotional connection among family members of different generations and an emphasis on collectivism were three important takeaways from Chinese films for moviegoers in neighboring countries.

MADRID - Chulina, the first female giant panda cub to be born here at Zoo Aquarium, had two special visitors on Wednesday when she went for her first walk outside the pagoda where she has spent her life until now.
She was accompanied on her first trip outside by Queen Sofia of Spain and Lyu Fan, the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China in Madrid.
The event was also commemorated by a band playing traditional Chinese music and a group of local school children, dressed as pandas, who exhibited their paintings of the cub.
Chulina was born on Aug 30, 2016 and made her first public appearance on Jan 12 this year. She is the fifth giant panda cub to be born at the Madrid Zoo thanks to its collaboration with the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.
She was given her name, which means "treasure of the bamboo" in homage to Chulin, who in 1982 became the first giant panda to be born in Madrid after his parents, Shao-Shao and Chang-Chang were given as gifts to Queen Sofia and her husband, King Juan Carlos I, on their visit to China in 1978.
Queen Sofia was enchanted by the giant pandas and became one of the key figures in promoting the giant panda breeding program in Madrid.
Therefore, it was only fitting that she should be Chulina's chaperone for the youngster's first walk outside of the pagoda.
Lyu recently said "Giant pandas are the messengers of China's friendship to the world," and in Chulina, China clearly has one of the friendliest and most attractive messengers of all.
Chinese bike-sharing startup Mobike signed an exclusive strategic partnership with Foxconn Technology Group on Jan 23, in a move to double its annual bicycle production capacity to more than 10 million units.
Under the deal, Foxconn, the world's largest contract consumer electronics maker, will set up production lines for Mobike's bicycles, with an annual production capacity of 5.6 million units. Foxconn has also become a strategic investor in the startup.
Davis Wang, CEO and co-founder of Mobike, said the deal will help the Beijing-based company expand its presence in China and overseas markets.
"The move will lower the manufacturing cost. Foxconn's industrial design capability and overseas footprint will also be of great help," Wang added.
Founded in 2014, Mobike is one of the fastest-growing bike-sharing companies in China, with services available in 13 cities. It is competing with Ofo in the race for control of the nascent bike-on-demand sector.
The deal came shortly after Mobike raised $215 million in a new round of funding in January, led by Tencent Holdings.
James Du, senior vice-president of Foxconn, said the deal is part of the company's efforts to facilitate public transportation with new technology.
BEIJING - Chinese electronics giant Hisense announced on Thursday its status as an official sponsor of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first-ever Chinese consumer electronics brand to sponsor the tournament.
As an official FIFA World Cup sponsor, Hisense will engage in an array of global marketing and advertising activities for both the 2017 Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup, reaching more than 200 countries and regions in the process and greatly enhancing international exposure for the brand.
Hisense will be able to associate its logo with the forthcoming major FIFA events, as well as numerous other rights that include access to advertising boards in stadiums, on-screen credits and other various creative marketing opportunities on-and-off the pitch during the events.
Liu Hongxin, president of Hisense Group, sees the FIFA World Cup as one of the most significant sporting events in the world, rivaled only by the Olympic Games. For Hisense, sponsoring the prestigious tournament not only serves as a massive marketing opportunity for the brand, but also as a crucial, strategic initiative for the entire enterprise.
"Over the years, Hisense has earned a lot of experience and brand growth through sports sponsorships," said Liu in Thursday's joint press conference held with FIFA.
"We are honored to take on our biggest challenge yet with the FIFA 2018 World Cup, and believe it will vastly improve global awareness and economic value for Hisense as a truly international brand. The World Cup brings together the highest level of competition and prestige in football worldwide, making it the perfect platform for us to be a part of," he added.
Additionally, Hisense will offer its technical expertise and products throughout the 2018 FIFA World Cup while also engaging in a joint R&D initiative with FIFA to further push the boundaries of display technology.
FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura said FIFA welcomes the new sponsor with open arms.
"FIFA is delighted to welcome Hisense on board as an official sponsor of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia," she said.
"We look forward to working with them to promote the competition, particularly in China, where the company is a market leader in consumer electronics, and where the popularity of football continues to grow."
FIFA president Gianni Infantino sent his congratulations and expressed his excitement for the partnership.
A large part of Hisense's international strategy has been to actively engage in sports marketing to raise brand awareness. Over the years, Hisense has sponsored major sporting events and team sponsorships like UEFA's Euro 2016, Nascar's XFINITY series, Joe Gibbs Racing, the Australian Open, and Germany's FC Schalke 04.
These activities, coupled with Hisense's innovative high-value products, have helped the brand maintain its status as the No 3 television manufacturer worldwide into 2017.
Consumer electronics maker Hisense Group has become an official sponsor of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, joining a group of Chinese brands in an effort to strengthen their global exposure and awareness.
As an official sponsor, Hisense will engage in various global marketing and advertising activities for both the FIFA Confederations Cup 2017 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
Its logo will be associated with these two upcoming FIFA events and the company will have access to marketing opportunities both on and off the pitch, including advertising boards in stadiums and on-screen credits.
In addition, Hisense televisions will be the official televisions for the competition. It is expected that the partnership will see Hisense reach more than 200 countries and regions and greatly enhance its international brand exposure.
Hisense joins McDonald's Corp and Budweiser in the soccer body's second-highest level of the three-tier sponsorship.
Liu Hongxin, president of Hisense, said: "Over the years, Hisense has gained a lot of experience and seen strong brand growth through sports sponsorships. We believe that the competition will vastly improve global awareness for Hisense as a truly international brand."
Hisense has rapidly expanded its business to more than 130 countries and regions around the world. The company claims that it ranks third overall in all global TV shipments.
Hisense has sponsored major sporting events and teams, including the UEFA Euro 2016, the Australian Open, NASCAR's XFINITY series, Joe Gibbs Racing and Germany's FC Schalke 04.
FIFA signed a partnership in March last year with real estate and media conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, the first Chinese company to sign up as a FIFA partner.
Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd was in discussions to become a top sponsor of FIFA, Bloomberg reported, in May last year.
Adam Zhang, founder of Key-Solution Sports Consultancy, said sport games have played an important role in building internationally recognized brands.
Chinese brands that are exploring overseas markets can gain more exposure and get closer to their global consumers through sponsoring major global sport events, he said.
Sport gives Chinese manufacturers a boost in market
"It's an invasion of Chinese brands," an Indian cricket administrator is reported to have remarked last week after Oppo, a Chinese smartphone maker, shelled out $162 million to sponsor India's national cricket teams for the next five years.


While the comment may have been in jest, it would be a telling reference to Oppo outbidding Vivo, another Chinese phonemaker, thus joining labels such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Star TV and Hyundai, all past sponsors of the teams.
Counterpoint Research said Chinese brands grabbed four of the top five spots in market share in the last quarter of 2016.
The price-sensitive nation of 1.34 billion has an estimated 240 to 300 million smartphone users who bought 120 million units last year, which are estimated to have generated $15 billion to $20 billion in sales revenue.
Its large middle class, estimated at 300 to 400 million, craves internet access via the latest smartphones.
Reports say around 500 million smartphones may be bought in the next few years as the country embraces a cashless economy. The annual sales figure is forecast to reach 240 million units by 2020.
Chinese brands are now itching to eject Samsung from the summit and also battling Indian, South Korean, Japanese and US brands, said Nicole Peng, research director at global consultancy Canalys.
The Chinese offensive began a few years back. Huawei and Gionee sponsored two Indian Premier League cricket franchises. Xiaomi also had smash hits with online flash sales－in which buyers are lured to heavily discounted sales.
In July 2015, Alibaba-backed PayTM, an online payments company, clinched a deal for over $31 million through 2019 to sponsor titles for all official domestic and international cricket matches played in India.
Three months later, Vivo was reported to have spent as much as $23 million to sponsor the Indian Premier League title for just two years, 2016 and 2017. The IPL is the most popular franchise-based cricket tournament in the game's shortest format and commands a global TV and online audience of more than 1 billion.
Next, Chinese brands such as OnePlus, Motorola (owned by Lenovo), LeEco, ZTE and CoolPad joined the gold rush.
Affordable, feature-loaded, nifty Chinese smartphone models materialized in various price bands, from as low as 3,000 rupees to 30,000 rupees ($45.80 to $458).
In an online straw poll conducted by China Daily this month, a majority of Indian consumers agreed with this statement: "Chinese brands have flooded/captured the Indian market."
The reasons for that might be found in a Pew Research report released last week. While smartphone ownership in China jumped 31 percentage points since 2013, in India it has increased by only 6 points, suggesting a great deal of room for future growth.
Signs to that effect emerged last year when India surpassed the United States as the second-largest global smartphone market in terms of users. Smartphone shipments from factories to sellers grew by a healthy 18 percent in India last year, compared with a modest 3 percent globally and 6 percent in China, according to Counterpoint data.
At the same time, global smartphone sales to users grew by just 7 percent last year to 1.5 billion units, according to Gartner Consulting. As sales growth slowed domestically, Chinese vendors saw a "new China" in next-door India.
Xiaomi said it "set a record" by selling more than 1 million smartphones in India from Oct 1 to 18 last year, a festive period comparable to Spring Festival. Its smartphone revenue surpassed $1 billion last year in India, where cricket is "a way of life, a culture, even a religion", in the words of Sky Lee, president of Oppo's India branch.
Even Apple ensured its CEO Tim Cook's attendance at an IPL match last year and received some media coverage, despite the minuscule market share in India of iPhones and iPads, which are considered costly.
Oppo's deal may well prove timely as well. In terms of sales, Oppo grew from 1.2 percent of total market volume in December 2015 to 11.7 percent in January 2017, according to GFK data.
Oppo's logo will now be emblazoned on Indian cricketers' jerseys, promising almost nonstop exposure in print, online, mobile and broadcast media, not only through the end of the contract in March 2022, but thereafter from rebroadcasts.
"Sponsoring cricket is key to gaining mass market popularity and brand recall," said Neil Shah, Counterpoint's research director.
Many phone users in India, reached over the internet, agreed. "For over two years, a retail outlet displayed an Oppo logo, but I never felt it was a big brand. Now, its brand value is going up," said Ajay Anand, a writer in Mysuru.
To appeal to India's highly divergent market－with stark urban-rural, literate-illiterate, male-female and young-old divisions－Chinese brands have adopted multipronged strategies. They include online flash sales, e-commerce tie-ups, an offline push through dealer partnerships, slick advertising campaigns featuring celebrities ($200 million forecast to be spent in 2017), product reviews, social media campaigns and generous retailer margins.
The strategies appear to be working. Ivan Crasto, a sports content strategist in Mumbai, India's commercial capital, said he, his wife and son all own Chinese smartphones.
"Good price, good products. Haven't had any bad experience. They exceeded my expectations. Am more inclined now to buy Chinese brands than Indian or other foreign products," Crasto said.
Rajul Hegde, an entertainment reporter in Mumbai, bought a OnePlus 3T smartphone after noticing it in ads and product reviews. "For its price, it has the best specs. Other foreign brands cost double but didn't match the specs. I'm impressed."
So is S. Saket, a communications professional in Mumbai. He said he bought a Huawei-built Honor Holly phone and Xiaomi Mi5 for their "good finish and premium look", which, he said, other brands don't deliver for the same price.
Arpit Agarwal, a principal of Blume Ventures, an Indian investment firm, said: "Chinese brands were seen as being of inferior quality in the past. But now the perception is changing."
Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Lenovo and Huawei will likely work to strengthen their association with Indian sports even more. Visibility is critical for the success of their multibillion-dollar investments, which include joint ventures for contract assembly plants, warehouses, logistics, call centers and service centers.
But not everyone is applauding. The Xiaomi online user forum includes thousands of comments from disaffected consumers.
A common complaint is that Chinese products are not durable, and after-sales service tends to be poor.
"Chinese make use-and-throw-away products. There is always a glitch in functionality," said S. Dave, a digital strategist in Mumbai.
Puja Lall, a customer relationship manager in New Delhi who owns a Lenovo K3 Note, said: "It's high time Chinese products deliver utility rather than just being very cheap."
K.K. Suresh, a cameraman in Mumbai who owns a Xiaomi Redmi, said, "Chinese brands must offer user manuals in English and regional Indian languages."
Some critics think Chinese brands' Indian forays and rush into cricket may come unglued.
Star TV, Oppo's predecessor as a team sponsor, did not renew its deal citing "volatility" in India's cricket administration, a reference to the sport's legal troubles.
Several years ago, corruption charges and scandals besmirched the IPL, prompting Pepsi to withdraw its sponsorship prematurely.
"There are plenty of Indians who hate cricket because of its excessive commercialization and excessive frequency of matches," said A. Shaikh, a media analyst in Mumbai. "Cricket sponsorship could backfire."
In the coming years, there also may be tough competition from Indian brands that are becoming popular.
Also, if Chinese companies shift their manufacturing from China to India－encouraged by the government's Make-in-India campaign－the perceived corporate "invasion" may well morph into a war among Chinese brands' Indian-made phones, analysts said.

The 10th Ukrainian edition of Chinese Proficiency Competition "Chinese Bridge" for high school students took place here on Wednesday.
The event, which is held in the framework of the Sino-Ukrainian cultural exchanges week, titled "One Belt One Road," was staged in Kiev Gymnasium of Oriental Languages with 11 participants.
The contestants aged between 15 and 17 years old from the Ukrainian capital and the eastern city of Kharkov showed their skills and talents during this year's contest.
The competition was divided into three parts: self-introduction in Chinese, questions and answers about China's history and culture and a talent show. Dmytro Gordeev, a student of Kiev Gymnasium of Oriental Languages, won the competition, charming the public and jury with outstanding Chinese-speaking skills and an art performance on stilts.
"My dream is to study in China. That's why I decided to participate in this competition," Gordeev told Xinhua in Chinese. Gordeev, together with Anastasiya Baydyuk, who came second, will travel to China to represent Ukraine in the finals of the "Chinese Bridge" among high school students.
"I am proud of the chance the God has given us. I am proud of my child, who traveled this path with dignity. I hope that in Beijing she will show all her talents," Larysa Baydyuk, mother of Anastasiya Baydyuk, told Xinhua. The international contest "Chinese Bridge," organized by the Confucius Institute Headquarters in Hanban, China, in 2002, aims to encourage foreign students learning Chinese.
Last year, the Kiev Gymnasium of Oriental Languages received modern educational equipment worth about 226,000 U.S. dollars from the Chinese government to fit out three language-learning classrooms.
 
I mostly travel to small towns and the countryside in China for stories.
I post photos from my trips to social media - a necessity of our profession today. I limit the exercise to four or five images because I believe less is more in an already overloaded space. My images often show hills, valleys, farm animals, rural roads, houses and people. At times, the angle is poor or the light insufficient.
A colleague recently suggested that I add poetic descriptions in photo captions for social media to make them appear less bland. Others have expressed their surprise over my enthusiasm to write about this side of China, which lies in contrast to the country's hectic and glitzy big-city life.
I tell them small towns in China are charming, too. I like the way colorful lights line bridges over waterways. Besides, I prefer the sounds of nature to human chatter. In a test of my nerves in March, I placed myself in the company of thousands of scorpions at a farm in a remote corner of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in the country's south.
I got a glimpse of an industrial program that Guangxi has launched to help its poor villagers. And yes, I made it back to Beijing without getting stung.
While I enjoy rural reporting, I suspect it is no longer the sexiest of beats in any major country.
But with China recently announcing that it is looking to eradicate extreme poverty by 2020, media attention on the countryside will likely be revived. More than 40 million people live below the national poverty line, which is measured at an annual individual income of 2,855 yuan ($414).
It is important to stay with this story, not just for China but also other countries, especially in the developing world, because it is happening at a time of global economic slowdown and the threat to globalization. There could be lessons from the Chinese experience as economists such as Nobel laureate Amartya Sen have pointed out in earlier instances.
Until 2020, the central government is expected to target poverty alleviation in the provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu, where it is most needed. For the effective allocation of resources, the use of big data is handy and would discourage local officials from fudging figures to meet targets, the well-known Chinese scholar Hu Angang told me.
In their paper, China's Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction (1978-2002), he and fellow economists Hu Linlin and Chang Zhixiao wrote that in 1990, the country's poverty population accounted for 29 percent of the global poverty population, and the number dropped to 19.2 percent in 1999.
The country witnessed a slowdown in poverty reduction between 1985 and 1990, they wrote.
But China caught up again in the past decade, pulling large numbers out of poverty.
From this year onward, the country will aim to lift 10 million people on average out of poverty each year. Generally, economists agree that the focus would be on the delivery of drinking water, cable and internet connections, roads and electricity, and technology to support farm produce in impoverished areas. In remote places, the relocation of people would be a key component.

Maria Sharapova will make her return to competitive tennis from a 15-month suspension at an April WTA clay-court tournament in Stuttgart, Germany, it was announced on Tuesday.
The 29-year-old five-time Grand Slam winner was suspended after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.
Her two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation was reduced to 15 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and she will play her first match on April 26 - the day the suspension expires.
Stuttgart has always been a highlight for Sharapova, who has lost just once - to world No 1 Angelique Kerber in 2015 - at the WTA tournament and won the title in 2012, 2013 and 2014.
"I could not be happier to have my first match back on tour at one of my favorite tournaments," said Sharapova, a former world No 1.
"I can't wait to see all my great fans and to be back doing what I love."
WTA CEO and chairman Steve Simon made the official announcement.
"Maria is eligible to return to professional tennis beginning on April 26," said Simon.
"This will be the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart's 40th anniversary and I'm sure the fans there will be excited to see her play."
Sharapova has been given a wild-card invitation to appear in Stuttgart.
"I'm really happy for Maria that she's back after a long break. Particularly pleasing for me is that it's going to be our audience that gets to watch her comeback live," said tournament director Markus Gunthardt.
Sharapova, who will turn 30 on April 19, earned $29.7 million in 2015 as the world's highest paid female athlete.
Banned for life
Meanwhile, Romania's Alexandru-Daniel Carpen has been banned from pro tennis for life after admitting to a match-fixing charge, the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) said on Tuesday.
The TIU found Carpen tried to involve another unnamed player in match-fixing activity in return for payment in October 2013.
Carpen, 30, reached a career-high singles ranking of 1,088 in November 2007 and rose as high as 274 in the doubles ranking in 2015.
PARIS - Spain twice benefited from the use of video technology to defeat France 2-0 on Tuesday, while Sweden rallied from two goals down to beat Portugal 3-2 and spoil Cristiano Ronaldo's homecoming in Madeira.
Antoine Griezmann headed in what appeared to be the opening goal at Stade de France shortly after halftime, but it was ruled offside after consultation with the assistant video referee.
David Silva then converted a penalty after a foul by Laurent Koscielny, and the Spaniards again profited from technology as the referee reversed an offside decision that initially negated Gerard's Deulofeu 78th-minute effort.
"The victory was not a result of the (video) refereeing but due to the excellent work and attitude of my players," said Spain coach Julen Lopetegui.

"The (video) refereeing gave justice to this match, it resolved those two incidents fairly."
Monaco's teenage prodigy Kylian Mbappe made his first France start and had an early chance blocked by goalkeeper David de Gea.
Gerard Pique hooked a Koscielny header off the line, while Andres Iniesta twice went close in the first half before video replays were used for the first time in France.
Griezmann's celebrations after the break were cut short when Layvin Kurzawa was shown to be offside as he set up the Atletico Madrid striker.
The linesman's flag was then raised as Deulofeu tapped in Jordi Alba's left-wing cross, but replays showed the Everton winger, on loan to AC Milan, was marginally behind Samuel Umtiti and the goal was allowed.
"Playing Spain in a friendly is not a fun game, it never has been. But we need this," said France coach Didier Deschamps.
Homecoming
Real Madrid star Ronaldo paraded the European Championship trophy before kick-off at Maritimo Stadium as Portugal played its first match on his home island of Madeira since 2001.
Ronaldo fired the hosts ahead in the 18th minute against Sweden before Andreas Granqvist's own goal doubled the lead for the host.
But Viktor Claesson pulled one back just before Ronaldo was withdrawn on 58 minutes.
Krasnodar midfielder Claesson then equalized before Joao Cancelo turned into his own net in injury time as Sweden crashed the party in dramatic fashion.
"We played pretty well in the first half but we weren't completely serene defensively," said Portugal coach Fernando Santos.
"After the break we didn't play as well and we ended up losing a match we should never have lost."
Meanwhile, the Netherlands slumped to another defeat, losing 2-1 at home to Italy in the country's first game since the dismissal of head coach Danny Blind.
Assistant Fred Grim replaced Blind in the dugout with the Netherlands' World Cup hopes hanging by a thread after Saturday's 2-0 loss in Bulgaria left it fourth in its qualifying group.
The Dutch grabbed a 10th-minute lead in Amsterdam when Italy defender Alessio Romagnoli diverted past 18-year-old Gianluigi Donnarumma - the AC Milan goalkeeper making his first international start.
But Italy hit back immediately through Eder and Leonardo Bonucci converted the winner after turning in the rebound from Marco Parolo's 32nd-minute header.
In Russia, Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke bagged a brace for Belgium in a 3-3 draw with Russia in the same Sochi stadium used for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.
However, Russia marked the occasion of the first soccer match at Fisht Arena with a rousing comeback as the 2018 World Cup host recovered from a 3-1 deficit with goals from Alexei Miranchuk and Alexander Bukharov in the final 15 minutes.
Bristol City defender Hordur Magnusson curled in a first-half freekick as Iceland downed the Republic of Ireland 1-0 in Dublin, while Stoke City's Marko Arnautovic netted for Austria as the host was held to a 1-1 draw with Finland in Innsbruck.

Far-right Le Pen, centrist Macron favorites for second round

PARIS - France voted on Sunday under heavy security in the first round of the most unpredictable presidential election in decades, with the outcome seen as vital for the future of the beleaguered European Union.

Far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron are the favorites to progress to a runoff on May 7 but the result is too close to call in a deeply divided country.

Le Pen, the 48-year-old leader of the National Front, hopes to capitalize on security fears that were catapulted to the fore of the campaign after the fatal shooting of a policeman on Paris's Champs Elysees avenue claimed by the Islamic State group.

Aiming to ride a wave of populism that carried Donald Trump to the White House and led Britain to vote for Brexit, Le Pen wants France to abandon the euro and intends to call a referendum on withdrawing from the EU as well.

Observers predict that a Le Pen victory could be a fatal blow for the EU, already weakened by Britain's vote to leave.

Macron, 39, is seeking to become France's youngest ever president and has campaigned on a strongly pro-EU and pro-business platform.

Seeking to benefit from a worldwide move away from established political parties, the former banker and economy minister formed his own movement, "En Marche" ("On the Move"), that he says is "neither to the left nor to the right".

But polls show scandal-tainted conservative candidate Francois Fillon, a former prime minister, and leftist firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon are also in with a fighting chance of finishing among the top two candidates and reaching the all-important second round.

Four hours after voting stations opened, turnout was up slightly on the figure at the same stage in 2012, suggesting it could beat the final figure of 79.48 percent in that election.

Nearly 47 million people were eligible to vote.

In the wake of the policeman's killing on Thursday, 50,000 police and 7,000 soldiers have been deployed around France to protect voters.

The terror attack was the latest in a bloody series have cost more than 230 lives since 2015.

Guy Belkechout, a 79-year-old pensioner who was voting in the working-class Parisian suburb of Trappes, said he was concerned.

"Security issues have influenced me after the attacks. Candidates who want fewer security measures, who want to reduce the police's powers, have not got my vote," he said.



China United Network Communications says it has partnered with internet giants in a move to arrest its continuing profit decline and speed up its shift toward the mobile internet.
China Unicom, the country's second-biggest telecom carrier, inked a strategic partnership with e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding on Nov 12 to cooperate on basic telecommunication services, mobile internet and industrial internet.
Wang Xiaochu, chairman of China Unicom, said all-round deep cooperation between China Unicom and Alibaba has a solid foundation. Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Alibaba, said he has high expectations for the deal.

China Unicom also signed a strategic cooperative agreement with Baidu Inc on Nov 2 to cooperate on projects in mobile internet, artificial intelligence, big data and telecom services.
Baidu aims to help China Unicom put the services of its brick-and-mortar outlets and franchised stores online. China Unicom will offer Baidu stronger telecom infrastructure support, including internet data centers and information and communication technology.
The cooperation between China Unicom and the internet giants comes after the National Development and Reform Commission selected China Unicom to be part of the first batch of enterprises for the pilot mixed-ownership reform.
Chinese local media recently reported that China Unicom would probably attract private investors to participate in its reform.
"China Unicom has rich network resources, but it has the fewest 4G users compared with its rivals, including China Mobile and China Telecom," says Peter Liu, research director at consultancy Gartner Inc.
"There is an urgent need to find new users and data flow portals," he says.
Liu says cooperation is a positive move, which will see each side benefiting from the other's strengths and enhance China Unicom's core business competitiveness.
Xiang Ligang, CEO of telecom industry website cctime.com, says it is an inevitable trend that internet companies partner with telecom carriers.
"It is expected that this cooperation will boost China Unicom's 4G user base," he says.
Xiang says the mixed ownership reform is a very complex process, involving share purchases and a change of operational modes, and needs time to implement.
Analysts say China Unicom, whose 4G subscribers accounted for 28 percent of China's total at the end of June, is likely to continue to face heavy marketing costs that will weigh on profits.
Its 4G subscribers reached 72.4 million in June, up by more than 46 percent from January. China Mobile had 429 million 4G subscribers in June.

Hong Kong-based developer Far East Consortium International has unveiled plans for a 200 million pound($247.4 million) residential development in Manchester.
FEC will erect four buildings - one with nine floors, a 17-floor block, a 22-level tower and one with 41 floors. Together, they will comprise 754 new homes bordering Manchester's Angel Meadow Park.
Once one of the United Kingdom's most infamous 19th century industrial slums, Angel Meadow has been transformed during the past two decades, and FEC's project promises to rank among the most significant aspects of the area's regeneration.
Gavin Taylor, FEC's regional general manager, said: "Our plans are to build over 700 new homes of mixed tenure across the four plots, while bringing new commercial and leisure uses to street level, and bringing the park itself into the heart of the community."
The high-rises will contain one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments designed by UK-based 5plus Architects. The designs are being shared during a public consultation process that will last until April 7, after which a planning application will be submitted to Manchester City Council. Construction is expected to start at the end of the year, with the first homes due to be finished in 2019.
Jon Matthews, director of 5plus Architects, said: "Angel Meadow Park is a much-cherished amenity and by developing new homes around it, we hope to see the area thrive."
FEC was founded in 1972 by Hong Kong entrepreneur Deacon Chiu. His son David Chiu now chairs the consortium, and his daughter Winnie Chiu is president of hotelier Dorsett Hospitality International, an FEC subsidiary. The Chiu family operates under the so-called "Chinese wallet" strategy, in which developers acquire and improve hotels and real estate in areas that attract large numbers of Chinese tourists and residents. FEC's overseas portfolio includes property in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, the UK wand New Zealand.
Manchester has the third-largest proportion of Chinese residents in the UK, behind Cambridge and London's Tower Hamlets neighborhood, according to the 2011 census.
Sixty-four thousand Chinese tourists visited the north of England in 2015, up from 35,000 in 2014. Direct flights between Beijing and Manchester began last year.
Chinese entities have invested in several infrastructure and real estate projects in Manchester in recent years.


Despite falling from its perch at the top of English and European soccer in recent years, Manchester United is racing ahead of the competition off the pitch, being rated the most influential European club in China.
The 20-time title winner recorded the highest number of followers across combined social media and live-stream platforms in China, according to a new report from Chinese sports marketing firm Mailman.
In its sixth annual Red Card study, conducted between Sept 1, 2016 and Jan 31, 2017, Mailman assessed several online performance indicators for European clubs, including live-stream, website, app and ecommerce data, as well as engagement on Chinese social media platforms Weibo and WeChat.
"We saw a shift in strategy for the world’s best, with many top teams now recognizing China as priority number one outside their domestic markets," said Andrew Collins, CEO of Mailman. "Both Manchester clubs and Borussia Dortmund saw benefits after their China summer tour, and iconic clubs, such as Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, demonstrated their innovation around live-streaming."
Manchester United is the most followed club on Weibo with 8.8 million fans, while Bayern Munich is the most engaged team on the microblogging site. Both clubs' Weibo strategies included locally created stories that used Chinese culture to develop links between fans and clubs, as well as frequent video content.
The report found that, while there was a 50 percent increase in the number of European teams on Weibo, clubs have been slower to take up WeChat, with fewer than half having official accounts. Manchester United has the largest active fan base on WeChat with 700,000 monthly reads.
Jamie Reigle, commercial director at Manchester United, said: "Recent changes in the Chinese digital landscape have enabled a revolution in how we connect and communicate with our fans in the country."
In early 2016, Chinese digital sports media platform Sina Sports secured exclusive rights to broadcast the club’s 24-hour MUTV channel in a multi-year deal.
Live-streaming grew significantly in the Chinese sports market in 2016, with 300 million users accessing more than 200 live-stream platforms. Despite this, fewer than one quarter of European clubs have streamed live online in China. Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham Hotspur were identified as the teams that produced the most successful live-stream content in the country.
In terms of leagues, Germany's Bundesliga has the most comprehensive online presence in China, including live-stream content and a Chinese language website, while the Premier League and La Liga ranked second and third respectively in online performance. Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo was found to be the most influential player online in China, with 11.2 million followers on Weibo and 10 times more engagement than any other player. The four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner made headlines last year when a study found he had more followers on social media than any other athlete in the world.
LONDON — China's Hainan Airlines announced Tuesday it is to operate Boeing 787 Dreamliners on its route between Manchester and Beijing.
Airport officials in Manchester said the Chinese carrier will use its flagship aircraft on the route from May 1.
It follows the announcement last month that Hainan Airlines is to increase the frequency of its flights at Manchester from four per week to five.
The airline's Boeing 787 Dreamliners are fitted with 36 business-class flatbed seats and 177 economy seats.
"With state of the art technology, passengers will benefit from a quieter cabin and should feel more refreshed thanks to the better cabin pressure on board the aircraft," said a statement issued by Manchester Airport.
Loic Gao, general manager for Hainan Airlines in Manchester, said: "We are very excited to see our very first Dreamliner landing at Manchester Airport from the 1st of May. Having announced our increased frequency, it makes perfect sense to operate the Manchester route with our flagship aircraft."
Stephen Turner, commercial director for Manchester Airport, said: "It's great news that Hainan Airlines will be using their flagship aircraft on the Beijing service. Coupled with the news that they will be increasing frequency, it is testament to how successful the route has been performing."
SHEFFIELD, England - China's Ding Junhui moved on to the second round of the World Championship with a 10-5 win over teenage compatriot Zhou Yuelong at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on Tuesday.
Ding, beaten in last year's final as England's Mark Selby thwarted his bid to become the first Asian player to win the title, resumed with a 7-2 overnight lead.
However, 19-year-old Zhou cut the deficit to 7-4 thanks to breaks of 60 and 93 against his hero.
On Monday, Ding rattled off three centuries, including the two highest breaks of the tournament so far - 136 and 132.
However, there were no more triple-digit visits from Ding in the concluding session, with some solid play sufficing, including a break of 68 in the 15th and final frame, to seal the triumph. "I played well in the first session when Zhou was a bit nervous," he told the BBC.
"It was hard for him because he has no experience of playing at the Crucible. But he came back and he will be a lot better next year."
Ding next faces another fellow countryman, Liang Wenbo, after the 30-year-old world No 13 battled past England's Stuart Carrington 10-7.
Carrington, 26, had raced into a 5-2 lead, scoring three centuries. However, Liang fought back to prevail in a scrappy encounter.
Meanwhile, Ronnie O'Sullivan attempted to draw a line under his row with the sport's administrators. Following his win over Gary Wilson on Sunday, five-time world champion O'Sullivan slammed World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn over a disciplinary letter he received for criticizing a referee and swearing at a photographer during his Masters triumph in January.
Snooker's biggest draw, O'Sullivan said he was done with being "bullied" and "intimidated" by officials.
The Englishman's comments, amid familiar threats to retire from the sport, have overshadowed the opening stages of the World Championship. But, as if conscious the situation was getting out of hand, the 41-year-old on Tuesday issued a statement which read: "There has been some speculation and commentary around the answers I gave when questioned by the media on Sunday.
"Any outstanding issues with the snooker authorities will be addressed by my legal team following the conclusion of this great event, when I hope a sensible resolution can be reached."
Englishman O'Sullivan, nicknamed The Rocket, added: "I will not be making any further comment about this during the World Championship. I request the media respect this position in all further interviews. "I wish to focus all my energies on performing to the very best of my ability for the fans in my quest for a sixth world title."
Earlier, four-time world champion John Higgins, speaking after his 10-6 first-round victory over Martin Gould, sympathized with O'Sullivan. "He has a lot on his shoulders in this sport because he is the biggest name - along with Ding, who is the biggest name in the Far East," said Higgins.
"The game would be a lot poorer without him."

US companies can partake in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, but they need to learn more about the transnational trade network, researchers from some Washington think tanks said.
"Before you can change policy, you need to educate people as to what are the opportunities" said David Lampton, director of China studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).
"As a matter of policy, we can support the Asian Development Bank working with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the World Bank working with the AIIB," he said. "But to become active (in the initiative) is a political decision."
On a world map at his SAIS office, Lampton used a marking pen to connect the dots linking Southwest China's Kunming city to major south Asian cities including Singapore, Hanoi and Bangkok to form three bold lines, along which he said mammoth railway projects would be undertaken to enhance connectivity in Asia, which is the signature concept of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Each of these three lines is longer than the Transcontinental Railroad, the line that changed the US," Lampton said. "All these railroads will need equipment, signaling, money and commercial development. Why shouldn't General Electric that builds railroads and signaling do it?"
The Belt and Road Initiative, comprising the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, was first proposed by China in 2013, with the aim of building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes.
Lampton said the Chinese initiative is popular partly because nations neighboring China and beyond find the need to cooperate with China to improve infrastructure and interconnectivity.
The author of Following the Leader Ruling China, From Deng Xiaoping to Xi Jinping said his next book will help the public and US multinational companies discover what he sees as tremendous opportunities arising from connectivity projects.
Last Thursday, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim called the Belt and Road initiative "unprecedented".
"China has been stepping up and illustrating that it's concerned about development, not just in the neighboring countries or even along the Old Silk Road, but globally," Kim said, adding that the World Bank is cooperating well with the AIIB.
Douglas Paal, vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Obama administration "made a huge mistake by taking a negative attitude on the AIIB".
"I welcome the posture taken by China's leadership to open this more to others' participation," Paal said, adding that he expected more concrete plans to come out of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which opens on May 14 in Beijing.
Cheng Li, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, said the forum would help the world know more about China's investment in infrastructure, both regionally and globally.
He said the Belt and Road Initiative is basically a reinvestment in infrastructure and is an active supplement to institutions involved in infrastructure, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
"The Western understanding of the Belt and Road Initiative has just begun," Li said. "Increasingly, the academics, government and particularly business circles in the US will get more interested in the initiative."
David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former US Treasury emissary in Beijing, said that "there are potentially opportunities for the US companies in the initiative; a lot will depend on how China works out all the details of the different financing legalities."

US President Donald Trump, accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence (L), leads a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, US April 29, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]
Saturday marked US President Donald Trump's 100th day in office, and his governance capability, personal charisma and whether he had fulfilled the commitments he made during his campaign received a lot of attention worldwide.




That Trump has successfully focused international attention on his performance during his first 100 days as president is itself a triumph, as he has successfully shifted the attention of the international community to the policy trends of the United States with himself at the helm.
According to some opinion polls in the US, Trump is rated as the worst-performing new president in three decades, but this has not changed his supporters' firm belief in the promises he made on the campaign trail.
By frequently signing executive orders since he was sworn in as president, Trump has also revealed his own personal character traits, and his desire to be seen as vigorous, resolute, swift and straightforward.
Uncertainty had long been viewed as a dominant trait of Trump, but he has been decisive in his dealings with China since entering office, declaring it is not a currency manipulator and adopting policies that are conducive to the smooth and stable development of trade ties between the world's two largest economies, thus avoiding the undesirable repercussions for the global economy that had been widely anticipated.
Despite the existence of numerous uncertainties in relations between the US and China, as well as the US' broader international relations in the Trump era, there are always solutions to any uncertainties and problems if the parties involved work hard to ensure any differences do not spiral out of control. The core task of the better global governance regime that China advocates is to bring global issues, including restive ones, under control and create more benefits for the world.
TISCO's innovation powering space, nuclear programs and boosting exports
If you see Taiyuan Iron and Steel (Group) Co's recently attained capability to make domestic pen-tip steel for ballpoint pens as a sign of an exclusive focus on small things, you will be mistaken. The nation's top maker of stainless steel has decidedly big plans.
For one, TISCO is going global in line with the Belt and Road Initiative. For another, it is strengthening the supply of high-strength and high-end steel available for China's big-ticket projects, such as bullet trains, next-generation nuclear power plants and aerospace programs.
It is now a key cog in the massive manufacturing wheel that powers China's endeavors in industry and science.
As of March, TISCO started to supply stainless steel to Hualong One, the country's domestically developed third-generation reactor, adding one more name to the list of over 10 completed or under construction nuclear power stations that use TISCO-made stainless steel.
TISCO's high-end products also will shine on the global stage through integration with the Belt and Road vision of huge advances in infrastructure and trade, company officials said. TISCO-made materials are used in the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, Temburong Bridge in Brunei, China-Russia and China-Myanmar natural gas pipelines, a nuclear power station in Pakistan and even for the coins cast in Malaysia, the Netherlands, Poland and Brazil.
For China's military forces, TISCO's materials have proved essential in making Dongfeng missile shells and the latest series of destroyers. It is the only qualified Chinese supplier of low-magnetic steel plate for warships and vessels, TISCO officials said in a statement released exclusively to China Daily.
The company's staff has worked hard to achieve technical prowess, particularly in research and development. It has further sharpened its competitive edge through R&D, officials at the Shanxi-headquartered company said.
In 2016, TISCO introduced more than 10 new products, which have garnered a more than 70 percent share of the Chinese market.
Its products have given a major boost to the country's aerospace industry, TISCO said. It made a number of components of the new Long March 7 Y2 rocket, which lifted China's first cargo spacecraft, Tianzhou 1, into orbit on April 20. Tianzhou 1 is the nation's largest and heaviest spacecraft.
The Long March 7 Y2 included TISCO's stainless steel, electromagnetic pure iron, high-strength alloy structural steel and other materials. The company's materials also played a key role in the Long March 7 Y1 rocket, the Y2's predecessor and an important milestone.
According to the SOE's military and nuclear power business department, TISCO's high-end steel and iron have been widely used in China's crucial aerospace programs, including the Shenzhou spaceship series and the Chang'e lunar orbiters. Rocket engines use TISCO stainless steel that is resistant to high temperatures.
"With Tianzhou 1's launch behind us, we're set to supply essential materials for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the world's largest and one of the most critical fusion experiments," the company said in a statement to China Daily.
All the moves would mark TISCO's heightened efforts to expand into the international market, its chairman, Li Xiaobo, said in a written interview.
"We need to move fast to figure out potential demand, and to design the best material for clients," Li told China Daily. "Simply following others isn't going to work. We'll provide optimized solutions to win the (world's) trust."
TISCO's next ambition is to become the world's most competitive stainless steel enterprise, Li said.

TISCO is further fine-tuning its alignment with visionary national campaigns such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Made in China 2025 industrial upgrading plan, and the go-global drive of Chinese enterprises. In doing so, TISCO aims to serve high-end markets as well as burgeoning industries from a global perspective, Li said.
Experts see merit in TISCO's future plans. Belt and Road and the go-global drive will create new, long-term opportunities for iron and steel companies, said Chen Ziqi, deputy director of metallurgical and building materials for China International Engineering Consulting Corp.
Zhao Ying, a researcher at the Institute of Industrial Economics, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said when Chinese firms, particularly SOEs, seek to expand abroad, industrial innovation and long-term investment goals are key to maintaining earnings.
TISCO is allocating 3.5 percent of its annual sales to R&D and innovation, which could mean several billion yuan annually for leading-edge work. This is expected to help TISCO go from a traditional manufacturer to a digital-age global supplier of new products.
"TISCO needs to grab the opportunity presented by supply-side structural reform to expand its product catalog and enhance its competitive edge," Li said.
The company has set a goal to produce 4.5 million metric tons of stainless steel this year, the nation's largest amount. It also intends to top its peers in more than 20 high-end stainless categories, such as steel for aerospace ships and nuclear power reactors.
By the end of 2020, TISCO expects high-end and specialized steel to comprise 90 percent of its total production, with R&D expenses reaching 5 percent of annual sales.
The company said it made a major breakthrough this year by launching its duplex stainless steel products－high-strength steel with lots of chromium－in Europe's high-end materials market.
"In the past, we had to import steel to produce motors for new energy vehicles, which require extremely good quality," said Zhang Wenkang, chief engineer of TISCO's silicon steel mill. "Now, we've independently developed such material that also performs better in energy efficiency."
In 2016, TISCO launched its ballpoint pen-tip steel after spending five years in R&D to develop its own patented technology. It could help end China's long reliance on imported products. Pen-tip steel imports cost $17.3 million a year, the China National Light Industry Council said.
TIANJIN -- Chinese ride-sharing platform Didi Chuxing strengthened government recognition of its business by obtaining its first local online operating license.
The one-stop mobile transportation platform received the Online Car-Hailing Operating License from Tianjin municipality, where DiDi is registered, meaning its online car-hailing service is legal in the city, the company announced Thursday evening.
Tianjin authorities also granted DiDi formal accreditation of its car-hailing services, which is recognized nationwide.
The Ministry of Transport decided last year that car-hailing service operators need formal accreditation of online and off-line operating qualifications.
Other market players such as Shouqi Limousine & Chauffeur and UCAR have also obtained official online operating licenses and accreditation.
DiDi said it will continue to work closely with other localities and expects to see significant acceleration of the overall licensing process.
DiDi offers online car-hailing services in over 400 cities and completes more than 20 million rides daily.
MANILA — China and the Philippines discussed on Tuesday ways to deepen trade and investment relations between the two neighboring countries.
"Both sides agreed on important initiatives geared towards improving overall levels of trade and investment between the two countries," Philippine Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said in a press conference after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.
He said he welcomed China's newly-appointed Ministry of Commerce Minister Zhong Shan who is in Manila on a visit.
The two ministers met on Tuesday during the 28th Philippine-Chinese Joint Commission on Economic and Trade Cooperation (JCETC), the official bilateral mechanism for discussion of trade, investments and economic cooperation.
The JCETC was convened after a five-year hiatus, and serves as a quick follow through of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's state visit to China last October.
The two trade ministers discussed a Six-Year Development Program for Economic and Trade Cooperation that will serve as the overall framework for economic relations from 2017-2022.
It said that both ministers also discussed the list of priority infrastructure projects to be funded by available Chinese credit facility and potential private sector investments from China on oil downstream projects, aviation industry, including aircraft parts manufacturing, waste to energy through gasification, ship building, and ship repair facility and integrated steel facility.
MADRID - Neymar was sent off as Barcelona lost 2-0 at Malaga on Saturday to lose more ground on Real Madrid at the top of La Liga.
Real is now three points clear with a game in hand over Barca despite Antoine Griezmann's classy finish five minutes from time snatching a 1-1 draw for Atletico Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium earlier in the day.
Real can afford to lose to Barca at home in two weeks' time and still have the title race in its own hands.
"No matter what the table is like, Madrid-Barca is always an attractive game, but winning La Liga depends on winning all the points beforehand," said Barca boss Luis Enrique.
"Today we had a very good opportunity and we couldn't take the points."
Neymar picked up the first red card of his Barcelona career for two bookings as the Catalans were left to rue letting Sandro Ramirez join Malaga for free last summer.
Sandro exposed some awful defending from Jeremy Mathieu to sprint clear on goal and slot past Marc-Andre ter Stegen at his near post.
Malaga also had the better chances in a controversy-filled second half, with Juanpi shooting straight at Ter Stegen when clean through.
Neymar was shown his first yellow card for delaying a Malaga freekick while tying his shoelaces, and with 25 minutes left charged into Diego Llorente to see red.
The host then had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside when substitute Adalberto Penaranda finished off a flowing counter-attack.
Barca was also infuriated with referee Gil Manzano when he awarded a freekick on the edge of the box after Sergi Roberto was brought down inside the area.
Malaga finally picked off the 10 men in the final minute when Pablo Fornals squared for Jony to smash home.
Griez lightning
Barca's defeat meant Real's disappointment earlier in the day was short lived.
Pepe's towering header early in the second half of the Madrid derby looked to have Real heading five points clear at the top.
However, Griezmann rounded Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas to net at the near post five minutes from time.
"It is a draw but we've lost two points. Clearly we deserved all three points today," said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.
"We played very well, but we lacked the second goal that would have allowed us to relax."
After a slow start, Real took control of the game as the first half wore on and only two stunning stops prevented Zidane's men from taking a halftime lead.
Firstly, Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak tipped over Karim Benzema's effort after a neat one-two with Cristiano Ronaldo had freed the Frenchman inside the box.
Moments later, Ronaldo couldn't believe his eyes when his fierce strike was turned to safety by Stefan Savic's incredible headed goal-line clearance.
Ronaldo headed just wide after the restart before Oblak rushed from his goal to block Benzema's volley from point-blank range.
The European champion made the breakthrough seven minutes into the second period when Pepe rose highest in a crowded penalty area from Toni Kroos' freekick to power a header into the far corner.
However, Atletico responded to falling behind and should have been level on the hour mark when Yannick Carrasco played in Fernando Torres.
The former Spain international failed to finish, though, as he fired straight at the onrushing Navas.
Navas has faced a barrage of criticism this season, but he made another smart stop to deny Griezmann equalizing with an outrageous overhead-kick attempt.
Griezmann, however, wasn't to be denied when he latched onto an excellent through-ball from Angel Correa with five minutes remaining, coolly firing home at the near post for his 23rd goal of the season.
"We know we are a strong team with an incredible mentality," Griezmann told Spanish TV station Movistar.
"I could see my teammates had confidence, desire and the truth is we played a great game."

FC Barcelona, arguably the world's foremost football club, is set to invest up to "tens of millions of dollars" into a training and experience center on the island province of Hainan, making it the first ever foreign club to have a major direct investment in China's booming football market.
The project, a joint venture with Mission Hills Group, shows the Spanish La Liga side's long-term commitment to China, a club official says. It is also the first of its kind in Barcelona's 118-year history.
Calling the project a "partnership between the strong", Ken Chu, chairman and chief executive officer of MHG, confirms each side will contribute half of the total investment.
"It is a joint investment between our two companies," Chu, who is also a member of China's top political advisory body, told China Daily recently in Beijing.
China's football market has boomed in recent years and is now the biggest in Asia, says Xu Jiayin, controller of Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao FC. The football sector is reported to employ 500,000 to 600,000 people.
Central government plans to have 50,000 soccer-focused schools by 2025 and has also set a goal of 50 million people playing soccer on a daily basis by 2020.
Foreign football clubs are actively involved in China's youth soccer education, with prestigious clubs flocking to the country to open academies and youth training camps in recent years.
Chu says other foreign clubs have tapped into "the world's biggest market", mainly through franchises by permitting Chinese partners to use their brands, but have little investment.
Evergrande, of which Xu is chairman, has invested 1.2 billion yuan ($175 million; 164 million euros; 143 million) to set up a football academy in 2012 in Guangdong in cooperation with Real Madrid CF. Real Madrid will provide football training staff for the school.
Chu says MHGs partnership with Barcelona is not about "inviting foreign trainers" to China, but will "clone" Barcelona's world-class youth training system. MHG will take care of its promotion in China.
The Hainan facility, in the provincial capital Haikou, will be Barcelona's 26th overseas academy, and for the first time the club will dispatch its own technical staff to directly manage it.
"This is our commitment to China and the Chinese people that we are here to stay," says Jenny Yang, project manager of Barcelona's Asia-Pacific headquarters, in Hong Kong.
"Barcelona wishes to establish a lasting presence in China," Yang says.
In addition to a training center, the project will include an experience center to showcase Barcelona's rich history, while providing opportunities for visitors to experience the magic of football using cutting-edge technologies such as virtual reality.
"We are very pleased to see the development of football that China enjoys at the moment and, in a humble way, we wish to add our experience and value. Our primary aim is to help discover and nurture future local football talent, and encourage grassroots interest in this sport," Yang says.

The scenery around Lecheng, a small town 6 kilometers away from the site of the Boao Forum for Asia on tropical Hainan Island, is changing daily as it is turned into an international pilot zone for medical tourism, an industry which is expected to bring in $678 billion in 2017 worldwide.
About 90 kilometers from Haikou, the capital city of Hainan province, Lecheng, with its 700-year history, was chosen in 2013 as the location for a future world-class medical tourism center.
"All the projects in the the Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone, the only one in the country, have been designed to sit in an area of about 20 square kilometers, on both banks of the Wanquan River. This area has been nicknamed China's Amazon and encircles Lecheng island with plush tropical scenery," said Lin Ping, deputy director of the zone's administration office.
Equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and served by a cluster of high-end medical professionals, the zone will cater to patients from around the country and overseas, Lin said.
More than 483,000 Chinese went abroad for overseas healthcare and leisure, health checkups and other medical services in 2015.
To support development of the pilot zone, the central government has offered a number of preferential policies under which foreign companies will be able to set up medical organizations in the zone and foreign doctors will be allowed to practice there for up to three years.
"A total of 27 projects have been completed or are under construction, attracting an investment of 22.8 billion yuan ($3.3 billion). The main businesses of these projects involve treatment of tumors, plastic surgery, anti-aging services, leading-edge medical technology research, such as stem cells, health management and rehabilitation," said Lin.
He said another 36 projects have passed medical technology appraisals and in total the administration office has talked with developers of 92 high-end medical and healthcare projects, with a potential total investment of 60 billion yuan.
"When all the projects are completed in about five years, the pilot zone will be able to receive 5 million tourists a year. Output value of the services will amount to 80 to 100 billion yuan," said Lin.
Geng Songtao, a professor of tourism with Haikou-based Hainan University, believes that the pilot zone has many advantages that will help with the development of its medical tourism industry. He suggested that the zone makes good use of the preferential policies and produces an exquisite top-down design for the zone's development.
Hainan, once a key stop on the ancient Maritime Silk Road and now building itself into an international tourism destination, plans to be an all-in-one international demonstration zone for Chinese traditional medicine tourism by 2020.

CEO of medical device maker Medtronic is ready to embrace opportunities under government plan
As China increases efforts to provide low-cost and effective medical services through the government's healthcare reforms, the plan offers potential for all market players, including foreign companies.
Omar Ishrak, chief executive of medical device manufacturer Medtronic, does not regard the reforms as something that would put the brakes on the company's long-term commitment in the country.
He sees them as central in allowing his company to fulfill its mission to expand access to healthcare and lower costs in healthcare systems globally.
Ishrak has long been fascinated with Chinese culture. He joined the company in 2011 and comes to China at least twice each year.
Leading a company with more than 88,000 employees in 160 countries, Ishrak has created a healthy work/life balance.
His easygoing nature has been welcomed by employees.
In 2016, he was named in Glassdoor's top 50 chief executive list for the second year.
Recently, he spoke to China Daily during the Boao Forum for Asia about his company's plans to embrace opportunities brought by the government's medical reforms. The following are edited excerpts from the interview:
What do you think gives your products the competitive edge in the medical device market in China?
In the medical device market in China, we have the leading market share. For our latest product in China - the heart valve - we have solid experience that we are proud to bring to China. I think our competitive edge lies in our understanding the needs of local physicians so that we can customize products to meet their demands.
The China-led Belt and Road Initiative has opened up new business opportunities. How will it benefit your business?
With clearer policies and regulations to be established in time, the initiative may make it easier for us to do business, providing greater access to products and to professional training in neighboring countries.
What do the healthcare reforms mean for your company?
The government's aim of lowering healthcare costs in China is a good cause. As a medical manufacturer, the company has helped increase Chinese patients' access to healthcare through innovative public and private partnerships, and we have a plan to establish a training and education center in Chengdu in Sichuan province to help medical professionals from western China to improve their clinical skills.
Future efforts would involve helping improve healthcare quality in remote China, expanding sales and distribution networks to reach more people in need in those hard-to-reach rural regions.
The company is opening the first bio-prosthetic heart valve manufacturing site in Shanghai. It is expected that in time this facility will help relieve the shortage of bio-prosthetic valves in China and globally.
There are many patients in China who cannot afford high-quality products. Do you think the government has a role to play to make medical products more affordable? What is your suggestion for improving healthcare in China?
China still lags behind compared to developed countries in terms of government spending on basic healthcare. I am not saying that China should increase the spending right away, but it is a fact. The percentage of people who can have access to basic healthcare in China is lower than developed countries. The costs of healthcare remain high compared to other developed nations. The US spends 15 percent of its GDP on healthcare, but China spends less than 5 percent. There is room for improvement, but the government is on the right track.
How do you meet the demand of customers who cannot afford high-quality medical products? How do you make your products more affordable?
The major problem in China is not high costs. The major problem is that even if there are many people who can afford the products, they do not have access, possibly because they live too far from the clinics.
The first step to address the problem is to try to provide access to everyone who can afford the products. Because the demand is huge in China, and a huge volume itself decreases costs naturally. We would be able to produce more low-cost products in China in the future, but we would have stratified portfolios. It depends on how demand for different kinds of products changes.
What is unique about the Chinese market compared with your other international markets?
There are more patients and more physicians in China compared to any other area in the world. In 10 years, probably, the Chinese market will have outpaced the US market. To us, what makes China unique is that the Chinese government has a systematic approach to resolving the huge demand for better healthcare through controlling the pace of investment and by improving the training of medical professionals. In this way costs are controlled. The Chinese government has been leveling the playing field for market players, which makes China a long-term viable market.
Your company received a fine of 118.5 million yuan ($17 million; 16 million euros; ￡13.5 million) from the National Development and Reform Commission for refusing to let distributors discount prices for medical devices last year. How has this affected your business and strategies?
We have spoken to officials with the National Development and Reform Commission. By and large, there has not been much effect on our business.
We have the best intentions and we have made adjustments accordingly. The government is keeping an eye on the whole supply chain and is trying to streamline it. That helps improve the whole business environment and we will watch it carefully. The transparency of law enforcement is good enough and I don't think there is too much to complain about from the company's perspective. We now understand where the regulations stand and we will make sure employees understand the rules.
What's your opinion about free trade and globalization?
Healthcare is a global need. If you can help people, no matter where they are in the world, it is a good thing. The demand is universal and I think there should not be too much disagreement on this point. Putting a barrier on doing this sometimes makes it more difficult but may be unintentional. We would adapt to local policies. Once the rules are in place, we are a big enough company to make the adjustment.
Have you visited any Chinese hospitals or clinics and spoken with local distributors and patients?
Yes, I have visited both small and large hospitals in China, and the medical center in Chengdu in Sichuan province. The feedback from the patients is usually good. I have met distributors as well. I will come back to Beijing again this year.
What's your hobby? How do you spend your time after work?
I go hiking a little bit while visiting countries. I love running, just for fun. I hope I can have the chance to hike in China very soon.

PARIS - Fourth seed Zhang Jike retained his men's singles title at the World Table Tennis Championships by beating third seed Wang Hao in an all-Chinese final here on Monday.
Zhang's win was a repeat of the final at the 2011 Rotterdam World Championships and the 2012 London Olympic Games, where he defeated Wang to become the first men's singles world champion to win Olympic men's singles gold medal.
He beat the 30-year-old Wang 11-7, 11-8, 6-11, 14-12, 5-11, 11-7 to keep an unbeaten record against the veteran penholder in the four years' major international competitions.
Wang, the world champion in 2009 and a three-time Olympic singles silver medalist, trailed Zhang 2-0 but managed to make it 2-1 after the thirds set.

He pulled ahead in the fourth but Zhang, who plays shake-hand attacking top spin, held his nerve and won 14-12.
Wang, also a four-time World Cup winner, took the fifth set 11-5 and pulled it to two sets against three. But Zhang laughed to the last and grabbed the next 11-7 and a second world title.
Zhang threw his shirt to the crowd and ran up to the stand to celebrate the victory with his parents.
"Since I have already won a Grand Slam of Olympic Games, World Championships and World Cup, I did not feel nervous during the match. I just want to enjoy the match," Zhang said.
"I beat Wang Hao maybe because I am younger than him. But I don't think there is loser. Both of us were relaxed during the match."
He added, "My parents had always wanted to watch me play during major world compeititions, but I refused. This time I asked them to come here."
Wang said that he was not disappointed despite the loss. "This is my last world championships," he said. "I just want to enjoy the match."

PARIS - Zhang Jike launched his title defense in style by beating Sweden's Fabian Akerstrom in straight sets at the World Table Tennis Championships here on Wednesday.
Zhang, also the gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, took the easy win 11-5, 11-1, 12-10, 11-7 over the 321st-ranked opponent.
His Chinese teammate Ma Lin, the Olympic champion in 2008, also advanced after eliminating local player Christophe Legout without conceding a game.
The other two Chinese stars Wang Hao and Xu Xin both reached the second round with straight-set victories.
Top seed Xu defeated Steffen Mengel of Germany while Wang, whom Zhang beat in the Olympic final in London, trounced Marcos Madrid of Mexico.

The 25-year-old, a grand slam winner of world championships, World Cup and Olympic Games, said: "I am feeling no pressure now and I have been well prepared. I can't wait for my first match."
Zhang said he is very familiar with Paris and he likes the city very much.
"I won my first World Cup two years ago here, so I think Paris is my lucky place. I also like the fans here. I was very surprised to find two years ago that they loved the sport very much," Zhang said.
Zhang won the men's singles title at the Rotterdam world championships in 2011 but was mistakenly awarded the women's trophy.
"I just hope that I can get the right trophy if I win," he joked.
Visitors enjoy blooming sakura in Wuhan University in Hubei province. [Photo by Zhou Guoqiang/China Daily]




Every day at this time of year, more than 15,000 people flood into Wuhan University of Central China's Hubei province, eager to enjoy the bountiful cherry blossoms during the country's short and enchanting spring.
The university used to get more than 100,000 visitors a day when the cherry trees on the campus bloom, but that overwhelming traffic has been limited: now, only 15,000 visitors are allowed to enter the campus each day after registration.
Sakura, or cherry blossom, is the national flower of Japan. China's cultivation of cherry blossom dates back to the Qin (221-206 BC) and Han (206 BC-220 AD) dynasties.
The cherry blossom is only one of the many kinds of flowers that Wuhan offers in the whole year. Visitors from across the country come to Wuhan to appreciate its peonies, azaleas and peach blossoms.
The number of visitors to Wuhan increased rapidly with the establishment of the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway in 2009. In 2013, the city named itself "new flower city" and has invited tourists to enjoy its flowers.
There are 20 flower-appreciating routes in 18 flower-themed parks for tourists this year, including those planted with hundreds of thousands of tulips, sunflowers and lavender.
Cao Dongfa, an officer of the city's Flower Appreciation Office, which was established in 2012, said more than 30 million visitors will be expected to visit Wuhan in 2020.
"By 2020, the income of Wuhan's tourism industry will reach 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion)," Cao said. "We've done plenty of work to provide the best view and service to visitors."
He said that the city has experienced traffic jams, a hotel shortage and many complaints from both locals and visitors with the booming of tourism. The government realized that change was essential for tourism to continue to develop. It has hence approved construction of more hotels and roads, and trained more tour guides.
Even industrial parks of Wuhan have been filled with flowering trees.
Cao Zeyun, president of Goodnight Furniture, said the company has planted more than 56 kinds of cherry trees in its industrial park.
"We now have more than 1,000 cherry trees that cater to droves of visitors," Cao said. "We also have imported flower trees from European countries and North America to make sure that flowers bloom the whole year in the park."
Like many other industrial parks, the furniture park is open to visitors for free.

China's top education authority signed memorandums of understanding in Beijing on Tuesday with several provinces and regions of the country to facilitate their educational cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road Initiative.
The signing ceremony is one of the efforts by the Ministry of Education to prepare for the upcoming Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which will be held in Beijing on May 14 and 15.
Upon signing the MOUs, officials from Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces, Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Qingdao, a city in Shandong province, promised to fully use their educational resources to serve the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
They also expressed their determination to contribute to the establishment of an educational community in participating countries through in-depth exchanges and cooperation and nurturing talent.
To boost China's educational cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road, the ministry issued a plan in July, and since September has signed MOUs with several provinces, regions and cities involved in the initiative.
According to the MOUs, the ministry will offer participants support in their student exchanges, setting up educational institutions and conducting regional research.
Global advertising tycoon sees initiative as key to 'the next billion middle-class consumers'
NEW YORK - China's Belt and Road Initiative and other similar efforts are really important for the future growth of multinationals and their clients, the CEO of a leading global advertising company told Xinhua in a recent interview.
"The next billion middle-class consumers are not going to come from the United States or Western Europe. They're going to come from Asia, from Latin America, from Africa, the Middle East and from South, Central and Eastern Europe," said Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, the London-based multinational advertising and public relations company.
"So, initiatives like the Belt and Road are really important for our company and our clients," he added.
The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by China in 2013, aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient Silk Road trade routes and promote common development among all countries and regions involved.
For the advertising and marketing services industry, the dominant growth engines in 2017 are United States and China, said Sorrell, adding that China, including Hong Kong, is WPP's third-largest market, accounting for about $1.6 billion of revenues out of the $26 billion in total and 14,000 workers out of about 200,000.
"Growth has plateaued in the last two to three years and 2017 looks like another year of modest growth in comparison to the growth that we've seen in previous years going back beyond 2015 to earlier times. However, we remain unabashed bullish on China and the Chinese economy," he said, describing the Chinese market as "a really important part of our company."
Meanwhile, he noted that the United States remains the biggest economy in the world and WPP's largest market, accounting for about $6.5 billion of the group's 2016 revenues.
"America will always be important in our strategy whether it's Buy America First, Buy America or Hire America, but the other markets of the world, particularly post-Brexit, are becoming even more important, too," he said.
"So, our focus remains on Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe, which is already one-third of our business. We want them to be 45 percent," he added.
Sorrell said he hopes Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump will establish a strong relationship and the two largest economies in the world will strengthen rather than weaken their ties.
Should there be a trade war between the US and China, it would "not be helpful, to say the least," he warned.

Gifted Gabonese continues hot streak as Borussia buries Benfica
DORTMUND, Germany - Coach Thomas Tuchel hailed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 'sensational' hat-trick after Borussia Dortmund's 4-0 romp at home to Benfica saw the Germans steamroll their way into the Champions League quarterfinals.
Aubameyang has now scored seven times in his past three games and has seven Champions League goals in as many matches this season.
The result saw Dortmund win 4-1 on aggregate after its 1-0 loss in Lisbon last month.
"It was a sensational performance," enthused Tuchel.
"I love goals like his first one, because they need such good timing and Auba is always where he needs to be."
Aubameyang's first Champions League hat-trick was redemption after a night to forget in the first leg, when he missed four chances - including a second-half penalty.
"We saw the real Aubameyang tonight as opposed to the first leg, when I think his twin brother played," quipped Tuchel.
"This was the perfect time for Auba to get his hat-trick.
"For a scorer, there is nothing more important than to score - and he has a nose for the goal."
Gabon international Aubameyang has 28 goals for the season as Dortmund reached the last eight in Europe for the first time since 2014.
He took the man-of-the-match award, but US international Christian Pulisic, who only turns 19 in September, was also outstanding.
Pulisic set up Aubameyang's opening goal with just four minutes gone, then netted the crucial second in the 59th minute to put Dortmund ahead in the tie.
Aubameyang added the third two minutes later.
"Christian is a very self-confident person and he can draw on his potential on moments like tonight," said Tuchel.
"Along with the rest of the team, he put in an exceptional second-half performance."
After Dortmund canceled out Kostas Mitroglou's first-leg goal early, Tuchel said his side lost its way after 25 minutes.
"But the second half was a top performance," he added. "If I say I expected this result it would mean that we have a lack of respect for Benfica.
"Benfica is a great, proud club and we have huge respect for them. But we played two great games and I think we deserve to go through."
The defeat ensured more German pain for Benfica, which has now lost 15 times in 23 European games away to Bundesliga clubs.
"We played well up until the point when the opponent scored two goals in quick succession," said Benfica coach Rui Vitoria.
"We didn't start well, conceding a goal after only four minutes, but then we found our way.
"We had a few goal chances in the second half, but we didn't use them and we didn't react once they got their quick goals.
"We can't say everything was bad. The result was bad, but we played well enough in places and we had our chances.
"We did all we could to reach the next round, we fought, but it wasn't enough and of course, we're sad after the result."
Tuchel said he had no preference who his side plays in the last eight.
However, he admitted the euphoria of Dortmund's victory turned into disbelief in the dressing room when the players gathered to watch the closing stages of Barcelona's stunning 6-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain to advance 6-5 on aggregate.
"We watched the last two minutes of the (Barcelona-PSG) game, thinking we were the sensational news of the round. But that clearly wasn't to be," Tuchel said with a smile.

Archaeologists have found 13 tombs, which are estimated to be between 1,800 and 2,700 years old, in Bomi county of Southwest China's Tibet autonomous region.
The tombs were discovered by construction workers during a road project in Qundo township, Nyingchi, in the second half of 2016, according to the regional institute of cultural relics.
Two relatively complete human skeletons were found in two tombs, while human bones were also discovered in other graves, said Shaka Wangdu, associate researcher with the institute.
Archaeologists found that the tombs appeared to follow a known burial custom, which is still seen in parts of Qundo. According to the custom, after the body has decayed, the bones are exhumed and reburied.
Objects including eight complete examples of pottery, a millstone, three bronze arrowheads and iron residue were also found.
"The tombs will help research into Tibetan funeral customs and human development in eastern Tibet in a period without written records," said Shaka Wangdu.




 
The Dalai Lama's actions won't change Beijing's position on Tibet-related issues and the boundary question, a Foreign Ministry official said on Wednesday, after India invited the Dalai Lama to visit the disputed eastern section of the China-India boundary despite China's concerns.
The Dalai Lama's behavior, like claiming to be a "son of India" and endorsing false statements by the so-called Arunachal Pradesh officials in disputed areas in Southern Tibet, indicate that the Dalai Lama clique's position is thoroughly "foreign", said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang.
Lu made the remarks when asked to comment on the Dalai Lama's attack on the Chinese government during his stay in the disputed region, as well as Indian officials' repeated, inappropriate speeches over the boundary question.
China strongly objected to India over the visit, and Lu said China will "take further measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and national security".
"The 14th Dalai Lama's show won't change China's position one bit on the boundary question and Tibet-related issues," Lu said. On the contrary, it will only make people see more clearly the Dalai Lama's true intention to split China and undermine the interests of its people, including the Tibetan ethnic group, all under the cover "of religion", Lu added.
The spokesman also slammed India's insistence on inviting the Dalai Lama to the disputed region and "indulging" him, as well as Indian officials making provocative political speeches.
This shows that the Dalai Lama's trip goes beyond what India claimed to be "religious activities", Lu said. It also shows that India had violated the "solemn commitment" it made over Tibet-related issues, and its behavior will adversely affect the two countries' efforts to solve territorial disputes through negotiations, he added.
"The boundary question and Tibet-related issues bear on the political foundation of China-India relations," Lu said, urging India to stop "provocative moves".
Jia Duqiang, a researcher at the National Institute of International Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said India "will gain nothing from the move", which will damage its ties with Beijing.
"China will not make any concessions when it comes to its core interests, sovereignty and Tibet-related issues", he said.
Jia said to repair ties, India must give assurances that such incidents will not happen again.

The annual sales of healthcare products could reach 200 billion yuan ($29 billion) in China, more than half of which are expected to be purchased by senior citizens, according to a report by China Central Television. The Mirror commented on Wednesday:
Purchasing healthcare products is a part of life for elderly people, but the pain is being felt by their loved ones who often fail to convince them that many of the much-touted "healthcare programs" are nothing but scams.
Earlier this month a senior citizen in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province, jumped into the sea to end his life after being swindled out of nearly 100,000 yuan by the salespersons of healthcare products during the past four years.
That many elderly fall for primitive sales tricks has a lot to do with their yearning for consolation and company in the absence of their children. The salespersons will target old couples living alone by visiting them frequently with small gifts and inviting them to health "seminars", where they are invariably lured into buying healthcare products.
To keep them on the hook their illnesses will be exaggerated by so-called medical experts. It is almost impossible for these aged customers to step back once they make the first payment.
However, their children should not take all the blame for this situation. Most victimized seniors are individuals capable of making their own decisions, and they tend to turn a blind eye to their children's suggestions or warnings and even keep their "investment" in healthcare to themselves until their money runs out.
The real issue is in the unregulated, deceitful promotion of healthcare products. Efforts have been made to guarantee the quality and authenticity of these products, yet what many salespersons do goes beyond promotion. In some cases it is just fraud.

Beijing launched its medical reform on Saturday, scrapping the previous markup on drugs, which could be as high as 15 percent in the old pricing system, and replacing the registration fee and treatment fee with a medical service charge.
The implementation of the capital's reform measures marks a substantial step toward long-anticipated reform of the country's long-controversial medical system.
Any reform always necessitates adjustments among the interests of different groups. And, according to media reports, some patients have applauded the considerable decline in medicine prices, believing the separation of medical services from medicine prices will bring tangible benefits to people, while others have complained about the higher medical service charge, claiming it a disguised price increase. The capital's hospitals have also shown mixed reactions to the cancellation of drug price markup.
Given that any substantial reform of the country's medical system affects a variety of groups, it is normal for the reforms to be received differently by different groups. But the established medical system was under fierce public criticism and a basic consensus was reached that the past practice of doctors' incomes being dependent on medicine sales to a certain extent should be abolished and they should be paid according to the quality of service they provide. Beijing's move to lower medicine prices and the cost of tests involving medical equipment will surely motivate doctors to improve the services they provide as they will no longer profit as much from prescribing tests and medicines.
The raised medical service charge will better reflect the value of the skills and experience of medical personnel and also promote much-needed hierarchical diagnosis and treatment, thus easing the insufficiency of medical facilities and personnel in big hospitals and improving the sometimes-strained doctor-patient relations.
Beijing's latest move offers a correct direction for the broader medical reform and it is hoped that more regions will follow suit.




Company says $1b plant will be built in stages, starting with a smaller facility
The Chinese-funded luxury electric car startup Faraday Future said on Feb 3 that it remains committed to its planned $1 billion plant in Nevada in the United States, but will build the factory in phases and start with a much smaller facility.
Faraday, an affiliate of Beijing-based internet major LeEco, said in a statement to China Daily that it is adopting a multi-stage manufacturing strategy for its 27.87-hectare auto plant.
Qiong Liu, city manager of North Las Vegas, said on Feb 2 that Faraday will build a 6.04-hectare facility later this year. "I don't think they are downsizing, but instead they will construct the plant in phases," Liu said.
According to Liu, Faraday is completing engineering work on the factory and aims to have the shell of the building ready by the end of August and the rest of the building done by the end of October.
Faraday expects to start testing a vehicle later this year and to "start production in 2018", she added.
Faraday said it is scheduled to start constructing the second stage of the plant later this year. A cash crunch at LeEco and Faraday's missed payments to a contractor working on the factory last year spurred skepticism about the company. In November, Nevada State Treasurer Dan Schwartz expressed concerns about Faraday's ability to complete the project.
In 2015, Nevada lawmakers approved an incentive package valued at about $215 million for the plant. Liu said the incentives are structured so that they won't be paid out until and unless the company meets certain requirements.
Faraday unveiled its first production vehicle, called the FF91, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.
Eric Paul Dennis of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says that Faraday is becoming more realistic about what it can accomplish. "Their initial plans to build a mega-factory and introduce multiple models on a short timetable were very risky and probably impossible," he says.
"Their recent restructuring makes me think they are beginning to mature as a company. Starting small, focusing on quality and responding to the market reception of one or two models is a better approach to establishing a viable auto operation," Dennis says.

Internet major LeEco said on Friday it has raised 16.8 billion yuan ($2.4 billion) in funding led by Sunac China Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed real property developer, in a move to head off its financial woes, according to caixin media.
The deal, announced in a filing to Shenzhen Stock Exchange, is expected to temporarily solve LeEco's cash crunch and help Sunac find new revenue sources, analysts said.
Sunac will spend 6 billion yuan to buy 8.61 percent shares of Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp, the listed arm of LeEco. Once the deal is completed, Sunac will become the second biggest shareholder of Leshi.
The Shenzhen-based real estate firm will also spend 7.95 billion yuan on 33.5 percent shares of Leshi Zhixin Electronic Technology, the smart TV unit of LeEco and 1 billion yuan on 15 percent of the shares of Le Vision Pictures.
LeEco has been facing mounting doubts from investors since November, after its co-founder and CEO Jia Yueting admitted in a public letter that the company was suffering from a cash crunch due to over-expansion.
Lu Zhenwang, CEO of the Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy, said the deal offered a short-term solution to LeEco's capital shortage.
"It makes sense for Sunac to pour money into LeEco's listed arm and TV unit, which are profitable businesses and the latter's core assets.
"The deal can help Sunac branch into the promising internet sector, which can offer new revenue sources," Lu said. "But LeEco's cash-burning electric car offshoot is still in dire need of money," he added.
Founded in 2004, LeEco started as a video-streaming service in the mold of Netflix Inc and diversified into the automobile sector in 2014.
Shen Meng, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank, said the deal was more like LeEco borrowing money from Sunac rather than an investment.

FC Barcelona, arguably the world's foremost soccer club, is set to invest up to "tens of millions of dollars" into a soccer training and experience center on the island province of Hainan, making it the first ever foreign club to have a major direct investment in the China's booming soccer market.
The project, a joint venture with Mission Hills Group, shows the Spanish La Liga side's long-term "commitment" to China, a club official said. It is also the first of its kind in Barcelona's 118-year history.
Calling the project a "partnership between the strong", Ken Chu, chairman and chief executive officer of MHG, confirmed each side would contribute half of the total investment.
"It is a joint investment between our two companies," Chu, who is also a member of China's top political advisory body, told China Daily last week in Beijing.
China's soccer market has boomed in recent years and is now the biggest in Asia, said Xu Jiayin, controller of Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao FC. The soccer sector is reported to employ 500,000 to 600,000 people.
The central government plans to have 50,000 soccer-focused schools by 2025 and has also set a goal of 50 million people playing soccer on a daily basis by 2020.
Foreign soccer clubs are actively involved in China's youth soccer education, with prestigious foreign clubs flocking to the country to open academies and youth training camps in recent years.
Chu said other foreign clubs have tapped into "the world's biggest market" mainly through franchises by permitting Chinese partners to use their brands, but have little investment.
Evergrande, of which Xu is the chairman, has invested 1.2 billion yuan ($175 million) to set up a soccer academy in 2012 in Guangdong in cooperation with Real Madrid CF. Real Madrid will provide soccer trainers for the school.
Chu said MHG's partnership with Barcelona is not about "inviting foreign trainers" to China, but will "clone" Barcelona's world-class youth training system. MHG will take care of its promotion in China.
The Hainan facility, in the provincial capital Haikou, will be Barcelona's 26th overseas academy, and for the first time the club will dispatch its own technical staff to directly manage it.
"This is our commitment to China and the Chinese people that we are 'here to stay'," said Jenny Yang, project manager of Barcelona's Asia-Pacific headquarters, in Hong Kong.
"Barcelona wishes to establish a lasting presence in China", Yang said.
In addition to a training center, the project will include an experience center to showcase Barcelona's rich history, while providing opportunities for visitors to experience the magic of football using cutting-edge technologies such as virtual reality.
"We are very pleased to see the development of soccer that China enjoys at the moment, and in a humble way, we wish to add our experience and value. Our primary aim is to help discover and nurture future local football talent, and encourages grassroots interest in this sport," Yang said.
KATHMANDU - A Chinese tourist died of high altitude sickness in Nepal's Solukhumbu district along the Everest region on Sunday, police confirmed.
The Chinese embassy in Nepal has also confirmed the death of the tourist.
The 51-year-old Chinese national breathed his last in Gorak Shep located at 5,164 meters above sea level. He was trekking towards Qomolangma base camp with three other compatriots and a local porter guide.
Inspector Pradhumna Adhikari based in the district told Xinhua over phone that "A Chinese tourist was rescued from Gorak Shep through helicopter on Sunday morning. He was taken to Pasang Lhamu hospital in Lukla after he complained of altitude symptoms but he died on the way."
The hospital confirmed that the reason of his death is high altitude sickness.
Pasang Sherpa, an administrative officer in the hospital, told Xinhua that they received the Chinese tourist at 7:30 a.m. (local time) but he was already dead.
According to Tourist Police Office Lukla, the Chinese tourist started trekking on Jan. 23 from Lukla, the gateway to world's highest peak Qomolangma.
After the incident on Sunday morning, the team members have however continued their trek to base camp located at an altitude of 5,364 meters.
Although the dry winter is not a suitable time for trekking in the Everest region, few foreign tourists prefer solo trekking in this season, according to the Department of Tourism.
The Chinese national was also trekking in the region without the support of any official trekking agencies.
More than 10,000 foreign trekkers visit the Everest region annually for trekking and mountaineering, mostly from China, the United States, Britain, Canada, Japan and France.

Donald Trump has been known to do it in the middle of the night. Kim Kardashian has done it more than 22,000 times. Many people don't understand why you would want to do it at all.
We're talking about tweeting and, unlike posting your entire life on Facebook, this social media activity demands a particular set of skills.
Why use Twitter? It's a way to have a one-on-one virtual connection with your heroes and anybody who interests you. Likewise, you can share your life and views with an almost limitless number of people. And it all has to be done within the tantalising limit of 140 characters of text – plus photos, videos and links – which really helps you focus your mind.
Katy Perry has the most Twitter followers, with 95.6 million of the micro-blogging site's 317 million monthly active users. Justin Bieber isn't far behind with 91.5 million, followed by Barack Obama and Taylor Swift with around 83 million each. The heaviest hitters of Twitter are pop stars, heroes of sport and other celebrities. But you don't need to be famous to create a buzz with the right tweets at the right time.
In fact, Katy Perry is a great example of how to do it well. She has a bubbly tweeting style that mashes up chat about her tours and her music, insights into her emotional roller coaster over the US election, and playful titbits about her daily life. "Done with my Christmas shopping", she tweeted, and posted a link to her Instagram page that featured crazy gadgets like a "pet emergency evacuation jacket" and a "chocolate donut camera".
To get started on Twitter, pick a simple, memorable user name like @KatyPerry, post a short profile and choose a photo. Some tips: avoid punctuation such as underscores in your name, post your own photo (not a photo of your dog, it's not Facebook) and don't be an "egg person" – referring to the default egg-shaped image when a user hasn't posted their own picture. It's the ultimate Twitter fail, and won't get you any followers or respect.
Then, it's time to start tweeting by sending your updates ("what's happening?") and following people. Building up an army of followers can take time. Generally, the more people you follow and the more you tweet, the more followers you'll get. To become a Twitter star, you need to carve out a reputation for posting original, eye-catching tweets on trending topics – and maximise your visibility by mastering the use of hashtags.
Twitter Analytics will show you how your tweets are performing and who is following you – right down to their age category, country, income bracket, gender and interests. If your popularity is flagging and your Twitter ego is keeping you awake at night, you can turn to the unscrupulous tactic of buying thousands of "followers" from online sites. But do beware – there may be a lot of fake profiles in there and, at the end of the day, it'll feel like paying a crowd of people you don't know to come to your birthday party.
Happy tweeting!
China Central Television announced on Sunday the launch of News CCTV for mobile devices.
The new online platform, composed of an app (for both Android and Apple) and www.newsnet.net tailored for mobile devices, are expected to offer users not only more news reports but also more room for participation in news reporting. When a news story breaks, the platform will contact users near the spot and ask them to upload live videos from there.
The platform will also help 37 TV stations on the Chinese mainland, among which most are provincial satellite operations, to bring relevant content to their online viewers. The State broadcaster said it is part of a strategy to integrate technology development, news distribution and management of intellectual property.
In December, CCTV announced rebranding its news channels as China Global Television Network.

"Chinese tea is very famous in Sri Lanka. The first Chinese tea I ever had was green tea. The aroma was very pleasant. Although it was tea, it tasted like something totally different."
After learning more about Chinese tea, Anura founded Beijing Heavenly Trade Co Ltd to do tea business between China and Sri Lanka in 2003.
However, Anura faced great challenges due to different business environments and perspectives on high-end tea in China and Sri Lanka.
"Chinese people love leave tea and consider them high-end tea products. On the other hand, Sri Lankan people crush tea leaves and package them into tea bags for office people in the high-end market," Anura said.
When Anura tried to sell top-class Sri Lankan tea to Chinese customers, he struggled to find any buyers. It took him about a year to sell the first shipment of 480 boxes of Sri Lankan tea in China.


Movie buffs will soon be able to celebrate with a visual feast at the Beijing International Film Festival, where nearly 500 high quality films will be shown - the largest selection this year in the Chinese capital.

The movies were selected from more than 2,000 titles from 100 countries and will be screened in 30 cinemas and colleges around Beijing from April 8 to April 23, Zhang Xiaoguang, deputy head of China Film Archive, said Thursday.

As this year marks the 10th anniversary of the iconic Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni's death, up to 13 of his classics - from his debut feature Story of a Love Affair to the 1995 romance Beyond the Clouds - will be screened as an homage to the master.

Such highlighted talents also include cult director David Lynch of the United States and the versatile Taiwan filmmaker Sylvia Chang, whose representative works are on the recommended lineup.

The list also has some movies that earned awards at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival in February, such as the best movie winner On Body and Soul and best director winner The Other Side of Hope, by Aki Kaurismaki of Finland.

A retrospective section will include movies produced by the Shanghai studio Wenhua, a company founded in 1946 that ushered a new era of Chinese art-house films, Zhang said, giving viewers "a glimpse of Chinese cinematic culture and history".

While the festival delights die-hard fans, it also will soon make Beijing a hot word in film circles around the world. The opening and closing ceremonies on April 16 and 23, respectively, will be attended by a number of celebrities, including Italian actress Monica Bellucci, Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Oscar-winning British actor Sir Ben Kingsley.

The Tiantan awards, the festival's highest honor, will be presented to 10 winners selected by an international jury headed by Oscar-winning Danish director Bille August.
WARSAW - The director of Warsaw zoo and his wife always carried cyanide during World War II. Danger was ever-present but they were ready to take their secret to the grave.
The couple hid nearly 300 Jews and resistance fighters on zoo grounds during most of the war, under the noses of the German Nazis occupying Poland.
It sounds like a Hollywood movie, and now it is. But The Zookeeper's Wife, which opens in Polish cinemas this week before rolling out internationally, is based on actual events.
Inside the zookeeper's villa, whose windowless cellar had a secret tunnel leading to the garden, Jan Zabinski and his wife Antonina gave refuge to the mostly Jews smuggled out of the city's ghetto.
"I remember squatting under this concrete shelf in the basement and keeping my hand over my sister's mouth to muffle her cries because she was constantly crying, day and night," said Moshe Tirosh, aged 5 at the time.
"When someone slammed the door upstairs, fear would pass through me, lest they find us," the 80-year-old told AFP in a telephone interview.
The retired businessman and grandfather-of-seven, who has lived in Israel since 1957, still cannot believe what he lived through.
"I saw children's dead bodies on the street. Terrible things ... I remember wondering why everyone wanted to kill us. I couldn't understand it," he said.
All but two of the zoo's hidden guests survived the war and Nazi troops stationed on the bombed-out zoo grounds never unearthed the subterfuge.
"My parents figured that it's always darkest under a lamppost," the zoo couple's daughter Teresa Zabinska said, citing a Polish saying according to which it is best to hide in plain sight.
"My father knew that it wouldn't occur to the Germans that so many people could be hiding in a place like this with open windows and no curtains," the 73-year-old said.
Most hid in empty animal enclosures or the villa's basement. Others were able to stay with the family upstairs by taking on fake identities as Antonina's tailor or their son Ryszard's tutor.
Between 1940 and 1944, nearly 300 people found refuge, some for just a few hours or days, but others remained months or even years.
"Around 30 people would stay here at once," said Olga Zbonikowska, 38, who works for the Panda Foundation that takes care of the villa now.
The stakes were high. In occupied Poland, even offering Jews a glass of water was punishable by death.
Whenever a Nazi soldier got too close for comfort, Antonina would warn everyone by playing an operetta on the piano.
The hidden guests would escape through the tunnel or hide in a wardrobe upstairs that opened on both sides like a magician's trunk.
The couple also hid the Jews from their housekeeper out of fear she could give them away.
Aptly, her mother's memoirs - to be republished this month - were entitled People and Animals.
American author Diane Ackerman relied heavily on the memoirs when writing her own 2007 nonfiction book The Zookeeper's Wife, which inspired the movie. Directed by Niki Caro, it stars Golden Globe winner Jessica Chastain.
The Zabinskis died in the early 1970s. The villa is now a museum where visitors can make an appointment to see the life-saving secret tunnel and basement.
Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust remembrance centre later recognised the Zabinskis as Righteous Among the Nations, a title bestowed upon non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust.
"They believed it was the right thing to do," Teresa said, of her parents' wartime actions. "My father always said that's what a decent person should do."

The Third Maritime Silk Road International Brand Expo and the 20th Straits Textile & Clothing Fair will be held in Shishi in Fujian province from April 18 to 20.
Shishi Fashion Week will follow from April 24 to 27.
This year, the event will highlight the ideas of innovation and entrepreneurship, promoting Shishi as a center of the casualwear industry.
The event will also introduce more international cooperation and exchanges with the countries along the ancient Maritime Silk Road. It will build a commercial platform for the exhibitors and promote new business models like cross border e-commerce.
As global warming reshapes the Arctic and Antarctic, a new museum built by the son of a renowned French explorer aims to show "the beauty of polar landscapes" and illustrate the consequences of climate change.
The center in eastern France is "the only permanent museum devoted to the Arctic and Antarctic in the world," said communications director Anthony Renou.
Built in the shape of a jutting iceberg and with 60 percent of its volume buried underground, the museum was conceived by anthropologist Jean-Christophe Victor - son of the French polar explorer Paul-Emile Victor - and Stephane Niveau, a naturalist.
Once inside, visitors are plunged into a world of intense white. Huge video screens show the ice caps amid the noise of an icy blizzard.
Photographs, items from polar expeditions and video presentations - on ecosystems, rising sea levels, indigenous peoples and other themes - bring the polar environment to life and expose its vulnerability to global warming.
The Arctic's surface temperature has risen by more than 2 C since the late 19th century - double the pace of the world as a whole.
At the other end of the planet, scientists are most concerned about Antarctica's western peninsula, sitting underneath a kilometer-thick ice sheet with enough frozen water to lift global sea levels by 6 or 7 meters.
70,000 visitors per year?
Warming air and ocean water are eroding dam-like seaside formations called ice shelfs that prevent massive inland glaciers from sliding more quickly into the ocean.
The museum, Espace des Mondes Polaires Paul-Emile Victor, provides a visually compelling tutorial on these changes.
"The idea was to open a place that could serve as a support to teaching about the polar world, while approaching it in a playful way," said the museum's director Stephane Niveau.
Jean-Christophe Victor, who died in December at the age of 69, had said he wanted to make visitors "feel the beauty of these polar landscapes and lights, of the disproportion of man in relation to the nature which surrounds him".
The museum highlights objects and documents from the expeditions involving his father, a pioneer of modern ecology who documented the polar wilderness. Paul-Emile Victor died in 1995 at age 87.
The adventurer, who spent much of his childhood in the region where the museum is located, carried out his first missions to Greenland in 1934.
The museum includes a documentation center which is accessible to researchers, a skating rink and a conference hall.
The local authorities which manage the establishment hope to attract 50,000 to 70,000 visitors per year.

A joint venture of French nursing home operator Colisee Group plans to open its first Chinese complex in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in January next year as a starting point for its ambition to tap the rapidly growing demand for elderly care services in the country.
The high-end medical nursing home by joint venture Guangzhou China Merchants－Colisee Senior Care Service Co Ltd combines independent living communities, assisted living facilities, nursing homes and care options to provide a "continuum of care" for residents, said General Manager Olivier Dessajan.
In the 12,000-square-meter, 132-bed facility in Panyu district, a joint venture with China Merchants Shekou Holdings Co Ltd, 66 beds will be dedicated to those with Alzheimer's disease or other associated diseases.
"We are mostly focusing on the wealthy class," Dessajan said.
"Based on our expertise of senior care services in France, especially with taking care of elderly people with Alzheimer's or other cognitive dysfunctions, semi-dependent and dependent elderly people are mainly our service targets."
Each resident will have their own room and a customized daily program based on their experience, habits, tastes and health condition, with a nursing service always on hand.
Innovative health and care programs will be provided to help improve the residents' mental and physical condition, combining medical treatment, non-drug therapy, occupational therapy, the Montessori method and an adapted nutritional diet.
"As an Alzheimer's expert, we work step-by-step with the elderly and their family to understand and diagnose the disease in order to accompany the elderly in the best way until the final stage of life," he said.
"As there is no or not yet a pension institution in Guangzhou which can provide some particular services for Alzheimer's, when we talk about our project and expertise, lots of people have shown interest," Dessajan said.
Guangzhou has seen a drastic increase in the demand for senior care services with the proportion of elderly in its population continuing to grow, said Ye Fen, director of the social welfare division of the Guangzhou civil affairs bureau.
The number of seniors in its population currently stands at 1.48 million－or 17.3 percent of the total population of the city－including 238,000 above the age of 80 and 268,000 people in families with only seniors.
Ye said the senior population in Guangzhou was expected to surpass 1.85 million by 2020, creating growing demand in the elderly care service market.
About 59,000 beds are provided in Guangzhou currently, averaging 40 beds for every 1,000 elderly people.
Last month, a new nursing home complex was opened in Luogang district in Guangzhou, which offers 1,300 beds.
Guangdong Trading Holding Group Co announced in February it plans to invest in a 5,000-bed nursing home project in Conghua district.
"According to official studies, the Chinese market for goods and services for seniors is growing very fast, both for the high-end and low-end market. China will be without doubt the largest potential market for elderly care in the world," Dessajan said.
The senior care industry has developed quickly over the last five years, but remains woefully inadequate to cope with the projected increase in the elderly population in China, according to a recent report by Savills, an international real estate adviser.
Documents from China's State Council and Guangzhou city government highlight Sino-foreign cooperation in the sector.
The French consulate general in Guangzhou and the civil affairs bureau of Guangzhou signed a memorandum of understanding last month on elderly care cooperation. That was an outcome of the long-term blueprint for the development of Sino-French ties, published during a visit to France in 2014 by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Cooperation over elderly care has become a new priority in bilateral ties, said Pierre Martin, economic counselor with the consulate.
With 30 years' experience in senior care and management, Colisee Group runs 77 nursing homes and several rehabilitation centers in Europe.
Joint venture China Merchants－Colisee is designing a project in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and conducting a feasibility study for two projects in Beijing and Shanghai.

With the arrival of spring, flowers are blooming in the warm air. Cherry and peach blossoms, peonies, tulips and many other flowers are adding fragrance to the beautiful season.
People are taking spring outings to admire the flowers. While, our first thought when we see beautiful flowers is to take photos and post them on social media platforms, ancient people in China had their own ways of admiring flowers.
Various ways of admiring flowers
During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-960), it is said that the official Han Xizai loved to burn incense near a flower vase because he liked the combination of the fragrance of flowers and incense. Using flowers in this way was popular during Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties.
During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), people preferred to chant or sip wine while being surrounded by flowers. Music also goes well with flowers and refined scholars in Song Dynasty loved to play music to flowers. The musical instruments were thought to match different kinds of flowers. According to ancient book records, elegant flowers such as jasmine went well with the musical instrument heptachord.
China's only female emperor Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty was obsessed with flowers. The peony in ancient Luoyang was quite famed and each year when peonies flowered, she would hold celebrations and feasts.
Gardens of the Northern Hemisphere explode with color as spring unfolds, and Chinese tourists are eager to discover
As weather warms up, many have taken time off to get away and feel the spring in the air, especially blossoms.
Destinations in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Europe and America, will all look their best at this time of year. Moreover, cheaper flights and national holidays in April and May have also encouraged many travelers to plan trips outside the mainland.
"Most of our blossom trips abroad have enjoyed good sales," says Li Mengran of Beijing Utour International Travel Service Co, a major outbound tourism operator.

Utour launched dozens of flower-themed travel products in mid February.
They feature sakura (cherry) in Japan, tulips in Netherlands, Claude Monet's Garden in France, camellias in Switzerland and oriental cherries in Germany's Bonn.
The Dutch and Japanese tours have witnessed the best bookings so far, according to Li.
"Half of trips to those two destinations have been fully booked till May," she says.
In addition to flowers, local in-depth experiences, various outdoors activities, including cycling and watching live sports shows, have been arranged to spice up visitor's experiences.
Utour has added tours that include Michelin dining, a Kyoto kimono experience and the Sagano Romantic Train in Japan. The 25-minute train ride follows the course of the Hozu River on a narrow-gauge track through an idyllic canyon. In the Netherlands, cycling through fields in full bloom, a fresh flower auction and riding a vintage steam train through villages filled with flowers are also on the itinerary for April and May travelers.
It's also an ideal time to avoid crowds, to travel and enjoy flowers before the peak tourism period, when summer vacations start in June.
You don't have to rough it to enjoy nature.
HHtravel, the high-end branch of China's biggest online travel agency Ctrip, has rolled out blossom trips with luxury arrangements all around the globe.
In Bulgaria, a land of idyllic beauty in the Balkan region, the travel agency arranges for visitors to experience the annual local rose festival on the first Monday in June. Tourists can enjoy various activities, such as rose-picking, a parade and voting for the rose queen. It's a great way to feel the country's distinctive charm and traditions in a festive atmosphere.
At Kazanlak Rose Valley, roses of different varieties, shapes and colors are a visual spectacle. A special rose-themed lunch will be served at a local wine cellar. Visitors can also get local rose water and see how essential oils are made at a distillation workshop and enjoy rose-petal bath salts.
Local world culture heritages including Rila Monastery and the Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak, a brick-vaulted "beehive" burial chamber, are also places travelers shouldn't miss.
Romania has been added on the trip and tourists can take in legendary vampire-related sites and an ancient castle.
Bulgaria and Romania now offer those with multi-entry Schengen visas free access to their country.
Distinctive hotels are a highlight in France when tourists visit the countryside to see the immense fields of spiky lavender.
In Provence, the lavender season continues from June to August. The fragrance is said to dispel trouble and help one find peace. In the country's southern city of Nice, the Negresco Hotel is perched on the bay and wins raves from visiting celebrities from around the world. It offers Michelin-starred dining, too.
At Lake of Sainte-Croix, accommodation can be arranged at La Bastide De Moustiers amid lavender fields and olive trees, a thorough immersion in elemental southern France.
HHtravel has set aside time for tourists to meander in the blossom sea and take pictures. In Paris, tourists can opt for the Shangri-La Hotel built on the private mansion of Napoleon Bonaparte's grandnephew to feel the royal touch.
The best time for flower viewing in the Netherlands is from late March to early May. Unlike Utour, HHtravel chooses Keukenhof as a destination, for visitors to savor the country's famous tulips. The park offers 6 million flowers of many varieties, not just tulips. Boating experiences can also be arranged. In addition, visitors can take a small airplane to get a bird's-eye view of the multicolored tulip fields. Tulip field owners can offer tour groups an introduction to local history and culture, and the Aalsmeer flower market offers a glimpse into an exciting slice of local life.
Belgium can be packaged with the Netherlands experience to add diversity to the trip. The historic town of Brugge offers elegance and leisure that are typical of old Europe.
In Asia, Japan has been chosen by the high-end travel designer for its blossom experience.
There are two blossom trips to the country. One covers Hakone, Fujiyama and Tokyo, and the other features Kyoto, Nara and Osaka.
Japan has greeted a torrent of visitors during the March and May periods when its sakura come into blossom. Private hot-spring arrangement has been made for those who want to avoid crowds. Independent courtyard-styled hot spring facility at the Mount Fuji Hakone National Park offers magnificent sakura viewing.
Kaiseki ryori, the Japanese equivalent of Western haute cuisine, and top-notch sushi will be ready to satisfy tourists' palates.
Train ride through thousands of sakura in Arashiyama, colorful blossoms at Daigoji Temple, and temple tea rituals are all highlights tucked in HHtravel's Japan blossom trip.
