After hearing the word "mother" in association to a U.S. military weapon, Pope Francis says he was "ashamed."
According to Reuters, the Pope spoke with a group of students, telling them, "A mother gives life and this one gives death..."
The Pope continued, "We call this device a mother. What is happening?"
The device he's referring to is the U.S. military's Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), also known as "the mother of all bombs."
The Hill reports the bomb killed at least 94 ISIS fighters last month when the U.S. targeted an ISIS complex in Afghanistan.
In spite of their differing stances on many issues, Pope Francis is expected to meet with President Trump on May 24.

Not only does it look great on our stovetop, but the simplicity of its design and use is pretty unbelievable. To create coffee-shop quality espresso drinks, all you have to do is unscrew the top from the bottom, fill the bottom with water, add in ground espresso beans to the funnel, screw it back up and heat it on the stove. It only takes around five minutes all in.
To clean the Bialetti, all you need to do is run some warm water through it. Best of all, the taste of the espresso actually gets better with use, so it'll last you!

Membership is most certainly priced for the rich and famous with a $7,500 annual membership fee. That doesn't even include the terminal fee, which you have to pay every time you fly: $2,700 for up to four people. (That's $3,000 for international flights.) At least that includes free pre-flight massages and manicures.
The Private Suite experience is different from any other airport experience from the get-go. Travelers are screened by the TSA in the private terminal and don't have to deal with their baggage. A team of eight people are at your disposal, including several drivers and an airport escort.
"It typically takes 2,200 footsteps from car seat to plane seat," the website reads. "For members of The Private Suite, it's 70 footsteps. And they are all peaceful footsteps."
Instead of searching for your gate and then scrambling to buy a bottle of water and magazines to read on the plane, members can hang out in their fully stocked private suites or a shared lounge when waiting for their flight. Then, instead of lining up to board, members are driven on the tarmac straight to their plane "head-of-state style."

Just checked into my own suite at the all new private celebrity terminal at LAX. Easily the most luxurious airport experience ever! 8 people taking care of each guest, suites right next to the runway, and private BMW chauffeur to the airplane stairs. Also, private TSA and Customs lounge just for you. This is bliss! #theprivatesuite #lax
If he was actually going to catch a flight, a silver BMW 7 Series would have taken him across the tarmac straight to his plane.
The major appeal of the private plane boarding and disembarking seems to be no paparazzi, which admittedly sounds great for stars hounded by cameras.
The only problem: Those suites are going to make it hard to want to get on the plane.

A white former South Carolina police officer pleaded guilty Tuesday to violating the civil rights of Walter Scott, the unarmed black motorist he shot dead in 2015.
"The defendant used deadly force even though it was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances," the plea agreement says.
Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Scott's brother, Anthony, thanked federal prosecutors and said his family was grateful to have "justice."
"For me and my family, the healing starts today," Anthony Scott said, adding that Slager's guilty plea was a "victory" for his city, state, country and the world.
Walter Scott's mother, Judy, fought back tears as she told reporters she forgives Slager.
"I forgive Michael Slager because the forgiver is in me. That he [Slager] admitted he did it was enough years for me," she said.
Slager, 35, pulled over Scott on April 4, 2015, due to a broken taillight. Scott, 50, then ran from the traffic stop. The incident escalated, Slager has claimed, when Scott wrestled away the officer's Taser. Slager then fired his weapon as Scott ran away. Scott was struck five times in the back.
See Gallery
Slager's federal trial was set to begin on May 15, and jury selection was slated to begin May 9.
The former officer pleaded guilty to violating Scott's civil rights by shooting him with no justification — formally known as deprivation of rights under color of law. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
"We hope that Michael's acceptance of responsibility will help the Scott family as they continue to grieve their loss," Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, said in a statement. Sentencing has not yet been scheduled, Savage said.
The shooting itself heightened tension nationwide over alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement and systemic racism in policing.

According to a complaint and affidavit, On April 13th, 2017, Chesney Anne Wheeler, 38, gave birth prematurely to her daughter at 29-weeks, at her home in Williamsport. After giving birth, she told police that she took the baby out of the toilet, and wrapped her in a blanket before she passed out. When she woke up, Wheeler drove to a local drug treatment center, then to a friends with the baby's body in a cardboard box in the backseat.
She sought treatment at Wilkes Barre Hospital later that evening. At the hospital, Wheeler lied to staff about the baby's whereabouts and where she had given birth. She told staff that she had miscarried in Benton, Pa and that she flushed the 29-week "fetus" down the toilet. The hospital staff grew suspicious of a 29-week old fetus fitting down a toilet and notified police. Police later found the body in her back seat.
Wheeler admitted to police that she had given birth in Williamsport and she was afraid to take the baby to a local hospital because she had smoked crack and used heroin the night before she gave birth and was "scared they would find drugs in her system" Wheeler stated when she woke up, that the baby was limp and knew she was dead.
I wasn't thrilled about being pregnant. That's the truth" she told police.
A friend, who went with Wheeler, admitted that the two cleaned the bathroom where the baby was born and washed the towels before leaving to go to Wilkes Barre Hospital.
Wheeler is charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, obstruction of justice, and flight to avoid apprehension.
She is currently at Lycoming County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail.

Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon may be trying to make their relationship work again.
The couple, who got divorced back in 2015 after six years of marriage, have always spent a lot of time together, especially when with their children. They share twins Moroccan and Monroe, 6, and frequently post photos on social media and attend events together as a foursome. A couple week after stepping out as a family to the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, Carey and Cannon brought their twins to Disneyland for their birthday.
See Gallery
Though another insider contends that they're merely "co-parenting," the other source's claims make sense given that Carey recently broke up with her background dancer boyfriend, who she was dating for about a year after ending her engagement to Canadian billionaire James Packer.
"We're together when it counts," Carey told ET at her Butterfly MC Records launch event on Tuesday when asked about their relationship. "We're together for the kids, and I think that's the most important thing."
Back in February, Cannon welcomed another child, two-month old son Golden, with former Miss Arizona, Brittany Bell.

Gas prices are as high as they've been in more than 19 months and projected to rise further due to the impending summer driving season, according to GasBuddy. But there is some good news.
Specifically, Monday offers the lowest average gas prices, while Thursday offers the highest, based on GasBuddy's analysis of three years of gas price data. As the company notes:
"To put the amount of savings into perspective: If every U.S. motorist bought gasoline on Thursday for an entire year, they'd collectively spend an extra $1.1 billion versus filling up on Monday ..."
The best day of the week for buying gas does vary from year to year and state to state. But the study concludes that buying gas earlier in the week — as well as shopping around for the lowest price — still will save money for "many motorists."

GasBuddy, the company behind the free app of the same name, estimates that drivers can save an average of $325 per year by shopping around and using the GasBuddy app.

The app for Android and Apple mobile devices boasts "the most accurate, real-time fuel prices at more than 140,000 unique stations in the U.S., Canada and Australia," among other crowd-sourced information about gas stations.
Perhaps the easiest way to save a big chunk of change on gas, though, is by simply not paying extra for premium-grade gasoline if your car was designed to run on regular-grade gas.

The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.5% as of March 2017, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in many states the jobs that are currently available and growing are not necessarily the ones that have traditionally been available. With the economy doing relatively well, SmartAsset took a look at the fastest-growing jobs in different parts of the country.
Study Specifics
SmartAsset used Bureau of Labor statistics to find the fastest-growing job in each state (plus Washington, D.C.). We defined fastest-growing job as the job which saw the most growth in terms of raw numbers of people employed from 2012 to 2016 in each state. For more on where we got our data and how we put it together, please read the data and methodology.
Key Findings
And the winner is... – The fastest-growing occupation in the country is solar photovoltaic installer. Never heard of it? These are the people who maintain, assemble and install solar panels on roofs. This occupation only requires a high school education, as much of the training occurs on the job. Nationwide solar photovoltaic installers make about $42,500, on average.

Income inequality – There is a stark pay difference among the fastest-growing jobs in different states. The number of recordkeepers in Nevada, for example, grew 176%, but only made an average income of $27,610 in 2016. Food and tobacco roasting, baking and drying machine operators in Georgia make an average of $27,000 per year. That job grew 340% from 2012 to 2016. On the flip side, general practitioners in Massachusetts and computer and information research scientists in Michigan earn more than six figures per year, and both jobs saw the number employed more than double.
Financial examiners – People who work as financial examiners ensure compliance with financial laws. This occupation was the single fastest-growing job in three different states: New Jersey, Florida and Ohio. In fact, the occupation of financial examiner grew in every single state except for two, Oklahoma and Georgia. Only one other occupation was the fastest-growing in three different states: occupational health and safety technicians.
Manufacturing Jobs
Food batch maker was the fastest-growing job in Tennessee and food and tobacco roasting, baking and drying machine operator was the fastest-growing job in Georgia. In Mississippi, chemical plant operator came out on top, as did engine and other machine assemblers in Kentucky.
No state had an occupation grow as fast as machine assemblers grew in Kentucky. Their numbers swelled over 800% from 2012 to 2016. In 2012 there were about 170 engine and other machine assemblers in Kentucky, while in 2016 there were 1,560. This is a fairly well-paying job. It does not require a college degree and, at least in Kentucky, brings in an income of almost $40,000 per year.
Other parts of the country also saw growth in certain manufacturing fields. For example, sawing machine operator was the fastest-growing job in Pennsylvania, while in Montana it was coating, painting and spraying machine setters, operators and tenders. The only two fastest growing production occupations and state pairings which did not involve work with heavy machinery were hand sewers in Minnesota and medical appliance technicians in Indiana.
STEM Jobs
STEM jobs tend to be some of the most desired as they frequently offer high pay and have good growth prospects. On the national level, mathematics- and computer-related occupations (which is how the BLS officially categorizes STEM jobs) was the second-fastest-growing field.
In other states, STEM jobs were the second- or third-fastest growing. For example, in Nebraska, surveying and mapping technician was the single fastest-growing job but the second-fastest was operational research analysts, a STEM job. Operational research analysts grew 250% from 2012 to 2016 in Nebraska.
Other fast-growing STEM occupations include statisticians in Nevada (150% growth), actuaries in Oklahoma (133% growth) and application software developers in Georgia (86% growth).
Teaching Jobs
Teaching is traditionally a dependable occupation. Teaching-related occupations were the fastest-growing jobs in seven states. Of those seven, four – Illinois, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. – saw postsecondary teachers receive the strongest growth. In each of these states, the fastest-growing postsecondary occupation makes at least $70,000 per year.
Teaching can be a mixed bag when it comes to compensation. Preschool special education teacher is a pretty well-paying occupation, but requires quite a lot of education. On average special education preschool teachers in Connecticut make just under $70,000 and requires a college degree. Substitute teachers and library technicians on the other hand tend to make around $30,000 and require less education.
Medical Jobs 
Like teachers, medical professionals will likely always be in demand. There are eight states where the fastest-growing job is related to health care. Two states, Colorado and Wisconsin, saw massive increases in their number of psychiatric aides. Wisconsin, in particular, saw an enormous increase. In that state, the number of psychiatric aides grew by over 500% from 2012 to 2016.
Perhaps the most interesting example of growth in the health care field is the 300% growth in family and general practitioners in Massachusetts. This is a well-paid job, paying over $200,000 per year on average. Massachusetts, and especially Boston, is world-renowned for having great hospitals and medical schools, but a 300% increase in the number of general practitioners is unusual.
Phlebotomist, another healthcare occupation, was the number one growing occupation in Delaware. What exactly is a phlebotomist? For the less medically aware, a phlebotomist is the person who draws your blood for tests. Say you have an allergic reaction and you need to get a blood test, a phlebotomist would be the person helping you. The number of phlebotomists in Delaware grew 168% from 2012 to 2016. On average they make about $36,000.
Other Notable Occupations
Texas is not unique in embracing creative jobs. Commercial and industrial designing occupations in Alabama are up 214% and multimedia artists and animators saw an increase of 260% in their numbers in South Carolina. In Massachusetts and Florida, fashion designing jobs increased by over 100%.
For any true crime fans who want a career solving crimes, Kansas may be a good state to check out. Forensic science technician was the fastest-growing job here, with an increase in number from around 60 in 2012 to 350 in 2016.
Finally, when you think of jobs in New York state, you may picture investment bankers or taxi drivers in New York City and perhaps farmers in upstate New York. Turns out the fastest-growing job in the state is actually sociologists. Overall the sociology profession in New York grew 450% from 2012 to 2016. Interestingly the average income for a sociologist dropped by $23,000 from $96,330 in 2012 to $73,030 in 2016.
Data & Methodology
In order to find the fastest-growing jobs in each state (plus Washington D.C.), we looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, we looked at the number of employed people in each occupation in 2012 and compared it to the number of employed people in that occupation in 2016. We filtered out any occupation where the relative standard error for the estimate of the number of people employed in the occupation was greater than 20. We also filtered out occupations that were classified as "other." We ranked each occupation in each state by the percent growth over that five-year period.
All average salary data is from the Bureau Labor Statistics and is for 2016.

If you live in New York City—or lurk on social media even a little bit—chances are you've come across the following strange and wondrous sight: A huge, colorful arrangement of fresh flowers placed at a seemingly random location. Perhaps a larger-than-life bouquet of forsythia and sunflowers bursting from an empty city trash can. Or a mammoth garland of roses draped around a statue in Central Park.
These installations are so striking, they've likely caused you to stop in your tracks. They've also likely caused you to ponder the identity of the genius bandit behind these glorious acts.
See Gallery
"My team and I work really fast and very early in the a.m. Our call time for these flashes is 5:45 a.m., and we try to finish them before sunrise. We always recycle flowers from events when possible."
"I don't see us stopping anytime soon. These flashes are so gratifying and rewarding on many levels. There is something sort of 'Banksy-esque' about what we do, which is fun and exciting!"
"We never broadcast where our next flash will be. They just pop up randomly. We do have a hashtag that we spray by each installation: LMD x NYC. It is chalk spray paint, so it washes away in the rain. It's our way of saying #LMDWasHere."
"I can't tell you what's next, but I can reveal that we are thinking bigger and planning for that! I would love to get some funding to do these flashes on a much larger scale and reach a lot more New Yorkers. I'd also like to Flower Flash other cities. Chicago, Mexico City, Miami, Los Angeles . . . they are all on my list."
"Who doesn't love to get flowers? They are such a luxury, and New York City is a very gritty, fast-paced town. If we can bring nature—something wild and sumptuous—to New Yorkers and make them smile, the way people smile when they witness a random act of kindness, then that is a great thing. That is my goal. It's a really simple vision but powerful, I think, to try to create an emotional response through flowers."

Celine Dion can finally relax.
The price for the lavish house stood at $38.5 million at the time of the sale, though the ultimate price has not been disclosed.
That price was arrived at after a series of price chops over the last four years. It originally asked $72.5 million in 2013.
See Gallery
The singer had previously lowered the price to $45.5 million after her husband, René Angélil, died last year. Dion and her late husband bought the lot the house sits on for $12.5 million in 2005, then the adjacent mansion for $7 million in 2008. They then razed the existing home to build the current spread.
Cristina Condon of Sotheby's International Realty had the listing.

Not sure what to wear to a job interview? You might want to play it safe — and classy — and simply don black.
The survey included 180 successful applicants and 1,800 rejected candidates.
"You have to match [your outfit to] the company culture. If you show up in jeans at Citibank, it may not be well-received."
Once you make it to the job interview, it's important to make a good impression — and quickly.
It's not the usual blah, blah, blah. Click here to sign up for our free newsletter.

But before you get the opportunity to "wow" a potential employer in an interview — wearing a mostly black outfit appropriate for the work environment — you need to first pique their interest with your resume.
Keep in mind: Most companies have software programs known as applicant tracking systems (ATS) that "read" resumes before they're potentially passed on to a hiring manager.
It's important to understand how the software works so you can tweak your resume to best match what an ATS is looking for. For example, keep your resume formatting simple. Bowsher writes:
Images, special characters, fancy formatting (like tables, shading, text boxes, borders and separators) — as well as typos — can also confuse an applicant tracking system.

Two coffee shop unicorns are sharpening their horns to wage a legal battle.
Needless to say, Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino contained none of those ingredients.
Looks like 🎂🍭🍬🍦💎🍰🍩 . Tastes like 🍋🍯🌴🙃🤷🏼‍♀️💥🌈 . Made with 🌊🌿🌺🍯🍋🍈💙 . Makes you feel like ⚡️🙌👁🦄😍🤸🏽‍♀️🚀 . 📸: @shilin_cchen
However, The End claims that the Unicorn Frappuccino was too similar in outward appearance to their unicorn latte. Both drinks prominently display bright colors, pink and blue in particular.
The End also felt that Starbucks' product launch was designed to overshadow their unicorn latte, with the lawsuit also noting that The End has had a trademark pending on the drink name since January.
Image: starbucks
Starbucks, of course, stated that the accusations have no grounds. And while part of us hates siding with corporate giants, we may have to agree with them here. It's very hard to imagine that Starbucks designed both their drink and their marketing campaign to purposefully overshadow a small cafe in Brooklyn.
The drinks are also fundamentally different to their very core. Starbucks' unicorn is all about sugary sweetness while The End's unicorn attempts to help people find energy through all-natural ingredients (algae!). Because of that, these two unicorn drinks automatically target two almost completely different audiences. You drink the latte when you want to keep your good vibes going after some restorative yoga, and you drink the frappuccino when you want to treat yo'self and feel really guilty about it later.
Maybe everyone should just move on and stop the unicorn trend altogether.

May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. bobsledder Steven Holcomb, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead at a training site on Saturday, the U.S. Olympic Committee said.
Holcomb, 37, was discovered in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York, the committee said in a statement. It gave no further details.
Holcomb, who underwent successful surgery in 2008 to overcome a degenerative eye disease, made history at the Vancouver Olympics when he piloted the U.S. four-man bobsled team, nicknamed "Night Train," to the gold medal.
It marked the first U.S. gold medal in the event since 1948 and the three-time Olympian's comeback from depression over increasing blindness, according to his biography on the Team USA website.
Holcomb took bronze medals in both two-man and four-man bobsled at the 2014 Sochi Games. He also won five world titles among his 10 world championship medals and was a six-time overall world cup champion, winning 60 world cup medals.
The New York State Police, which is handling the case, had no immediate comment on Holcomb's death.
"The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb," U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun said in a statement.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and the entire bobsledding community."
Holcomb's autobiography, "But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold," had outlined how people suffering from depression should seek treatment, the Team USA profile said.
"USA Bobsled & Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend," said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Chief Executive Darrin Steele. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, N.C. and Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

Today in daily airline outrage: A husband and wife with two small children onboard a recent overbooked Delta flight were threatened with jail time after being told they could not use a seat they'd purchased for their 18-year-old son, who had instead taken an earlier flight.
Brian and Brittany Schear were flying from Maui to Los Angeles with their three children, reportedly ages 18, 2 and 1. They bought three tickets, likely thinking the youngsters would sit on the laps of the other three during the flight. But the family changed plans ahead of time, buying a ticket for their older son on an earlier flight so, as the father said, their other son would actually be able to sleep.
This did not sit well with Delta.
Because the Schear's older son never checked in for the later flight on which he was booked, the airline likely viewed it as an open seat available to a passenger not yet onboard.
The Schears bought the seat, though, and figured it wouldn't be a problem to set up a safety seat for one of their infants.

Thus, the conflict.
The video starts with Brian Schear being told that he and his wife could wind up in jail with their children in "foster care" if they didn't give up their third seat.
The situation was already tense, but it's about to get confusing, so stay with me.
At this point, a woman introduces herself and begins to explain the situation, although she doesn't appear to have a good grip on what she's explaining. Presumably an airline employee, she informs the Schears that their younger son has to be held in their laps instead of a safety seat.
"With him being two, he cannot sit in the car seat," she says, and goes on to say that this is an FAA regulation.
In fact, the opposite is true. According to an emailed FAA statement, "children two [years] of age or older are required to be in their own seat."
We've asked Delta to get on the phone with us in hopes of clearing up which employees were responsible for providing incorrect information, and why that information was provided in the first place. They haven't taken us up on it yet.
Now, it seems logical to just transfer the older son's ticket to the younger son. With a new name attached to the seat, the flight manifest would accurately reflect the actual flight, and everyone onboard could go about their business. But Delta doesn't allow ticket transfers.
After it becomes plain that the Schears won't be able to use the three seats they purchased, Brian asks whether — for the sake of finally taking off — they can just hold their kids and get out of there.
Apparently not. He's told, "it's come too far," and their options are either to go or Delta will deplane everyone.
"What are we supposed to do?" Schear asks. "I've got two infants, and my wife, we have nowhere to stay, there's no more flights. What are we supposed to do, sleep in the airport?"
Schear presses for an answer, but the (presumable) Delta employee says it's not up to her or any of her colleagues.
"At this point, you guys are on your own," she says.
"Un-fucking-real," Schear says.
Hard to disagree.

Always Dreaming has won the 143rd running of the Kentucky Derby with jockey John Velazquez.
He was the late favorite going into the race with 4 to 1 odds. Lookin at Lee and Battle of Midway came in at second and third respectively. Classic Empire, who had been another favorite in the days leading up to the race, came in fourth. 
Rainy weather leading up to the race made for a muddy track. 
The Kentucky Derby is the first race in the Triple Crown, followed by the Preakness and the Belmont. The last horse to win all three was American Pharoah in 2015.

The runaway favorite of this taste test, Classico is slightly sweet, pleasantly herby and the perfect consistency to grab onto your pasta. Our editors described it as "lovely," saying it could pass for fresh sauce, with chunks of delicious tomato and basil throughout. When you're unable to make your own, Classico is surely the next best thing.
Getty
Though not as universally beloved by our team, Barilla's Traditional sauce is a solid option for a weeknight dinner. It has a much stronger, zestier garlic taste than many of the others, and that certainly isn't a bad thing. With a smoother texture than Classico, editors found themselves liking it the more they tasted, saying, "It has character."
Getty
This jarred option immediately evoked a familiarity and nostalgia for our taste testers. It's quite sweet, which some editors loved, and has a good amount of oregano flavor, as well as a meaty texture. This sauce takes third place, though, because it tastes more like pizza sauce than a good, fresh pasta sauce. 
Getty
Our taste testers were significantly divided on this sauce, with some calling it their favorite of the bunch and others claiming it had a strange, floral herbiness. It's the least sweet of all the jars, making it the perfect purchase for those who like a dryer tomato sauce. Like Newman's, it also has a familiar taste and reminded some editors of more traditional sauces. All in all, a riskier option but tasty nonetheless.

In his recipe for goat ragù, Di Meglio uses ground goat, preferably from the leg, for a Bolognese-style sauce. The result is a rich sauce with more flavor than you would ever get with pork and beef. If you're looking for an easy introduction to the protein, using ground goat is it.
Finishing up our pickled ramps! Until next year;) Goat loin and blackberry
While you can roast the leg low and slow, once you find a good purveyor of goat, you can play around with different cuts. Izard has run goat loin on her menu, serving it with pickled ramps and blackberries.

Retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Randolph "Tex" Alles, the current head of Customs and Border Protection, was named the director of the Secret Service on Tuesday.
Alles will take over for Secret Service Deputy Director William Callahan, who has been leading the agency in an acting capacity since March 4, when then-Director Joseph Clancy retired.
Alles' selection by President Donald Trump does not require Senate approval, and it marks a departure for the Secret Service, whose leaders have typically come from within its own ranks.

The announcement was made in a brief statement distributed by the White House.
The former major general will inherit an agency that's been mired in scandals, negative press attention and low morale.

One U.S. archdiocese is cutting ties with the Girl Scouts of the USA because it apparently promotes "programs and materials reflective of many of the troubling trends in our secular culture."
Archbishop Joseph Naumann of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas said the organization is "no longer a compatible partner." 
He cited its relationship with an international scouting association that he said advocates for "contraception and abortion as preventive health care for women." He also has concerns with the Girl Scouts featuring Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan as role models because they "stand in stark opposition to what we believe."

A Jerusalem-based Fox News employee is suing the network for discrimination and retaliation, following up on a statement made to European regulators that more litigation was coming by attorney who is representing more than a dozen clients against the network.
Jessica Golloher is a Fox News Radio correspondent in the Middle East and North Africa, and says she was notified within 24 hours of requesting via email an opportunity to speak with the network's independent investigator that her contract would not be renewed upon its August expiration.
"While Fox may claim that the decision to terminate Ms. Golloher was made before she sent the email on April 17, 2017, any such defense would be preposterous given that Ms. Golloher had previously complained about discriminatory treatment and she was provided no notice or warning whatsoever regarding any potential termination," writes attorney Douglas Wigdor.
Golloher claims she was marginalized because of her gender. She had been based in Moscow in 2013, working as the network's Russia correspondent, but when the Sochi Olympic Games approached they gave the lead reporting gig to a London-based male colleague instead of her. Golloher says she was told to act as Simon Owen's Russian translator and help in his reporting.

"Aware of Fox's blatant marginalization of her skills and its decision to promote a man as the voice of Fox during the Olympics, Ms. Golloher complained throughout the Sochi events about her discriminatory treatment and the fact that she was downgraded to 'secretarial' status for Mr. Owen's purposes," writes Wigdor in the complaint.
The correspondent also claims she was bumped to the late reporting shift and forced to cover "the ridiculous and frivolous 'panty protests'" following a ban on the import of lacy underwear, instead of covering "serious and relevant" news.
In another example, set two years later, Golloher says she complained to her superiors that an anchor-producer colleague was making "relentless edits" to her scripts and treating her like a "vapid, unintelligent female reporter."
Earlier this year, Golloher says she pitched a story that would require her to go to Afghanistan but was rejected because it was "exceedingly unsafe." She claims that shortly thereafter the network sent a male reporter to cover the exact story she had pitched.
See Gallery
She says she was informed she was being terminated because of "budgetary concerns."
"Since she has been informed of her termination, Ms. Golloher continues to be excluded from work assignments," writes Wigdor. "Moreover, freelance colleagues are being given assignments that are entirely within Ms. Golloher's area of expertise despite the fact that she is still on Fox's payroll."
Golloher is suing Fox News, its parent 21st Century Fox, VP of Fox News Radio Mitch Davis and Director of News Programming Hank Weinbloom for gender discrimination and retaliation.
"Mr. Wigdor's allegation regarding his client Jessica Golloher is without merit," a Fox representative said in a statement Wednesday. "Any suggestion of discrimination or retaliation is baseless. We will vigorously defend the matter." The company has not yet commented further on the matter now that the lawsuit has been filed.

Border Patrol in Arizona found a closed casket filled with 67 pounds of weed, worth over $33,000 over the weekend.
Border patrol agents stopped the hearse in the ironic town of Tombstone for an immigration stop. Manure was put over the marijuana to cover the smell.
After noticing inconsistencies with the driver's story, a canine unit was called to search the entire hearse and the man, who is a U.S. citizen, was arrested on suspicion of narcotics and contraband smuggling.
A press release stated that: "Transnational criminal organizations use a wide range of techniques to smuggle both humans and narcotics into the United States."

In SmartAsset's study on millennial retirement, we looked at median household income in the 15 biggest cities in America. We assumed that the average millennial would save 7.5% of their salary in a 401(k) with a 4% return starting at age 27. Using those numbers, we were able to estimate the age at which millennials living in those cities may be able to retire. We based the 7.5% savings rate on Fidelity Investments' Retirement Savings Assessment study which found that's the median saving rate (including employer match) for millennials. Read the full data and methodology below for a fuller picture on how we put this study together.
As you can see the state of retirement for millennials is not bad. This simulation assumes that millennials will start collecting Social Security benefits at age 67. If millennials can manage to save 7.5% of the median income per month (including any employer match) starting at age 27, it may be possible to retire relatively early. Even in expensive cities like New York or Los Angeles, the estimated retirement age based on the scenario we laid out is 65. In cities like San Jose or San Francisco, retiring requires more savings and so the estimated ages are 69 and 68, respectively.
To be on pace to retire at 65 in cities like New York and Los Angeles, millennials may only need to save around $300 per month, on average. In more affordable cities, like Philadelphia, that number drops as low as $240 per month. Even in San Jose, the city with the highest estimated retirement expenses, to retire at 69 with an annual income of $154,267 you will only need to squirrel away $529 per month, on average. Given that the median household income in San Jose is just under $85,000, that may be possible.

Let's take a look at what would happen if, instead of spending that money paying off student loan debt, millennials were able to invest it. A millennial who owes $14,425 on a 10-year student loan at 4.66% interest rate, can expect to pay about $151 a month. But if millennials invested $151 a month into an account earning 4% per year and reinvested the earnings into the same account, that $14,425 would turn into $26,617 after 20 years. After 35 years, about the time when millennials will be considering retirement, that $14,425 would have turned into $47,936. So, you can see how detrimental a late start on retirement savings can be.
In the first scenario we assumed millennials would receive Social Security payments starting at age 67. However, since 2010 the Social Security Administration has paid out more funds than it has taken in. At current rates the Social Security Administration has enough funds to last until 2037. After that time the Social Security Administration predicts it will have enough from tax payments to pay 76% of benefits. But without some changes in how it is funded the Social Security Administration will face a severe shortfall in the coming future.
With that in mind, we were curious to see what millennial retirement would look like if millennials were unable to receive any Social Security benefits.
The results are dire. If there's no Social Security benefits and millennials are only able to save 7.5% of today's household median income in each city, a normal retirement may not be possible.
In this scenario where millennials rely exclusively on savings in their 401(k), we estimate that the average millennial living the largest cities will not be able to retire until their 80s. Our calculator assumes an end point at age 95, so in most cities our calculator estimates that without Social Security, average millennials will have about 10 years' worth of income to retire on. That means working for almost 60 years for the chance to relax for only 10.
Take Columbus, Ohio, as an example. The average millennial who starts saving at 27 and receives Social Security payments at 67, may have enough income to retire at 64. In this scenario, Social Security payments would make up $53,000 of the $73,000 total annual retirement income. In the worst-case scenario, with no Social Security payments, the average Columbus millennial might not be able to retire until 85.
For this study on the state of millennial retirement, we looked at data on incomes and expenses in each city. We plugged those numbers into SmartAsset's retirement calculator. The calculator gave us the earliest age the average person would have enough money saved to retire in each city. We ran two different simulations, one in which we assumed millennials would have Social Security benefits and one in which they would not.
Data on median household income for all 15 cities comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 5-Year American Community Survey. We used that data to estimate monthly savings and retirement expenses.
We made several assumptions for both our simulations. To find monthly savings, we assumed that millennial households would save 7.5% of the median household income. We used 7.5% because that was the median savings rate for millennials (including employer match), according to Fidelity Investments' Retirement Savings Assessment study. To find the annual retirement expenses, we assumed that households would spend 25% less in retirement than they did in non-retirement. (We calculated non-retirement expenses to be all income not put toward savings i.e. 92.5% of income.)
We assumed that residents begin saving at the age of 27, are married, had no previous money saved, place all savings into a 401(k) and, for the first simulation, start take Social Security benefits at age 67. We also assumed a 4% return on savings and an annual inflation rate of 2%. Furthermore, we assumed that households had no additional savings or retirement accounts like an IRA.
The sole difference between the two simulation is that we removed Social Security payments as a factor for the second simulation.
Finally we plugged all this data into our retirement calculator to find the estimated age at which the average millennial would have enough money saved (combined with Social Security benefits and without Social Security benefits) to meet their expenses until the age of 95 in each of the 15 biggest cities.

Key Findings
1. California
California has the highest debt-to-income ratio in the country. Residents of the Golden State make about $28,000 annually on average, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The New York Federal Reserve Bank shows that Californians have a per resident debt balance of $65,740. This gives Californians a debt-to-income ratio of 2.34 on average. Like many other states, most of Californians’ debt is held up in their mortgages. Californians owe about $51,190 on their mortgages on a per capita basis.

2. Hawaii
Hawaii comes in second with a debt-to-income ratio of 2.1. On average Hawaiians make slightly more than Golden State residents. The median income in Hawaii is $31,905 as compared to $28,068 in California. Residents of Hawaii also have slightly more debt per capita than those in California: $67,010 to $65,740. Hawaiians have the second-highest proportion of debt tied up in mortgage. In total, $51,770 out of the total $67,010 in per capita debt that Hawaiians hold is owed on mortgages. That means 77% of per capita debt is mortgage debt.

3. Virginia
Virginia comes in third with a debt-to-income ratio just below 2. The average Virginian makes about $31,557 and has $62,520 in debt. One reason why lenders may feel safe lending to Virginians, allowing them to have a high debt-to-income ratio, is their low delinquency rates. Only 1.27% of mortgage debt in Virginia is delinquent by at least 90 days. That is the 13th-lowest rate in the country. Virginia also has a relatively high proportion of its debt in student loans (7.76%).

4. Colorado
Of Colorado’s total debt, 6.85% is tied up in automobile debt. That’s the second-highest rate in the top 10. However it is quite a bit lower than the national average of 9.57%. Overall there is not much separating Colorado from Virginia: Colorado has a debt-to-income ratio of 1.96. The median income in Colorado is $31,664 and the per capita debt is $62,200.

5. Utah

6. Washington, D.C.
Almost 15% of all debt held in the nation’s capital is owed on student loan debt. All that higher education may be paying off though. D.C. has the highest median income in the country and over half of the population over the age of 25 has at least a bachelor’s degree. In fact, there are more people over the age of 25 in D.C. with a graduate degree (32.3%) than there are with only a bachelor’s degree (23.8%). The capital also has the lowest percent of debt in the country tied up in auto loans (3.35%), probably due to the accessible public transportation available in the area.

7. Oregon

8. Washington
Washington, Oregon’s northwest neighbor, comes in eighth for highest debt-to-income ratio. The state has the third-lowest percent of debt tied up in student loans (6.29%) but the third-highest percent of debt tied up in mortgages (75.35%). Washingtonians also tend to be some of the most responsible holders of debt in the country. They rank above average in delinquency rates on all types of debt and rank in the top 10 for lowest rates of auto loan delinquency and credit card delinquency.

9. Massachusetts

10. Maryland
The Old Line State rounds out our top 10 states with the highest debt-to-income ratios. Maryland residents are some of the most well-off in the country, with an average individual income of $36,316. In terms of debt, Maryland residents have $67,020 in per capita debt, meaning their debt-to-income ratio is 1.84.

Data and Methodology 
In order to find the states with the most debt, SmartAsset gathered data on total debt per capita in every state (plus Washington, D.C.) and median individual incomes in every state (plus Washington, D.C.). To find the debt-to-income ratio in each state, we divided the 2015 total debt level per capita by the 2015 median individual incomes. We then ranked each state from highest debt-to-income ratio to lowest debt-to-income ratio.
Data for total debt per capita comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Data on median incomes comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 5-Year American Community Survey.

Drone footage captured a large shark lurking beneath the water, just feet away from two surfers who were none the wiser of the big fish.
Photographer David Finlay says he was operating his drone camera at a Kiami beach in the south-eastern region of Australia this week when he first spotted the dark figure moving in the water.

They can sense electromagnetic fields.
Some neuromasts are specialized to sense other changes in the environment. These are called ampullae of Lorenzini. Each ampullae works independently to distinguish the difference in electric potential in the environment versus in the shark's body.  Scientists think that this may allow sharks to detect prey, like muscle spasms originating from an injured fish, as well as predators, and mates. It is also thought that these ampullae may be responsible for detecting the Earth’s magnetic field, helping guide sharks during migration.
Researchers are also using what they know about this system to try and create new shark repellents.

Sharks can be hypnotized.
Technically, sharks can undergo what's called tonic immobility, or a natural state of paralysis. Researchers can induce this state in a shark by either flipping the animal onto its belly or rubbing its snout, depending on which species it is. Humans aren't the only ones who know how to use this trick. Scientists think large cetaceans, like whales, may use it as well to defend themselves or prey upon sharks (instead of grabbing hold of the dorsal fin, a larger marine animal would bite it). It may also be a tactic that sharks use on each other during mating to prevent injury to the female.

They're probably color-blind.
There are at least 440 known species of shark. Among such a diverse population, it’s impossible to say for sure that all of them are color-blind. But some research suggests that many are. All animal's eyes contain two different photo receptors, sensory cells that respond to light, known as rods and cones. Rods determine the light levels that can be recognized while cones control for color. A study of 17 different shark species found that although the animals can see at a huge range of light levels, they can only see at one color spectrum: Green. This is very rare in land animals, but common in other marine species such as whales, dolphins and seals.

But sharks have a crazy sense of smell.
Sharks are able to smell one drop of blood in 1,000,000 drops (26 gallons) of seawater.
Sharks' noses can detect tiny delays in how much time a smell reaches one nostril compared to the other. They use this as a directional cue and turn towards the side that received the smell first, allowing them to stay oriented.
(Photo by Philippe TURPIN via Getty Images)
There's HUGE variety amongst shark species.
Over 400 species of sharks have been discovered so far. The smallest of all sharks — the Pale Catshark — hardly looks like the monster you may have dreamt about. This little fellow scales in at a mere 8.3 inches!
On the other hand, the well-known Great White shark can reach up to 20 feet and weigh in at over 5,000 pounds.
But even the Great White pales in comparison to the Whale Shark, which reaches lengths of nearly 50 feet (about as long as a coach bus!) and weighs an astounding 47,000 pounds.
They have a weird way of sleeping.
Sharks are animals with gills, meaning that they must have constant water flow to take in oxygen and survive. This seems like a problem since they usually achieve this by constantly swimming. But all animals must rest.
Some sharks have special organs called spiracles behind the eye that pump water over the gills even while they're sitting still. Species that never evolved to have this helpful feature find solace in taking short breaks from swimming while sitting face-first in the current to allow continued oxygen uptake through the gills. 
(Photo via Getty Images)
The only bones sharks have are their teeth.
Like all vertebrates, sharks have a skeleton. The interesting thing about sharks is that theirs isn't made of bone. 
Unlike humans, sharks have a completely cartilagenous skeleton. This is the same stuff that makes up our ears and noses. This unique difference allows sharks to travel faster — important for hunting — since they can move their bodies without the rigidity of a bony vertebrate column. In the blink of a (human) eye, a shark can turn and bite a predator lurking at its tail. 
Cartilage is also a lot lighter than bone, aiding in buoyancy, or the shark's ability to stay afloat. Finally, it is much more durable to injury, which is a necessity in the predator-filled world that is the open ocean.

In the video, the shark is seen swimming harrowingly close to a surfer whose feet are dangling in the water.
The surfer was awaiting the next wave while the shark started to swim toward him and another surfer.
Finlay is heard asking his acquaintance for a phone, presumably to warn surfers of the shark, before the short clip ends.
"These surfers were completely unaware there was a shark swimming directly beneath their feet," Finlay said. "The surf lifesavers were notified there was a shark in the water."
Last year, 17 shark attacks were unprovoked.

Aside from traditional public high schools, parents may already be able to send their teens to charter schools – public schools run by independent organizations with more flexibility to experiment with how schools operate. There are also magnet schools, which are designed around a theme, like STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – and may attract more academically gifted students via an application.

U.S. News evaluated more than 28,000 public high schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Five hundred public high schools received gold medals, 2,109 took home silver and 3,432 received bronze in the national rankings.
First, U.S. News looked at student performance on state-required tests during the 2014-2015 school year. Schools had to perform better than statistically expected on these tests in their state, given their student poverty levels, to make it to the next step. Then, schools were evaluated on whether their least-advantaged students – those of black, Hispanic and low-income backgrounds – performed at or better than the state average.
The third step required schools that passed the first two steps to have a graduation rate of at least 75 percent. Those that did made it to the final phase – which determined if their national ranking was a gold, silver or bronze medal. In this fourth step, U.S. News looked at how well schools prepared students for college based on participation in and performance on Advanced Placement exams.
The top 25 nationally ranked high schools performed equally in this phase and a new tiebreaker process was used to determine their numerical ranks. The tiebreaker looked at the percentages of seniors who took and passed AP exams in at least four different subject areas – which showed how well students were prepared for college across a variety of disciplines.
The International Baccalaureate Organization was unable to provide U.S. News with IB data as it had in previous years for the final step, so schools only using IB exams weren't eligible to receive gold or silver medals. But like all high schools that pass the first three steps of the methodology, IB schools were eligible for bronze medals.
In a new feature to the rankings, some schools with bronze medals performed well enough on college readiness to be numerically ranked within their own state.

FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Leading French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign said on Friday it had been the target of a "massive" computer hack that dumped its campaign emails online 1-1/2 days before voters choose between the centrist and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen.
Macron, who is seen as the frontrunner in an election billed as the most important in France in decades, extended his lead over Le Pen in polls on Friday.
As much as 9 gigabytes of data were posted on a profile called EMLEAKS to Pastebin, a site that allows anonymous document sharing. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for posting the data or if any of it was genuine.
See Gallery
In a statement, Macron's political movement En Marche! (Onwards!) confirmed that it had been hacked.
"The En Marche! Movement has been the victim of a massive and co-ordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information," the statement said.
An interior ministry official declined to comment, citing French rules that forbid any commentary liable to influence an election, which took effect at midnight on Friday (2200 GMT).
The presidential election commission said in statement that it would hold a meeting later on Saturday after Macron's campaign informed it about the hack and publishing of the data.
It urged the media to be cautious about publishing details of the emails given that campaigning had ended, and publication could lead to criminal charges.
Comments about the email dump began to appear on Friday evening just hours before the official ban on campaigning began. The ban is due to stay in place until the last polling stations close Sunday at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
Opinion polls show independent centrist Macron is set to beat National Front candidate Le Pen in Sunday's second round of voting, in what is seen to be France's most important election in decades. The latest surveys show him winning with about 62 percent of the vote.
RUSSIAN HAND SEEN
Former economy minister Macron's campaign has previously complained about attempts to hack its emails, blaming Russian interests in part for the cyber attacks.
On April 26, the team said it had been the target of a attempts to steal email credentials dating back to January, but that the perpetrators had failed to compromise any campaign data.
The Kremlin has denied it was behind any such attacks, even though Macron's camp renewed complaints against Russian media and a hackers' group operating in Ukraine.
Vitali Kremez, director of research with New York-based cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, told Reuters his review indicates that APT 28, a group tied to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, was behind the leak. He cited similarities with U.S. election hacks that have been previously attributed to that group.
APT28 last month registered decoy internet addresses to mimic the name of En Marche, which it likely used send tainted emails to hack into the campaign's computers, Kremez said. Those domains include onedrive-en-marche.fr and mail-en-marche.fr.
"If indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome," Kremez said.
France is the latest nation to see a major election overshadowed by accusations of manipulation through cyber hacking.
U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of parties tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to influence the election on behalf of Republican rival Donald Trump.
On Friday night as the #Macronleaks hashtag buzzed around social media, Florian Philippot, deputy leader of the National Front, tweeted "Will Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?"
Macron spokesman Sylvain Fort, in a response on Twitter, called Philippot's tweet "vile".
En Marche! said the documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but that authentic documents had been mixed on social media with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation".
Ben Nimmo, a UK-based security researcher with the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank, said initial analysis indicated that a group of U.S. far-right online activists were behind early efforts to spread the documents via social media. They were later picked up and promoted by core social media supporters of Le Pen in France, Nimmo said.
The leaks emerged on 4chan, a discussion forum popular with far right activists in the United States. An anonymous poster provided links to the documents on Pastebin, saying, "This was passed on to me today so now I am giving it to you, the people."
The hashtag #MacronLeaks was then spread by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist whose Twitter profile identifies him as Washington D.C. bureau chief of the far-right activist site Rebel TV, according to Nimmo and other analysts tracking the election. Contacted by Reuters, Posobiec said he had simply reposted what he saw on 4chan.
"You have a hashtag drive that started with the alt-right in the United States that has been picked up by some of Le Pen's most dedicated and aggressive followers online," Nimmo told Reuters.
Alt-right refers to a loose-knit group of far-right activists known for their advocacy of extremist ideas, rejection of mainstream conservatism and disruptive social media tactics.

Sarah had been sent out to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles wearing an 'Anna' costume, tasked with finding a masked 'Kristoff' on the street.
"Now to make things more dramatic, Sarah and Michael have never been on a date before," Bell said while Sarah was out searching. "Sarah has no idea Michael is asking her to prom. This could go terribly wrong, but you've got to admit it would make great TV, right?"

The teen found the character and when she brought him back to the studio, she was surprised to find her classmate Michael in the suit.
"Sarah, there's something I wanted to ask you, but I didn't know the words, so Kristen Bell is going to help me," Michael said.

Sarah interrupted at that point, giggling as she grabbed the mic and said, "Yes!"
Bell set the pair up with a limousine on the big day, as weel as a glam session to help Sarah get ready and a tuxedo fitting for Michael.
"And a case of beer! I'm just kidding about the beer," Bell quipped. "Congratulations!"

"It's a joke in the neighborhood because every year [Nolan's friend] dresses up as a Klansman and he has two black grandchildren that he loves to death," Christian Dennery, a lawyer representing Nolan, said.
The lawsuit said the Trump campaign did not dismiss Nolan because he assured them he was not racist.

Cameras captured Culkin helping the 19-year-old light a cigarette before heading to Paris Blues, a jazz club in Harlem.
The duo are said to have left the spot at about 4 a.m.
Culkin, 36, and his goddaughter have a very close bond. The actor and her father were seemingly inseparable in the early 1990s.
After the "Billie Jean" singer's sudden death in 2009, the actor was there to show support for his grieving children.
Now, with her star on the rise — she reportedly just signed a multi-million dollar deal with Calvin Klein — she'll have her godfather by her side as she handles life in the spotlight.

A 25-year-old federal program that helps finance construction projects for historically black colleges and universities could be at risk under the Trump administration.
On Friday, President Trump signed a $1 trillion spending bill. In his statement, Trump referred to the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program Account as one example of programs that "allocate benefits on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender.
He goes on to say his administration will deal with such programs "in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment."
With those words, Trump seems to be calling the constitutionality of funding such programs into question, with the United Negro College Fund issuing a statement, saying it's "puzzled" by the provision.
Cheryl Smith, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the UNCF, told Politico the program Trump used as an example isn't based on race but on "mission, accreditation status and the year the institution was established."
University of South Carolina law professor Derek W. Black cautions that Trump's statement seemingly hinting at potentially defunding programs doesn't cite any legal proof that they are discriminatory.
Black also pointed out to Politico that religion or disability weren't included on the list, wondering why only "race, ethnicity and gender" were listed in the statement.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is embarking on an ambitious early childhood education plan to make full-day preschool free for all 3-year-olds regardless of family income by 2021.
"This is going to be a game-changer," the Democratic mayor said while announcing the plan Monday at a school in the Bronx.
The plan, dubbed 3-K for All, is intended to build on the city's ongoing efforts to provide prekindergarten education to all 4-year-olds through an initiative known as Pre-K for All, which the city says has more than tripled the number of 4-year-olds enrolled in pre-K education since it launched in 2014.
"This extra year of education will provide our children with a level of academic and social development that they cannot get later on, while at the same time, alleviating some of the strain New York City's working families face today," de Blasio said.
​​​​​​"Research shows children benefit more from two years of high quality pre-K than one year," says Abbie Lieberman, an early education policy analyst for Washington think tank New America. "There's been so much attention to pre-K for 4-year-olds, but very few have expanded access to 3-year-olds."
By the fall of 2018, officials hope to have a seat readily available for every 3-year-old living in those two districts, projecting an enrollment of about 1,800 children there – triple the number enrolled today, according to the mayor's office.
Providing free, full-day early education to every 3-year-old child in the city will save families approximately $10,000 in child care, according to the mayor's office and the New York City Center for Economic Opportunity, which also reportedly estimates that 1 in 4 families who take advantage of the benefit are likely to work an average of four more hours per week, resulting in an estimated $2,400 in additional income per family.
"The benefits of early care and education programs have a clear and measurable impact on the health and wellness of children and communities as a whole," Herminia Palacio, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services, said in a statement. "By introducing 3K for All and strengthening programs in the birth-to-5 continuum, New York City is ensuring that all children, including those who are most vulnerable, get a critical boost that will positively impact their lives for years to come."
"I'm happy to see they are implementing it a little more slowly than Pre-K for All," she says. "This would allow for more thoughtful implementation. Scaling up too quickly can jeopardize quality, and that was a big concern for Pre-K for All."

Mark Green, President Donald Trump's pick for Army secretary, withdrew his nomination Friday amidst criticism over his controversial statements about Islam, transgender rights and gay marriage.
Opposition to Green's nomination mounted over the last week, with multiple groups criticizing his controversial remarks and record.

"If you poll the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease," Green also allegedly said in September.
Green, a Republican state senator in Tennessee and former Army medic who did three tours in Iraq, rejected the criticism, saying that the "liberal left has cut and spliced my words about terrorism and ISIS, blatantly falsifying what I've said," CNN reported.
A number of US senators also called on President Trump to choose someone else. Most were opposed due to some of Green's controversial past comments.
Green said in a statement that those who opposed him were using "false and misleading attacks."
Trump's first pick for Army secretary was business executive Vincent Viola. He withdrew his consideration in February because of his financial holdings.

The federal budget in 2016 was $4 trillion, so $54 billion would be just about 1.35 percent of the budget that year.
Nonetheless, the number is really too big to fully comprehend, so to make it more manageable, here's what "We, the People," might get for $54 billion in defense spending. For the sake of comparison, we're going to throw in what we could do with that amount of money in non-defense spending, as well.
The U.S. plans to buy 2,457 of the planes.

Alternatively, the $54 billion could be applied to purchasing ammunition for one of the Zumwalt’s super high-tech guns. At a cost of $800,000 per shell, we could buy 67,500 of those.
The 5.56 mm round is most commonly used in the M-16 rifles, M-4 carbines and M-249 machine guns. According to U.S. Army budget documents, they cost $34.9 million in 2015, a figure that includes the standard ammunition used in training and combat, along with tracer rounds, test rounds and other types. The purchase is meant to procure ammunition to be used that year, along with some extra to maintain a war stockpile. At that rate of purchase, $54 billion worth would last 1,547 years. (Of course, that doesn’t account for the bullets used by other branches of the military.)

Kids go through all kinds of interesting stages in life. I find it interesting, and a bit entertaining, that my 7-year-old is now in that state where he's having conversations with his friends about more than just toys.
I can understand many of the reasons why parents start paying their child an allowance. It can help:
However, something inside me just wasn't buying it. I decided not to give my child an allowance for now. Here are 3 reasons why along with what I opted to do instead.
Right now, there's not a ton that my 7-year-old can do around the house. My husband and I do the cooking and cleaning. All my son needs to do is pick up his toys after himself, and make up his bed each day.
I've tried teaching him how to hang up his clothes and vacuum a bit, but he's not doing these things on a regular basis. Regardless, all of these chores listed are things he can do to help out and contribute to the family.
I don't think he should get paid for normal things he does around the house since because that could set him up for unrealistic expectations later on in life. My husband and I don't get paid to cook dinner and clean up the house.
My child is in a stage right now where he's interested in having money – to buy toys I'm guessing. He's not necessarily interested in doing his chores and helping out around the house. He's just looking forward to what's in it for him.
I actually see that as a bad sign. I don't want my son to be motivated to do things just for money.
There are many other benefits that come from doing chores and cleaning up, like having a neat home or room to enjoy, and avoiding clutter and pests that may show up when there are a ton of crumbs around.
I fear that if I start paying my child an allowance this early, he may not be motivated to help out and clean in general in the future if money isn't involved. It's important to teach my son that cleaning up is a natural habit that everyone should be happy to do regardless of if they're getting paid or not.
Some parents may argue that paying your child an allowance can help them learn about money. Without having money of their own how can they learn how to manage money properly? I don't entirely agree with this mindset.
Right now, I know that my son wants money so he can buy extra toys (that he doesn't really need). My husband and I get him plenty for Christmas and his birthday, and my mom gets him things occasionally.
Sure, I could probably give him a small allowance. Then I could teach him how to save a portion of the money instead of spending it. But, I can also teach him how to budget for real life expenses too.
I'm planning on giving him a budget for his birthday party next year. I'll let him pick everything out so I can actively show him how much things cost. I can also teach him about budgeting while we shop for food in the grocery store instead of just doing everything myself.
We can also discuss saving up for college. Plus, I really want to get him a stock gift card for Christmas so I can introduce investing.
Instead, I'm willing to give him money for going above and beyond my expectations. For example, if he were to get straight As in school in future years. I'm also okay with helping him collect spare change that's found around the house as an attempt to 'grow his savings'.
My husband and I are really bad about leaving spare change around and doing absolutely nothing with this. A few weeks ago, we decided to allow our son to put some of the spare change from around the house into his bank.
Quarters are off limits because we tend to use those for washing our clothes. But, as long as I approve it, anything else is fair game for his piggy bank. My hope is that collecting spare change will teach my son how to be resourceful in future years. He'll understand that all money is valuable and can add up.
Right now since my child has very few needs and plenty of time to learn more about money. I feel like this is the best solution for us.

A single conversation could be all you need to spot a psychopath.
1. They speak in the past tense. 
(PhotoAlto/Eric Audras via Getty Images)
(Bloom Productions via Getty Images)
3. Their language lacks emotional dimension.
For psychopaths, saying, "I love you," doesn't stir up any more emotion than saying, "Please pass the milk." They can parrot back what they've heard other people say but their facial expressions don't match their words. Their ability to verbalize feelings is most likely a learned behavior, as opposed to a genuine emotional experience.
(Fabrice LEROUGE via Getty Images)
Researchers have found that psychopaths talk more and use more emotional words in an attempt to gain attention and admiration. Psychopaths are really good at saying just the right thing at the right time. They know how to play on other people's emotions and they're master manipulators.
(Tom Merton via Getty Images)
5. They speak slowly and quietly.
Studies show psychopaths usually speak in a controlled manner. They don't emphasize emotional words like other people do. Their tone remains fairly neutral throughout the conversation. Researchers suspect they craft a calm demeanor intentionally because it helps them gain more control in their personal interactions.
(Ridofranz via Getty Images)
6. They talk about life in terms of cause and effect.
7. They focus their attention on their basic needs.
Rather than talk about spiritual or emotional needs or the needs of others, psychopaths are more likely to talk about their own basic needs, like food and shelter. A psychopath who confesses to a murder, for example, is more likely to spend the bulk of his time talking about what he ate for lunch and what he hoped to gain financially, rather than how his behavior affected other people.
8. They say, "um" more often.
9. They're great storytellers.
Whether a psychopath claims she rescued kittens from a burning building or says she was the only one at her last job who was willing to stand up to management, psychopaths tell rich stories about themselves. While some stories are likely to paint them as victims, the bulk of their stories are likely to portray them as heroes. All of their stories stem from their desire to gain trust and manipulate their listeners.

How Likely Are You to Talk to a Psychopath?
Before you start declaring everyone around is a psychopath, know that only about one in 100 people is likely to be one--unless you're talking to people in prison. Some experts estimate up to 25 percent of prison inmates may be psychopaths.
If you encounter a psychopath, don't panic. Most of them aren't serial killers. In fact, some of them are successful CEOs and business leaders. But knowing whom you are dealing with can prevent you from being manipulated.

Are you considering putting your home on the market? 2017 is turning out to be a great year for home sellers.

But remember to be realistic and respectful when asking an agent to drop their fee. Lewis explains:
It's not reasonable to ask a full-service agent to drop her fee to the level of, say, a discount brokerage like Redfin. If you can negotiate a discount of one entire percentage point, you've done great.

For the purposes of our study younger millennials are adults between the ages of 16 and 24 and older millennials are adults between the ages of 25 and 44.
The median household income for young millennials in San Francisco is $49,078. The marginal tax rate for single tax filers in California who earn between $40,773 and $51,530 is 8%. Combined with federal taxes, this results in a total estimated tax bill of $10,737.

9. San Jose, California
On average, a young millennial in San Jose pays more income taxes than his or her peers in San Francisco and Los Angeles. That’s because the median household income in San Jose for young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 ($49,595) is higher than it is in other major cities across the state of California. A typical young adult in San Jose who earns the median income pays $1,707 in state and local taxes and $9,240 in federal taxes.
8. Baltimore, Maryland

7. Aurora, Colorado
Aurora ranks seventh on our list of the places where younger millennials pay the highest taxes. Five-year estimates from the Census Bureau’s 2015 American Community Survey report that the median household income for 16- to 24-year old residents in the city is around $41,826. This means that a single filer earning median income can expect to pay about $7,417 in federal taxes and $1,937 in state and local taxes.

5. Virginia Beach, Virginia
Virginia Beach could be the perfect place to live if you like being in close proximity to the ocean. But if your income falls on the higher end of the spectrum, prepare to end up with a hefty tax bill. The federal effective tax rate for young millennials who earn the median income in Virginia Beach is 10.41%. Combined with state and local tax rates, that rate climbs to 22.7%, resulting in an estimated tax bill of $10,173 overall.
(SherryVSmith_Images via Getty Images)
4. Portland, Oregon
The median household income for a millennial between the ages of 16 and 24 is about $34,002, according to the Census Bureau. And while Oregon residents don’t have to worry about paying sales tax, many single filers face a steep marginal income tax rate of 9%. Based on our calculations, we found that a young millennial earning the median income in Portland can expect to pay about $5,645 in federal taxes and around $2,332 in state and local taxes.
(DaveAlan via Getty Images)
3. New York, New York
New York City is another city that’s notorious for its high tax rates. Our study reveals that a young millennial earning median income in the Big Apple (the average income across all five boroughs, based on population) would pay an overall effective tax rate of 24%. That adds up to about $9,138 in federal, state and local taxes.
(mikdam via Getty Images)
2. Chesapeake, Virginia
Census Bureau data reveals that the median household income for young millennials in Chesapeake is around $64,695. As a result, they have some of the highest tax bills among their counterparts nationwide. Our analysis shows that a young Chesapeake millennial earning median income will pay about $14,170 in federal taxes and around $3,227 in state and local taxes.

1. Arlington, Virginia

Our analysis reveals that six cities in our study (San Francisco, San Jose, Honolulu, New York, Arlington, Virginia and Portland, Oregon) rank as places where younger and older millennials pay the highest taxes. Older millennials also have high tax bills in six other cities, including Washington, D.C., Oakland and Fremont, California.
In terms of the cities where older millennials have the biggest tax burdens, we also had a three-way tie for 10th place. In Irvine, Santa Ana and Anaheim, California, older millennials who earn around $81,917 (the median household income for adults between the ages of 25 and 44) can expect to pay about $19,793 in federal taxes and $4,607 in state and local taxes.
Washington, D.C.
Oakland, California
Income tax rates in the state of California vary widely based on income. The poorest residents pay a marginal tax rate of 1% and the wealthiest residents face a marginal rate of 12.3%. In Oakland, the median household income for adults between the ages of 25 and 44 is nearly $90,500. Adults who earn the median income pay an overall effective tax rate of 30.9% (with federal taxes included).
Fremont, California
Fremont is located roughly an hour away from San Francisco, by car. The average older millennial earns around $90,499 per year and has a combined effective tax rate of 30.9%. That adds up to about $28,000 in federal, state and local taxes.
We made several assumptions throughout our study. For example, we assumed that a millennial would take the standard deduction and file taxes as a single filer claiming one exemption (meaning that he is not married and has no children). We also assumed that a typical millennial wouldn't make any pre-tax contributions to a 401(k) or another retirement account.

There isn't much North Korean media, but what little exists is full of images of nuclear destruction — of U.S. cities incinerated by North Korean nukes. News anchors promise that a coming conflict will leave Washington in "a sea of fire." A Communist party website warned Tuesday that Pyongyang is "waiting for the moment it will reduce the whole of the U.S. mainland to ruins."
North Korean propaganda has gotten so over-the-top that after that last headline, the Chinese urged the Koreans to pipe down. The Chinese Foreign Ministry suggested both the North and the U.S. should "remain calm and exercise restraint, stop irritating each other," which experts said was directed more at Pyongyang than D.C.

It all sounds very ominous, but is it? While the tempo of anti-U.S. rhetoric is higher than in past years, there hasn't been that much of a change in its content. As one U.S. intelligence official noted, there's always been "hyperbole and propaganda in their messaging."
In fact, say experts and U.S. officials, most of the rhetoric so widely replayed in Western media is not meant for the world stage but for internal consumption in the "hermit kingdom."
Still, at least one expert on North Korean propaganda said that while a lot of Pyongyang's rhetorical flourishes are "eminently mockable," they shouldn't be ignored.
1. While Kim Jong Un's birthday on January 8 is a national holiday, it is unknown exactly how old the North Korean leader is. It's widely believed he is in his early-mid thirties. In 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department listed his birth year as 1984 when they placed sanctions on North Korea.

Rodman has visited the secluded nation multiple times and even sang him "Happy Birthday" before an exhibition game in Jan. 2014.

5. Kim Jong Un's older half-brother Kim Jong Nam was killed in Feb. 2017 by two women who smeared VX nerve agent on his face at an airport in Kuala Lumpur. The women were arrested following his death. Many believe the hit was directed by North Korea.

"Their bluster now carries more weight," said Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo Korea Foundation Professor in Korean Studies at the Fletcher School. "We can patronize them, but when their ability to carry out such attacks gets close, when they show the technology, I think their threats become more credible."
Lee also said that outsiders "should not be reduced to patronizing a regime that is very cruel."
A second U.S. intelligence official said the recent increase in noise is about attention.
"They need it," said the official, noting they weren't getting it from the Obama administration. "So they've been pounding out stuff at a sustained pace for at least a year."
See Gallery
And the messaging can get even more personal. Lee points to attacks on President Obama and the recently impeached president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, in 2015. Obama, he said, was referred to as a "wicked black monkey" who should return to Africa "and feed off bread crumbs thrown by tourists" while Park was called a "dirty old whore." The North, Lee said, received criticism in the international community for its racist and sexist commentary.
Some of the more recent videos directed against the U.S. have high production values, with heavy use of graphics and animations.
One U.S. official said the videos are at once a throwback to earlier Cold War messaging and strangely au courant. He called them "almost post-modern, ironic rather than earnest."
There is a numbing sameness to North Korea's words and imagery, but the U.S. monitors the messages closely for any changes. As a second U.S. official said, if the Koreans stop talking about turning South Korea into a "sea of fire" and threaten something even more horrific, the intelligence community — and the world — need to take note.

Beyonce is setting the record straight on a report speculating that she got a cosmetic procedure done while pregnant with twins.
"What do you know about the effects of pregnancy on a woman's entire body? Please tell me," the statement reads, addressing the staffers at the website directly. "Did you know that in addition to weight gain there is often a dramatic change in the blood flow in the system and increased fluid causing swelling? Do you know that often women's gums get swollen? Do you know that it sometimes affects our speech, our ability to chew intently and a host of other things?"

"But the sacrifice to our faces, our feet and our entire bodies is something we welcome because we bring beautiful humans into the world who will one day combat your hate and negativity," the statement continues. "I stood silent during Beyonce's first pregnancy when you thought it was okay to bully her like the cowards you are, when you accused her of never being pregnant, but I simply cannot this time."
The statement ends with some even harsher words. "You are the saddest individuals and picking on a pregnant lady is tantamount to possessing the coldest, despicable heart," Noel-Schure says. "You need to find something else to do with your time and maybe stop by a store that has happiness on sale because you need to buy some.

Our daily life can be hectic and sometimes we long for convenient ways to save time and do less. Unfortunately, seeking convenience too often can cause you to overspend quite a bit.
Saving money is very convenient too and much better for your wallet and your financial goals. By planning ahead using savings strategies, we can save money on many daily purchases we tend to make and enjoy convenience in most cases. Let's put more money back into our pockets by saving money on these 50 common expenses many people tend to pay regularly.
Take a bit of extra time to withdraw money from your bank's ATM and save on the cost to withdraw your own cash or if your bank has a mobile app, use it to find an in-network ATM near you.
Many of us like to keep our loose change in a jar and let it collect over time. Once it's full, don't pay machines to count it for you, go to your bank to deposit your savings or have it exchange for cash.
Skip the line at the currency exchange or grocery store and pay online using checking account or debit card. Some companies charge to use a debit card, so schedule e-check payment, which is typically free.
Maintaining a balance on your card usually you to pay interest each month. Try to pay off your credit card balance in full each month or send more than the minimum payment. As always, use your credit cards responsibly.
I Raised My Credit Score By 150 Points, Here's How
Although it may be convenient, prices are always marked up when compared to other stores. So take the time to shop for food in advance at your grocery store and pack emergency snacks in your car.
Some vehicles may not require premium gas, which is the most costly of the gasoline grades. Stop trying to be fancy, check the owner's manual, and save.
You may not know this, but having low tire pressure affects your mileage significantly. Save gas and money by improving your gas mileage by simply checking your tire pressure and maintaining it at the proper level.
Many car wash places offer a flat monthly rate for unlimited washes, so check with your local car wash to find out if they offer a monthly rate and cash in on a clean car. Or, you can get a discount when you pump your gas.
According to the Powerball, the odds hitting the jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338.00, and CNN cites that Americans spent $70.15 billion in 2014. Let's save our hard-earned money.
A daily cup of joe adds up if you purchase it at places like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. Save by brewing at home.
It's a tough addiction to beat, but it is a very expensive to purchase cigarettes daily. Aside from causing deadly health effects, according to Time, smoking can cost you $1 to $2 million in a lifetime. Make an effort to better your health and wallet.
If your area doesn't charge for using plastic bags, reuse the ones you get from shopping as garbage bags. I do this all the time.
For those living in an area where stores charge for plastic bags (*cough cough Chicago*), bring your own reusable one. Those cents add up!
Reuse bags from previous occasions if they are still in good condition. We started doing this last year and no longer have to run out and by $3+ gift bags when we go to events or parties.
Take some time to make your own personal cards or send an eCard and skip on the expense.
For the frequent traveler, you should buy empty travel containers and refill with shampoo, lotion, etc. as needed.
Save money and paper by keeping up with free online news services.
In the digital age of music, don't pay for premium services. Streaming companies like SoundCloud and Spotify allow you to listen to music for free.
If you'd like to truly own a book, then save on the paper and extra cost by purchasing the digital version, or go to your local library and check them out for free.
Remember to return all materials on time. It'll save you money and allow for other library patrons to enjoy the material in a timely manner. If you do have library fees, wait for a month when they accept canned goods as a payment method (usually around the holidays).
Skip the early release and commotion of having the latest video game. Save major bucks by purchasing a used version of the game online or at stores like Game Stop.
Gaming apps are meant to entertain, and while most of them are free, don't fall for the "purchase bonus lives" trap. In-game purchases add up.
If you forget your charger and your phone needs to be charged, some time you'll be inclined to purchase a new one, but it can be costly or even poor quality. Always keep your charger handy, look for a charging station where you're at, or simply ask to borrow one.
Save on disposable batteries and purchase rechargeable ones. They can last up to two to three years.
Many offices, banks, insurance companies, etc, give them away for free. Save them and skip on the purchase.
Unless you're a student, you probably don't really need to buy a lot of paper – reuse already printed pages and use both sides.
While some families "grow into" their homes, sometimes less is more. Save on mortgage and the possibility of purchasing more for a larger home. Downsize and save.
If you pay for water utility bill, according to the EPA, fixing leaky faucets saves you 10% on your bill. By ignoring it, you not only lose money every day it goes unfixed, but you also waste clean water, at a rate of 10,000 gallons per year.
Save on heating and electric bills by fixing drafts and keep the warmth and cool in your home during the winter and summer.
Even though you may not use them often, electronics that are plugged in still consume energy. Unplug appliances you don't you often and keep other electronics on a power strip, turning them off when not in use.
Improve your health and wallet by not eating fast food often. It may be cheap, but it adds up, especially if you eat out a few times per week. Instead, spend the money and the time to grocery shop and prepare meals.
Sometimes you're running late for work and don't have time to pack a lunch. Buying lunch often costs much more than preparing and bring a meal to work. Spend some time planning, purchasing and preparing meals ahead of time so they're ready to go, even when you're in a hurry.
When you do go grocery shopping, sometimes the already-prepped sub or diced fruits and veggies tempt you to buy them and save time, but you'll be paying top dollar for those products. Plan a list ahead of time and buy the individual food items, then spend the time prepping them yourself in order to save.
Save money by skipping on the brand names, like medicine, toiletries, and certain foods. Remember that healthier options with fewer additives may cost more and in that case they may be worth it. Otherwise, generic is the way to go.
Products like toilet paper and soap have a long shelf life, so save on purchasing those often and buy in bulk.
You are purchasing these to eventually throw them out. Save on the waste and save money by buying reusable, washable towels and napkins. Your wallet and the environment will thank you.
Primetime showings are typically 2x higher than those during the day. Go to morning matinees or take advantage of weekly specials ($5 movie nights during the week).
Often times, movie theater food can cost more than the ticket to get in. Try to keep food purchases to a minimum when you can or eat a filling meal before you go see a movie.
Instead of spending money on purchasing the movie, subscribe to streaming services and find an alternative or go to your local library.
While having a spontaneous night out is fun, if you RSVP when possible, arrive early, or take advantage of online ticket sales, you can skip out on paying in full at your favorite nightlife places.
Your birthday is one of the best days to score free stuff like meals, drinks, desserts, tickets, services, etc. I wrote a whole roundup post on birthday freebies a while ago.
When you do dine out and if you have kids with you, be sure to take advantage of 'kids eat free' specials. Most restaurants have specific days of the week when they offer free kids meals.
You may not be able to cut out this expense completely if you have pets, but you can score free cans of pet food with coupons occasionally so you won't have to spend as much.
As you can see, there are many ways to save big on everyday expenses. How do you plan on cutting back and keeping more money in your wallet?

Matus and DeVoursney, a former Marine from Georgia, were found dead Monday in Belize. Authorities in the Central American country have named 54-year-old John Deshaies as the prime suspect.
But the friend of the suspected killer says police have the wrong man. The friend said Deshaies, the owner of a Canadian construction company, would never harm Matus.
The friend believes police targeted Deshaies because he left the country shortly after Matus and DeVoursney went missing.
Deshaies lived in the lower half of Matus' home in Belize. Matus, 52, was a Canadian real estate investor and split her time between Belize and Canada.
"Belize is a very corrupt country," the friend said. "I think they're actually keeping him in jail for his own safety. They want it to seem like it's a Canadian or American problem rather than a Belizean one."
DeVoursney, 36, and Matus, who had only been dating for a few months, were last seen alive at Scotty's Bar and Grill in Corozal. They were found dead in a field near the village of Chan Chen a week after they disappeared.
It was determined that Matus and DeVoursney had been strangled.

That doesn't mean some — like Bill Maher — aren't ready to lob some criticism, not necessarily at Kimmel but more at the ideas he presented. Thankfully, it has nothing to do with Kimmel's situation with his son — it would take a real heel to criticize that on television — but Maher does take exception with Kimmel's assertion that all sides land along the same lines on basic healthcare. When Kimmel says Republicans and Democrats all agree that "If your baby's going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make," Maher stops his audience from applauding and proceeds to rant:
"Unfortunately that's not true, One side wants to tax rich people so that babies don't have to die and one side is mostly against that. And this lets Republicans off the hook...
"Let's not f*ck around with this, we are not on the same page with this."
See photos of Bill Maher:
See Gallery
Maher sprinkled healthcare talk throughout Friday's show, kicking things off with a monologue that made fun of the celebration in The White House rose garden and saying that the GOP told Jimmy Kimmel's baby "go screw yourself." It also led to Maher dropping a New Rule that called out the folks who characterized the 2016 election as a "choice between the lesser of two evils." He includes plenty of other examples from Trump's first 100 days, including his many questionable cabinet positions, and proceeds to lecture all of the major names that seemed to put Clinton in the same basket with Trump.

Former first lady Michelle Obama recently revealed a surprising behind-the-scenes look at how her daughters decided to spend their last moments in the White House.
After enjoying a long vacation with husband and former president Barack Obama in the Virgin Islands, Michelle Obama returned with her first official public appearance since the Obamas left the White House three months ago at the American Institute of Architecture conference.
See Gallery
There, she shared how Malia and Sasha Obama -- 18 and 15 respectively -- bid farewell to their home of eight years. According to the first lady, they hosted a slumber party with friends, pizza and chicken nuggets.
"They had a sleepover, because of course on Inauguration Day, because my girls are so normal, they're like, 'Well, eight girls are gonna be sleeping here because it's our last time, and we want pizza and we want nuggets.' And it's like, really?," Michelle Obama said during the Thursday conference.
In reflecting on the girls' last night before Trump's inauguration, Obama said it was difficult for the girls to say goodbye to the White House.
"So that moment of transition, right before the doors opened and we welcomed in the new family, our kids were leaving out the back door in tears, saying goodbye to people," Obama said.
Obama joked that she had to maintain good face while welcoming the Trump family into the White House.
"I didn't want to have tears in my eyes because people would swear I was crying because of the new president," she said.
Obama also shared a funny note when reflecting on the Obama family's life outside of the White House.
"Friends are surprised I answer the door now," she explained, while also sharing that the Obama family's two furry members, dogs Bo and Sunny, have never even "heard a doorbell."

Ah, summer, you've been missed. We've been, er, itching for warmer days, weekend getaways and patio barbecues. Our days are soon to be exploding with afternoon happy hours, days on the lake, outdoor concerts and time with family and friends. If you couldn't tell, we cannot wait for summer to officially start.
Although most POW cases have been reported in the Great Lakes and Northeast, everyone should know how to protect themselves from ticks. From the type of socks to wear to the types of flowers to plant, here's how you can protect yourself.
1. Stay in the middle of the path
When hiking, make sure to stay in the middle of the path. Weeds, grass and trees make it easier for ticks to crawl onto you. Don't venture out to the grass or bushes, where ticks are formidable to be hiding. 
2. Wear long pants and closed toed shoes
Protect your skin. Adding an extra layer makes it more difficult to latch on to you. It's smart to wear pants, long sleeves and hats, especially in the summer.
3. Invest in deer-resistant plants. 
7. Stay in the sun.
5. Yes, repellant can help. 
4. Check your dog! 
Dogs can literally bring ticks right to your front door. Prevent ticks by keeping their coats short in the summer. Use your hands to check the fur, stopping if you feel a pea-sized bump. Favorite spots ticks like to hide include the ears, toes and under the tail. 
6. Dry your clothes 
Warning: Ticks can survive the wash. 
8. Tuck your pants into your socks.
This covers the small, easily accessible space in between your pants and ankles. Especially if you are sitting, it makes it easier for ticks to latch on. 
9. Invest in Permethrin socks
10. Mow your lawn
Cut your grass, clean your yard, get rid of any extra firewood or wood chips.

At 23 years old, zookeepers say an African elephant named Seeni is expecting and due this summer. Seeni was rescued from Botswana, along with two other females, and the handlers have been waiting for her to get pregnant.

Pittsburgh Zoo staff are thrilled at the news as her calf will be the first born at the facility since it opened in 2006. Even with good news, keepers say Seeni's is a high-risk pregnancy.

Tiny homes might seem ideal for those seeking a quieter, quainter lifestyle.
But imagine a tiny home being thrown in the middle of all the madness that is downtown Las Vegas — in the backyard of one of the most infamous party hotels, no less.
Though it might not be the source of rest and relaxation that most crave from tiny living, if there's anywhere to try something completely unorthodox, it's certainly Vegas!
The room boasts one bedroom with a queen-sized bed, a lofted full-sized bed and a pullout sleeper sofa, which allows the place to comfortably (questionable) sleep six guests.
See Gallery
If you're still not sold, get this — the home essentially doubles as a private "island" in the middle of an all-night party.
The structure is set up in "The Backyard" courtyard property of the Gold Spike hotel (the hotel's penthouse was the suite featured on MTV's "Real World" Season 31) which is essentially an adult dreamland — giant yard games like cornhole and Jenga, a music stage and of course, a bar.
"During the day, The Backyard is relatively tame. At night, however, the area can get downright rowdy—and the Sugar Shack is right in the center of the action."
Renting the Sugar Shack also means gaining access to a private front yard, essentially enabling VIP access to all of the festivities going on around you.
The countless windows and open air vibes of the structure always make you feel like you're the center of the party, even when you're just hanging out inside — and isn't that what most come to Vegas for, anyway?
Goes without saying that all guests must be 21 or older.
It's definitley not for the faint of heart, but for those wanting a through and through Las Vegas experience, this might be as close as you'll ever get — you truly never have to leave the party.

Big-box stores and warehouse clubs like BJ's, Costco and Sam's Club are a shopper's dream -- One-stop shops where you can buy a lifetime supply of your favorite foods and products. However, don't let every gargantuan carton and low price tag tempt you. Tons of items are better purchased in a 2-pack rather than a 24-pack.
1. Cooking oils
Cooking oils like olive oil and vegetable oil typically have shelf lives of only 6-12 months -- so stay away from the gallon-sized containers. 
2. Spices
While spices don't expire quickly, they tend to lose their potency after about 6 months. If you want to buy spices in bulk, stick to buying whole cloves and grind them up yourself to maintain those bold flavors. 
3. Liquid bleach
Bleach has a shelf life of about 6-12 months. The chemical begins to degrade immediately, especially at higher temperatures, so don't be tempted by the bigger packages.
4. Face cream and sunscreen
Lotions like moisturizer and sunscreen  tend to lose their effectiveness in about 3-6 months -- so stick to purchasing smaller bottles and restock a few times a year. 
5. Condiments
Condiments like ketchup, ranch dressing and mayonnaise are laden with preservatives to hold a longer shelf life -- but even so, it's usually 6-12 months. There's a good chance you won't finish your bottle before the expiration date, so stick to buying one bottle at a time. 
6. Brown rice
Brown rice deteriorates much faster than white or pre-cooked rice. Even when stored in an airtight container, brown rice only has a shelf life of about 6 months. 
7. Soda
Properly stored canned soda has a shelf life of about 9 months, but it may lose some carbonation and taste.
See Gallery
Be cautious in the cooking aisle. Cooking oils have a much shorter shelf life than you probably realize (only 3-6 months!) and ground spices lose their potency after about 6 months. White rice and other pre-cooked rices reportedly have a shelf life of 30 years -- but did you know brown rice expires after only 6 months?
Besides the obvious grocery staples that perish quickly -- like dairy products, produce and meat -- there are some other products to avoid buying in large quantities that you may not be aware of.
Hit up the grocery store instead for the above items -- or just stick to smaller packages.

No more Twitter for Kanye.
"He's focusing on getting back into the public spotlight really slow," a source told ET earlier this week. "That's the main reason why he didn't want to go to the Met Ball. He's still very close friends with Anna and loves her dearly, but right now it's all about him and staying healthy."

"He was thrilled that Kim was able to go and have fun," the source said. "But him staying at home with his children was something he wanted to do more."
Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian West, did go solo to the event, where she rocked a subdued white outfit, and confirmed her husband's absence from the event.

According to Allard, drug paraphernalia and prescription medication was located in the home near McNeely's body. There is no indication of foul play, however, Allard says there were signs of illegal drug use. McNeely's body has been transported to the West Virginia Medical Examiner for autopsy.

More than one-third of Americans say President Donald Trump is influencing how and where they decide to open their pocketbook.
"We may have lost at the ballot box, but we can vote at the cash register every day. I'm going to continue to reach out to these companies to let them know I'm not doing business with them until they sever their relationship with the Trump family."
Twenty-six percent of those who participated in the CNBC poll say they've made a political or charitable contribution based on Trump, CNBC reports, noting that "the vast majority" of those contributions are in opposition to the president.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Boko Haram militants have released dozens of schoolgirls out of a group of more than 200 whom they kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok in April 2014, officials said on Saturday.
A government minister, asking not to be named, said 82 girls had been released. Unconfirmed reports on social media put the number of freed girls at between 50 and 62.
"The girls were released through negotiations with the government," one official said, asking not to be named, adding that an official statement would follow shortly.
A military source said the girls were currently in Banki near the Cameroon border for medical checks before being airlifted to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.
The kidnapping was one of the high-profile incidents of Boko Haram's insurgency in Nigeria's northeast, now in its eighth year and with little sign of ending. About 220 were abducted from their school in a nighttime attack.
More than 20 girls were released last October in a deal brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Others have escaped or been rescued, but 195 were believed to be still in captivity before this release.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said last month that the government was in talks to secure the release of the remaining captives.
Although the Chibok girls are the most high-profile case, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of adults and children, many of whose cases have been neglected.
The militants have killed more than 20,000 people and displaced more than 2 million during their insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria.
Although the army has retaken much of the territory initially lost to Boko Haram, large parts of the northeast, particularly in Borno state, remain under threat from the militants. Suicide bombings and gun attacks have increased in the region since the end of the rainy season late last year.

A furry suspect caught on camera holding what appeared to be an assault rifle was lucky after escaping police by a whisker.
An Oregon resident alerted police after spotting a cat holding what appeared to be a firearm in its paws while posted up in a tree.

Police rushed to the scene to answer the bizarre call after receiving an image of the feline suspect toting the alarming object.
Once they arrived, law enforcement officials soon realized the photo of the would-be gangster puss was nothing more than an optical illusion.
The cat snapped in the photo was actually holding a tree branch that just looked a lot like a weapon, and the Newport Police Department reacted in style.
In a post on Facebook, the department wrote they issued the animal a "verbal warning."
Reports of an armed cat this morning were unfounded. The feline was contacted by our canine and was determined to be in...

Paying taxes on Earth is already a pain, but in California, you could one day be paying that extra fee in space. The state's franchise tax board wants the public to weigh in on the idea.
Its proposal would compute taxes on commercial space transportation companies. Basically, any company operating in California that makes half of their money from space transportation. They say it is any travel 62 miles above the surface of the Earth.
Alabama residents pay less in property taxes than residents in any other state due to low median home values and the second-lowest property tax rate. Alabama residents have 23.66 percent of income going toward taxes, with a median household income of $44,509.
Arizona falls in the bottom half of states for total taxes paid by its residents, who see 24.58 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes. Property taxes and gas taxes paid in this state are lower than the national average.
Arkansas has one of the highest sales tax rates in the nation, at 9.3 percent. However, residents pay less in income taxes and gas taxes than the national average. Plus, the average property tax bill in Arkansas is among the lowest in the nation due to low median home values and a low tax rate.
California residents pay more in taxes than residents of most other states. In fact, 31 percent of their income, on average, goes toward taxes. Considering that the cost of living in California also is high, it's no wonder it's one of the states where residents are most likely to live paycheck to paycheck, according to one GOBankingRates study.
Colorado residents pay more in taxes than the national average of $14,998.83 — and pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes, on average. The reason: high income and sales taxes. Gas and property taxes paid in Colorado, on th other hand, are lower than the national average.
Connecticut residents pay more in income taxes than any other state, in part due to a high median income of $72,889. Average property taxes paid in the state also are about double the national average of $2,118.08. In addition to high taxes, residents also are faced with a high cost of living in Connecticut.
Delaware is one of the most tax-friendly states, with residents paying just 21.99 percent of their income toward taxes. One of the key reasons the total tax bill is low here is because there is no sales tax. Plus, the average property tax paid is nearly half the national average.
Washington, D.C., residents pay more in property taxes, on average, than residents in most states due to a high median home value of $540,400. Residents also pay more in income taxes, on average, than any other state, with the exception of Connecticut.
On the plus side, the sales tax rate of 5.75 percent is below the national average. Residents also pay less than the national average to fill up their gas tanks.
The total taxes paid in Georgia are lower than the national average of $14,998.83. However, taxes actually consume a higher percentage of residents' income than the national average because of a low median income of $50,768 in the state.
Hawaii residents have to pay a hefty tax bill to live in paradise. Total taxes paid are among the top 10 highest in the nation — due, in large part, to high income taxes. Residents earning a median household income of $64,514 pay around $14,798.36 in income taxes.
On the plus side, property and sales taxes in Hawaii are lower than the national average.
Total taxes paid in Idaho — $14,012.17 — are slightly below the national average. However, residents pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes than the national average due to the state's low median income.
Hefty property and sales taxes contribute to a high total tax bill in Illinois. In fact, the average property tax bill is more than 50 percent higher than the national average — even though the median home value is below the national average. Overall, Illinois residents pay nearly 30 percent of their income, on average, toward taxes.
Indiana is a relatively tax-friendly state. The average total tax bill is lower than the national average because income and property taxes are lower in Indiana than in most other states.
Average property taxes paid in Kansas are relatively low due to a less-than-stellar median home value. Average income taxes paid also are below the national average because of the state's low median wage. However, Kansas residents are hit by a high sales tax, which is 8.62 percent versus the national average 6.47 percent.
Kentucky has the fourth-lowest average tax burden in this study. All taxes paid — income, sales, property and gas — are well below the national average. Income and property taxes paid are particularly low, on average, due to the state's low median income and property value.
Average property taxes paid in Louisiana are among the lowest in the nation, as are income taxes due to the state's low median income of $45,922. Further, Louisiana has a higher-than-average sales tax of 9.98 percent.
Total taxes paid in Maine are lower than the national average. But that doesn't mean residents don't face high taxes. Total taxes paid consume nearly 27 percent of residents' pay, on average, due to the state's low median income.
Maryland residents pay more in taxes than residents in all but three states. This is largely due to the high income taxes paid in this state, which has the third-highest median income in the nation.
Michigan's property tax rate is higher than the national average. However, a low median home value helps keep down the average property taxes paid in the state. Income and sales taxes paid also are lower than the national average.
On average, nearly 30 percent of what Minnesota residents earn goes toward income, property, sales and gas taxes. Average income taxes paid are particularly high, compared with other states.
Mississippi residents pay the lowest total tax bill in the nation. Income taxes paid here are the second lowest in the country due to the state's low median income of $40,037. Plus, property taxes paid are among the lowest in the nation as a result of a low tax rate and median home value.
The total tax bill in Missouri is only slightly higher than the national average of $14,998.83, due to income and sales taxes that are higher than the average paid nationwide. However, property and gas taxes in Missouri are well below the national average paid.
Montana is just one of four states with no sales tax. Property and income taxes also are lower than the national average. As a result, Montana residents see just 22.28 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes.
The total tax bill in Nebraska is higher than the national average. In large part, it's because residents pay more in income taxes as a result of a higher-than-average median income. Nonetheless, residents pay, on average, an amount equal to about 28 percent of their income.
New Hampshire has no sales tax. It also doesn't have a state income tax, but the average amount of federal income taxes paid by residents is high because the state has the highest median income in the nation. Residents also pay more in property taxes than the national average paid. In fact, New Hampshire has the second-highest property tax rate in the U.S., after New Jersey.
New Jersey residents pay the highest total tax bill in the nation. They also pay the highest percentage of income toward taxes — 33.17 percent, on average. The biggest reason the tax burden is so high in New Jersey is the state's 2.13 percent property tax rate, which is more than twice as high as the national average rate.
Total taxes paid in New Mexico are among the lowest in the nation. Property and income taxes paid are well below the national average. This is due, in large part, to a low median income and a low median home value in the state.
Like their New Jersey neighbors, New York residents pay more than 30 percent of their income toward taxes. Residents pay a lot on the state's high sales tax of 8.49 percent and property tax of 1.38 percent.
The total tax bill in North Carolina is lower than the national average thanks to lower-than-average property and income taxes. However, residents pay more in gas taxes.
North Dakota residents have a lower total tax bill than the national average, paying around $13,381.61 every year. Gas and property taxes are lower than the national average, too.
Although the property tax rate in Ohio is higher than the national average, property taxes paid fall below the national average due to the state's low median home value of $125,300. Ohio residents also pay slightly less in income taxes overall, forking over just under $9,000 annually.
Oklahoma has one of the lowest total tax bills in the nation. Income and property taxes are well below the national average because median income and the median home value are among the lowest in the U.S. However, residents are hit by a high 8.86 percent state sales tax.
Oregon is just one of four states without a sales tax. Still, residents pay just over 28 percent of their income toward taxes. They face a high income tax bill.
Rhode Island residents pay over 29 percent of their income toward taxes. The big tax bite is due primarily to the state's high property tax rate of 1.51 percent. Income and sales taxes, on the other hand, are on par with the national average.
South Carolina's total tax bill is among the lowest in the nation. Residents pay below-average income, gas and property taxes. Its sales tax, however, is above average at 7.22 percent.
South Dakota has no income tax, which helps keep residents' total tax bill below the national average. Property and sales taxes paid also are slightly below the national average.
Tennessee has no state taxes on income, but it makes up for it with a high sales tax rate of 9.46 percent — the second highest in this study. The average property taxes paid, on the other hand, are half the national average.
The overall tax bill in Utah is higher than the national average due to high income taxes paid by residents. However, the state does offer a high median household income of about $66,000. Meanwhile, the state's property tax rate is just 0.64 percent, compared to the national average of 1.02 percent.
Vermont residents pay more in property taxes than residents in most other states. As a result, total taxes paid in this state nearly top $18,000, far higher than the national average.
Virginia residents have a higher income tax bill than the national average, paying just over $12,600. But it's due, in part, to the state's median income, which is higher than the national average. Sales, gas and property taxes are all lower than national averages.
Washington has no income tax. However, residents are liable to pay a lot in income taxes thanks to the state's high median household income of $67,243. The state sales tax is also high, at 8.92 percent.
The total tax bill in West Virginia is the second lowest in the nation, after Mississippi. The typical property tax bill is also the second lowest in the nation, due to the state's low property tax rate of 0.53 percent and a low home value of $102,400.
Wisconsin residents pay a higher overall tax bill than the national average because of the state's high income and property taxes. In fact, Wisconsin is among the top 10 states that take the most out of your paycheck.
Residents of this tax-friendly state pay only about 20 percent of their income toward taxes — the lowest percentage in the nation. Wyoming has no state income tax, and property and sales taxes in the state are well below national averages.

Now, the reason the board created the rules is to let entrepreneurs know the state's tax code will be ready once business takes off. And, figuring out the amount of tax is actually pretty simple. The farther away from Earth you go means the less tax you pay. While the closer you are means more tax.
A public hearing on the rules is set for June 16th.

Cyrus says making the change was "easy." "When I want something, it's f–king easy for me," she said. "But if anyone told me not to smoke, I would have not done it. It's because it was on my time. I know exactly where I am right now."
Though she made this decision to quit "for a second" for herself, she was motivated in part by the people around her.

I want to be super clear and sharp because I know exactly where I want to be."

Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd said that the C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, is set to become the new star of its 600-plus aircraft fleet, stating that its "safety and state-of-the-art design will bring superb a flying experience to its passengers".
In a written reply to China Daily, the Shanghai-based airline, which is expected to be the first carrier to take delivery of the homegrown single-aisle passenger jet, said it was "extremely confident about the future of the C919".
China Eastern pre-ordered 20 C919s from the aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd in 2010, and according to the purchase agreement, negotiations for the ordering of the first five planes will be launched within a year of the C919's maiden flight.
China Eastern is one of the nation's top three airlines, serving more than 100 million passengers in flights to 177 nations and regions in 1,062 destinations every year.
ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, the subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, announced its intention to purchase 45 C919 aircraft in October 2011. ICBC Financial Leasing is looking to support COMAC with joint marketing, market surveys, signing more orders and all-around financial services in the future, said Xu Qing, deputy CEO of ICBC Leasing.
"C919 will serve the most attractive market. The aircraft will be used in the domestic market, the Asia-Pacific region and the African market in its early days. By continuously optimizing the aircraft's performance, the C919 will go global in the future," said Xu.
With regard to the two dominant commercial aircraft makers－Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE－she suggested the future C919 should pay more attention to service at the beginning to build up its brand first.
"It's important to pay attention to customer support and services, and enhance product quality and stability. Overseas marketing should be based on continuously optimized products and services, an efficient maintenance support, and efficiency of operations," said Xu.

A visitor poses for a photo on the glass bridge, in August. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
Editor's note: During the just-concluded May Day holiday, "glass paths" became the new buzzword in the tourism sector. Two experts share their views with China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang on the mushrooming of glass-bottomed walkways over gorges in scenic spots across China.
Are the 'glass paths' worth the trouble?




Glass-bottomed bridges were first built between two cliffs so that people could enjoy the scenery around while being aware of the scary depth of the ravine below. For example, in Baishi Mountain Geological National Park in Baoding, North China's Hebei province, a 95-meter-long, 2-meter-wide glass-bottomed walkway was built at an average altitude of 1,900 meters to allow visitors to experience the beautiful but stomach-churning scenery below.
The problem is that glass-bottomed walkways have mushroomed across China. Search glass-bottomed walkways on domestic tourism website tuniu.com, and you will find that 24 cities have built such "glass paths" as their tourist sites. And since a majority of the "glass paths" have been built across valleys bereft of natural beauty, one cannot but question the wisdom to build them.
The rush to build "glass paths" shows the officials in the domestic tourist sites lack creativity. Instead of using the inherent advantages of the tourist sites, they are busy copying ideas and examples from others. Such homogenization fails to meet tourists' diversified demands.
More importantly, the glass needed for the glass-bottomed walkways is expensive and the total cost of such a bridge can run into several million yuan, and some tourist sites may fail to earn enough revenue to cover the expenses, let alone make profits, which would be a waste of tourism resources. And any compromise with the quality of the glass or the overall glass-bottomed bridge could spell trouble.
Liu Simin, vice-president of tourism at Beijing-based Chinese Society for Future Studies
Such bridges need total safety system
No major accidents have been reported from glass-bottomed walkways. And many tourism sites claim double-or multi-layered armored glass, which is three to four times stronger than ordinary glass, have been used to build such walkways.
But good safety records do not necessarily guarantee safety in the future. There is a national standard for the glass used in outer parts of structures (as a curtain wall for a building for example) but no special standard for the glass used in glass-bottomed walkways. I do not mean to raise unnecessary alarm, but without a national standard no one can ensure safety forever on the "glass paths".
Besides, people tend to equal the risk with glass-bottomed bridges to the cracking of glass and people falling into the ravines. But that is not the only risk.
On April 9, the overcrowding on a glass-bottomed bridge in Mulanshengtian tourism zone in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, amidst heavy rainfall caused an accident in which one person died and three were injured. The incident should be a lesson for us. Regular safety checks must be conducted to test the strength and durability of such walkways, while the maintenance and supervision staff should be fully trained to know under what conditions the walkways should be closed and how to deal with emergencies.
Besides, not everybody is fit to walk on such "glass paths", because looking down into a deep ravine might raise a person's blood pressure, increasing the risk of a heart attack. In fact, several reports have said tourists started crying out in fear on such walkways. The tourist sites with such walkways should therefore display clear safety instructions so that visitors know the risks and people with unfavorable health conditions stay away from them.
Only a comprehensive safety system can ensure tourists' safety on glass-bottomed bridges.

WITH THE PRICE OF GARLIC SPROUTS plummeting due to oversupply, some farmers in Henan province have reportedly discarded their harvest of garlic sprouts, a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Thursday:
The local governments in Henan have acted quickly to the overstock by pledging to set up a garlic association to nip oversupply in the bud. But what happened in Henan indicates once again how easy it is for farmers to fall prey to price fluctuations.
That some have urged the market to play its part at the cost of "non-market minded" farmers is hardly helpful. Farmers do not necessarily have to pay the price for being unaware of how the market works and when they should increase or reduce their production. Local agricultural officials are obliged to intervene if need be and guide farmers through these dark waters, rather than sit on the sidelines.
The roller coaster price alterations of Chinese agricultural products can be devastating to farmers, yet they are not uncontrollable.
Home to a relatively mature and stable agricultural market, the United States can offer a lesson or two on balancing supply and demand.
The food produced by one US farmer can feed about 155 people, and one-fifth of the country's food products are exported to the rest of the world. In recent decades, the US has rarely suffered from an excessive supply of soybeans, oranges, or milk thanks to its efficient supply chain, at the core of which is its agricultural cooperatives.
Cooperatives enable farmers to own and control, on a democratic basis, the procurement of supplies and services, and the selling of their products.
This should be heeded by many local governments in China, which either step back letting the market take over or improvise countermeasures such as initiating emergency buying in the face of an oversupply. Neither approach is a cure to the problems facing Chinese farmers.
The nationwide promotion of cooperatives seems to have yet to reach Henan's local governments, which only began discussing the possibility of establishing a garlic association after farmers threw their hard-earned harvest away.
Establishing online exchange platforms could also better prepare farmers for unexpected market changes.

PARIS - The French electoral commission, which supervises the country's presidential race, on Saturday warned local media not to republish data and information hacked from centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign staff.
In a statement, the commission asked media not to report the content of the leaked documents on their websites, stressing that publishing false information would be punished under criminal law.
Late on Friday, Macron's campaign team said it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
The leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, it added.
However, the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation," according to Macron's En Marche! (On the Move!) party.
The alleged hacking of the leading political party in the presidential race came on the eve of the election's run-off on Sunday.
Pollsters predict Macron to beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen with large margin.
In February, Macron's staff said their campaign had been the target of cyber attacks targeting databases and e-mail servers.

Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia, on Wednesday.Alexander Zemlianichenko / Reuters
SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions."
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back".
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors.
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being.
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions.
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership."
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.

BEIJING - Chinese fans applauded Yao Ming's moving up on world basketball ladder when the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) president entered the top executive branch of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).
The NBA Hall of Famer became the co-opted Central Board member along with Russian Basketball Federation head Andrel Kirilenko as the Board held its second meeting of 2017 in Hong Kong, China on Wednesday.
The news reached his home country a day later and fans gave him the thumbs-up.
"Congratulations, Yao! You have my full support!" acclaimed one netizen.
"Yao Ming's appointment can get 100 'likes' from me. Besides, his appointment will be good for Chinese basketball and helps balance the sport's development worldwide," said another.
The Board plays a role in supervising the practice of basketball worldwide where Yao will start his term on October 1.
Used to be the face of Chinese sports, Yao, 37, has made successful transition from the Chinese international and Houston Rockets center to businessman, political adviser and basketball association head. He was elected CBA president in February.

A total of up to 20 billion yuan could be paid at the provincial level as bonuses
Beijing will offer rewards to nine provinces that exceeded their capacity cut targets in 2016, financed by a portion of the 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) subsidy allotted to help address overcapacity, Xu Hongcai, assistant finance minister, said on Friday.
Rewards for good performance will facilitate overall progress in cutting overcapacity this year, but less-developed areas that face greater difficulties with economic restructuring also need more financial help, experts said.
Local governments and enterprises in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will receive money for going beyond capacity cut targets in the steel sector. Chongqing, and Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces will receive grants for cuts in the coal sector, Xu said.
"The final amount given to each province will be revealed after the central government verifies the performance of each province last year," Xu said. "We will make sure that the allocation of money is transparent."
The total amount of the rewards would amount to a maximum of 20 percent of 100 billion yuan in special funds established in 2016, Xu said. The remaining 80 percent would be allotted to all regions to help with capacity cuts, he said.
Xu did not provide details on when the amounts will be announced or how the money will be spent.
"The central government's financial support is vital in helping the province achieve the capacity cut target because relocating workers and business restructuring are very costly," said Ji Jinghang, curator of Hangzhou Low-Carbon Museum in Zhejiang province.
Zhejiang's developed and balanced economy allows its laid-off workers to find jobs more easily than those in less-developed places such as in the economically lagging northeastern region.
Zhejiang ranked 14th nationwide in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017, with an 8 percent year-on-year growth rate, while Jilin province, saddled with heavy capacity cut targets, registered 2.4 percent growth during the same quarter.
Zhejiang plans to cut 2 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2020, while the target set for the steel sector this year alone in Jilin is 800,000 tons, according to provincial government documents.
Cheng Gong, a senior China National Coal Association analyst, said economically lagging regions need more financial support from the central government than last year because local governments face higher pressure to achieve targets.

Students from Guangxi University of Science and Technology play with pupils in Tantou township, Liuzhou city, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in July. English, dancing, painting and calligraphy classes were held for the pupils during summer vacation. Tan Kaixing / for China Daily
The pupils are watched by tens of thousands of people nationwide. It reminds us of the movie The Truman Show, where the main character lives in an artificial mini-world where he is watched by a worldwide audience around the clock.
The difference is, at the end of the movie Truman escapes from the artificial world in which he has been living, but the pupils are still being watched by audiences nationwide even though the media has exposed the voyeurism.
Legally speaking, school authorities that install cameras in classrooms and dormitories and provide video to live broadcast websites violate pupils' rights, because they invade the children's privacy without their consent.
According to reports, some of the schools argued they obtained consent from the pupils' parents when installing the cameras. The problem is, even though the pupils are minors they have the right to their own privacy, and so the consent of their parents is not valid. More important, the schools did not tell the parents that videos would be provided to live broadcast websites to be streamed nationwide.
Some "experts" have even claimed the pupils are attending a class and classrooms are public areas, so such broadcasts are not infringing on their privacy. Such opinions are nonsense because they totally ignore the pupils' legal right to privacy and the fact that classrooms are not public spaces to which everyone has the right of access.
China has been constantly improving the rule of law and made many achievements in the past few years. But it seems, teachers and schools need reminding they must respect the legal rights of their pupils. If the pupils realize their privacy and legal rights are being violated in such a way, how can they trust the rule of law?

China National Chemical Corp, also known as ChemChina, said on Friday that shareholders of Syngenta AG, the Swiss agrochemical and seed producer, have accepted its $43 billion takeover bid, paving the way for completion of China's biggest international acquisition deal.

Based on preliminary numbers, 80.7 percent of shares were tendered in favor of the acquisition, higher than the minimum acceptance rate of 67 percent needed for the deal to go through, ChemChina said in a statement

The first payment settlement is scheduled for May 18.

The Chinese company plans to delist Syngenta's shares in Switzerland and the United States at an appropriate time.

"The completion of this deal will help ChemChina become one of the world's largest suppliers of pesticides and other crop-care chemicals," said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing.

However, Ding said Dow Chemical Co's merger with DuPont Co and Bayer AG's purchase of Monsanto Co, which occurred in the past two years, would continue to provide intense market competition with ChemChina, as the top six international suppliers including Syngenta and BASF SE, have all been vying for market share and financial resources to push research and development of new products.

Zhang Xiaoping, director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said China could use Syngenta's deep experience and resources in intellectual property, risk control and environmental management to bring its products to global markets.

"On the other hand, Syngenta will have better access than other global companies to sell its products in our domestic markets," said Xu Hongcai, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.

"China's pesticide industry is riddled with low profitability and only global scale can improve that."

The government pins high hopes on the reform to solve structural issues in the agricultural sector, where some agricultural products are oversupplied while others rely heavily on imports.

China has been encouraging its companies to use both domestic and global resources to ensure the country's grain and food security in its agricultural policy.

Niu Dun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said earlier this year that the deal would generate a positive outcome for China to upgrade its abilities in grain and food production, supply chain building and processing.

Syngenta has 28,000 employees in more than 90 countries and regions. Its sales revenue dropped 1 percent year-on-year to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017.

Beijing-headquartered ChemChina possesses production, research and development, and marketing systems in 150 countries and regions. Materials sciences, life sciences, high-end manufacturing and basic chemicals are its main businesses.

It also acquired nine companies in France, the United Kingdom, Israel, Italy and Germany.

Two Chinese geological parks were approved on Friday to enter the Global Geoparks Network established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The two parks, Arxan National Geopark and Koktokay National Geopark, are located respectively in northwest China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Arxan National Geopark in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region is characterized by its landscape of volcanoes and hot springs and a large variety of lava formations, such as rocks and volcanic crater lakes.
Koktokay National Geopark is located in the Altay Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It has a large area of mining pits, with deposits of over 80 kinds of minerals. The park is also well-known for the granite landscapes and an earthquake fault zone.
A total of eight geoparks were approved to enter the network on Friday, with the others scattered in Spain, France, Iran, Mexico and South Korea. The new approval raises the total number in the list to 127.

James passes Abdul-Jabbar mark as Cavs crush Raptors
CLEVELAND - Unstoppable. Untouchable. Undefeated.
Back on the playoff stage, where he's starred so many times before, LeBron James is making things look easy.
James scored 39 points, passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time career playoff scoring list and pushed the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 125-103 blowout over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday night.
Just like a year ago in the conference final, the Cavs are up 2-0 on the Raptors, who had better figure some things out or this series will be over quickly.
Toronto was blown out for the fifth straight time in Cleveland in the playoffs, losing each by an average of 24.2 points.
Game 3 is on Friday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre.
James, who has won a road game in 27 consecutive series, appears determined to toss Toronto aside. He finished 10 of 14 from the field, dropped four 3-pointers and 15 free throws.
"He did miss six free throws," cracked Toronto's Kyle Lowry. "He's playing unbelievable. He's playing like LeBron James."
In Cleveland's past nine playoff wins, James is averaging 34.9 points, 10 rebounds and 8.1 assists.
Kyrie Irving had 22 points and 11 assists and Channing Frye scored 18 points for the reigning champions, who are 6-0 so far defending their title. Cleveland is 9-0 since losing Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals.
The Raptors didn't start Jonas Valanciunas, but he led them with 23 points. Toronto only got five points from All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who didn't make his first field goal until the first minute of the fourth quarter.
Of bigger concern might be the status of Lowry, who sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. He scored 20 points but spent the fourth quarter in the locker room icing his ankle.
"It's pretty sore," Lowry said after limping to the postgame podium. "I'm going to get treatment and get ready for Game 3."
James came in needing 25 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, and he overtook the Hall of Fame center with a 3-pointer in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped the Cavs open a 26-point lead.
James (5,777 points) now only trails Michael Jordan (5,987), the player to whom he has been compared since he was a teenager, for the most points in postseason history.
James is also trying to match Jordan's six titles. He's halfway there, and the way the Cavs are playing, he could have No 4 before long.
Raptors coach Dwane Casey promised the Raptors "would be a different team tonight coming out".
He started a smaller lineup, benching the 7-foot Valanciunas and forward DeMarre Carroll in favor of guard Norman Powell and forward Patrick Patterson.
Casey also moved Serge Ibaka from power forward to center.
The moves were intended to give Toronto more ball handlers and open the floor on offense.
They didn't work, simply because the Raptors couldn't contain James.
Casey, though, is confident his team can go home and even the series.
"I believe in our players," he said. "I believe in our guys. I know there is another level we can get to. I've seen it before."
It won't matter if James raises his, too.
Milestone
James also became the fourth player with 300 career 3-pointers in the postseason, joining Ray Allen (385), Reg-gie Miller (320) and Manu Ginobili (312).
On his 40th birthday, coach Tyronn Lue said the best gift would be a win. But the former NBA journeyman, who won two titles and played for seven teams, reflected on the milestone.
"A little kid from Mexico (Missouri) with just dreams and hopes," he said.
"You never thought it would come true, but I worked hard and I'm here and I'm just blessed."

Swiss President Doris Leuthard speaks during an interview with Xinhua in Bern, Switzerland, on Jan 12, 2017. She is expected to attend the Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15. [Photo/Xinhua]
GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.

BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.

Higuain brace has Italians eyeing Cardiff
MONACO - Gonzalo Higuain urged his Juventus teammates to keep their feet on the ground after he scored both goals in a brilliant 2-0 win in Monaco on Wednesday that left the Italian squad on the brink of the Champions League final.
Argentine striker Higuain was set up by Dani Alves to open the scoring in the 29th minute, then converted an Alves cross just before the hour as Juve claimed a crucial victory in the semifinal first leg at Stade Louis II.
The Italian champion has the final in Cardiff on June 3 in its sights, with a showdown against holder Real Madrid, Higuain's former side, looking probable.
"The dream we have been pursuing since August has been to get to Cardiff and we are just one step away," said Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season following his $98 million transfer from Napoli.
"We have not won anything yet, so we mustn't get carried away," added Higuain, who ended a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages.
"I stayed calm. I knew everyone had faith in me and that hard work is always rewarded in the end."
Juventus shone in all areas against a Monaco side that has lit up Europe this season with a thrilling brand of attacking soccer.
Buffon still strong
But the host found Juve's defense rock solid, with Gianluigi Buffon majestic as ever in goal.
The 39-year-old, making his 149th European appearance, denied Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao in the first half and produced a stunning fingertip stop on Valere Germain late in the second.
Juventus, which welcomes Monaco to Turin for the second leg next Tuesday, has now gone over 10 hours without conceding in the Champions League and Buffon has blanked the opposition in five matches in the knockout rounds.
"In every game I want to show that I deserve to play at this level despite my age," said Buffon, twice a losing finalist in the Champions League.
"I work hard every day for this. The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it.
"We had the right approach. They are a fearsome team and the only way to beat them was playing the way we did."
Buffon also praised coach Massimiliano Allegri for his decision to bring Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defense, thwarting Monaco's attack and allowing Alves to wreak havoc down the right.
"Gigi showed that he is still a great goalkeeper. He always does it in big games, and Higuain scored two lovely goals," said Allegri.
"But to get results, everyone needs to work hard. You need to make sacrifices and track back and he did that too."
'More clinical'
Juventus could wrap up a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this weekend, when it faces city rival Torino, while Lazio awaits in the Italian Cup final.
To put its performance in the principality into context, Monaco had won its previous 13 home games and scored in 41 consecutive matches at Stade Louis II since November 2015.
"They were more clinical than us - with two or three chances they scored and we couldn't put any of ours away. Buffon made some incredible saves," said Monaco head coach Leonardo Jardim, who sorely missed injured marauding leftback Benjamin Mendy.
Now Monaco must attempt to become just the third team ever to overturn a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League.
"It is difficult, but we need to keep believing. The best thing is to believe it is possible, even if we only have a five percent chance," Jardim added.
In the meantime, Monaco will switch its focus back to its attempt to win the French title.
It plays Nancy on Saturday and needs two wins from its last four league games to become champion.

As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.

Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."

China's foreign trade is expected to sustain an upward trend in the near future, as more export-oriented companies focus on developing new levels of competitiveness, according to the spokesman of the nation's biggest trade event.
"Chinese exporters are no longer manufacturers focusing on intensive production and lower pricing to compete in the global market," said Xu Bing, spokesman of the Canton Fair.
The Canton Fair－held twice a year and known as the China Import and Export Fair－concluded on Friday in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou with reported total transactions at the spring fair increasing by 6.9 percent year-on-year to 206.357 billion yuan ($30 billion).
"Development of new competitiveness－including technology, brands, quality and services－is reasons behind the increased transactions for Chinese exporters," said Xu, also deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
There were 196,490 overseas buyers from 213 countries and regions visiting the fair, a rise of 5.87 percent year-on-year.
"We can see that more companies participating in the Canton Fair displayed products with higher quality and design, which offer high added values and are more competitive in the global market," Xu added.
The spokesman said more companies were attaching importance to innovation and building overseas branding and sales centers.
Transactions at the brand exhibition areas during the fair increased by 16.9 percent year-on-year to $10.9 billion, accounting for 36.3 percent of the total.
Su Cheng, general manager of Taizhou Chenghao Machine Mould Co Ltd, said Chinese homegrown moulds, which are of high quality with competitive prices, had also been sold to developed markets.
"The demand for Chinese moulds has been increasing recently in developed markets, which are traditionally powerhouses for high-quality industrial moulds," said Su.
According to Su, the company's moulds have been sold in major markets like the United States, Japan and Russia.
"The demand from developed markets began steadily increasing from the second half of last year. We are making efforts to developing high-quality moulds to satisfy the demand," said Su.
The Zhejiang-based company, which is mainly engaged in production and sale of moulds for industrial air conditioners, also develops garden pots which can automatically water flowers.

PARIS - Polling stations opened on France's European mainland on Sunday for a decisive round of the presidential election between centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-rightist Marine Le Pen.
More than 66,000 polling stations in the French European mainland opened at 08:00 local time (0600 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 20:00 (1800 GMT) in big cities, while the rest will close at 19:00 (1700 GMT).
Nearly 47 million voters are expected to cast their ballots.
French voters in overseas territories casted their votes on Saturday, but the results will be only known after all votes are casted on the mainland.
Official campaigning period ended Friday night, signalling the start of a blackout on any campaigning activities, according to French electoral law.
The law bans the publication of any early poll or counting results of the vote before all polling stations are closed.
Preliminary projections of the voting results are expected to be revealed by various sources after 20:00.
Macron and Le Pen topped the first round vote of the election on April 23, with 24.01 percent and 21.30 percent of votes, respectively.
Several major French opinion polls conducted after the first round have been consistent, which estimate that former economy minister Macron is likely to win the runoff after an intense campaign against Le Pen.

Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also known as the Forbidden City, will expand the sale of online tickets on a trial basis in July.
The trial run will last from July to October to test the feasibility of online sales of tickets for everyday, but tourists can still buy tickets at the entrances, according to the museum.
After the trial period, the Palace Museum will decide whether to phase out the sale of paper tickets and sell all tickets via the internet.
The all online sale may begin during the last 10 days of October.
By the May Day holiday in 2018, the museum may offer tickets for different periods throughout a day, in a bid to avoid too many tourists at a time.
Currently, tourists can only book tickets online in advance, but they have to buy paper tickets at the entrances if they want to visit immediately.
The Palace Museum began selling tickets online in September 2011. Currently about 50 percent of its tickets are sold online, with up to 70 percent booked online during holidays.
The Palace Museum started to set a daily visitor cap of 80,000 on June 13, 2015. The cap was triggered 32 times in 2015, 48 in 2016, and 10 in 2017.
Three steps to phase out sale of paper tickets
Phase 1: Preparation
Date: May - June
Starting from May, the museum will allow online selling of tickets for everyday, after an upgrade of its online ticket selling system.
Phase 2: Trial run
Date: July - October
The trial will test the feasibility of online sales of tickets, but tourists can also buy tickets at the entrances. Tourists can also buy tickets by scanning a QR code at the entrances.
Phase 3: Implementation
Date: From last 10 days of October
A full online sale will be carried out at a proper date, when no paper tickets will be offered at the entrances anymore.

C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily]
The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry.
With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft.
Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls.
Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft.
All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials.
These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919.
Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei."
Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane.
"The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said.
"Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said.
By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast.
Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035.
After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years.
So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates a point during her victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci at last week's WTA Stuttgart Grand Prix. Reuters
LONDON - Maria Sharapova might have to wait until June 20 to see if she will be welcomed back to Wimbledon this year.
Sharapova, the 2004 champion at the All England Club, returned to the WTA Tour last week after serving a 15-month ban for doping and reached the semifinals in Stuttgart, leaving her ranked No 262.
The Russian's return has sparked controversy on the tour, with some rivals saying she has been given preferential treatment.
The former world No 1 is set to play two more events, in Madrid and Rome, before the deadline for direct entry to Wimbledon qualifying.
Deep runs at those events could earn her enough points to make the main draw, while she will also find out on May 16 if she gets a wild card for the French Open.
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said on Wednesday there will be a meeting of the tournament's sub-committee on June 20, when it will be clear which players have been accepted into the main draw.
Wimbledon begins on July 3, its latest start since 1895.
Andy Murray, the world's No 1 men's player, said he expects Sharapova to be granted a wild card if she needs one.
"But I'm sure they are hoping they don't have to make the decision," Murray said at the launch of the Queen's Club tournament, a warm-up event for Wimbledon.
"There's a good chance that she can get in by right, which I'm sure is what she's hoping for and that's what Wimbledon would be hoping for."
Lewis said qualifying at nearby Roehampton would be a ticketed event for the first time, and that action on one of the courts will be broadcast live.
He said this was not linked to the possible appearance of Sharapova, but because of the upsurge in interest in qualifying matches.
Lewis also announced there will be a 12.5 percent increase in total Wimbledon prize money, to $40.8 million.
Winners of the singles titles will each pocket $2.85 million, a 10 percent increase from 2016.
First-round losers will receive $45,000, a 16.7 percent increase from 2016, as Wimbledon officials say they are placing more emphasis on helping lower-ranked players.
In another development, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said two-time Wimbledon finalist Ilie Nastase will not be invited to the Royal Box on Centre Court.
The 70-year-old Romanian has been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation following his comments about the skin color of the baby Serena Williams is expecting, and his foul-mouthed outbursts during a recent Fed Cup match between Romania and Britain.
"What he did, we have to say, his actions were not very good and we condemn them," Brook said.
Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Williams' unborn baby when he said: "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?"
The two-time Grand Slam winner also asked British captain Anne Keothavong for her hotel room number and verbally abused umpire Jaume Campistol and referee Andreas Egli before swearing at Keothavong and British player Johanna Konta as he was banished from the court.
Nastase was escorted out by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie.
A national icon in Romania, Nastase defied the ban by briefly returning the following day. He pointedly refused to apologize in the immediate aftermath of the controversy, saying he had no regrets.
Nastase, who twice finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in the 1970s, is awaiting sanction by the International Tennis Federation after being hit with a provisional suspension.

CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."

The lottery will guarantee "transparent and fair distribution" of units, and is part of the city's measures to curb speculation in the housing market.
Shanghai's housing regulator also said real estate developers, agents and sales companies are forbidden from getting involved in speculative home sales.
The authorities concerned will blacklist firms and individuals that violate the rules.
Property firms and agents need to carry out only genuine, verifiable deals and prevent transactions involving fictitious names aimed at circumventing purchase limits, said the circular, which was issued late on Thursday.
Analysts said the lottery system will benefit buyers of smaller, lower-priced properties that are in limited supply and hence in high demand.
The lottery system also requires that transactions be notarized to ensure fair and transparent distribution of market-oriented housing projects.
The lottery system has been widely applied already in the distribution of subsidized government housing for lower-income families and low-rent houses.
"When supply (of new homes) doesn't meet demand, a notarized lottery system will work better than any other system. Unnotarized lottery systems used to lead to underhand dealings in the past, and scalpers would enter the market to resell home purchase qualifications. Now, the new system will maximize protection for homebuyers," said Yan Yuejin, a senior researcher with the E-house China R&D Institute.
Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with Centaline Property, said the lottery system supplements existing home purchase restrictions in Shanghai. It is likely to be adopted by other cities facing similar demand-supply mismatches.
Shanghai's new homes inventory by April-end stood at 6.28 million square meters, which would be absorbed by the market in nine months, if there are no more supplies, E-house data showed.
In Shanghai, stricter limits have been imposed on homebuyers' qualifications and down payment requirements to stabilize prices.

PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Saturday that the latest US-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint military drills were "unprecedentedly hideous and most adventurous ones" in several decades.
In a military commentary, the official Korean Central News Agency said the US and ROK have made it public that all their joint military drills aimed to "remove the leadership" of the DPRK and "bring down its system."
These exercises had "thrown away their deceptive veils as annual drills and defensive ones," it said.
"The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills revealed that the new Trump administration, too, is resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK by use of force, tougher sanctions and pressure," it said.
The US and ROK have just concluded two-month-long joint military drills involving 300,000 troops.
The US has also sent its aircraft carrier task group USS Carl Vinson and a nuclear submarine to waters off the Korean peninsula, besides carrying out nuclear bomb dropping drills in ROK and test launching two intercontinental ballistic missile within one week from California to the Western Pacific over the past two weeks.

The 4th Xinghao Youth Script and Creative Designing Competition and Award Ceremony was held at the Beiguo Theater of Beijing Normal University on May 4 as a part of the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival.
"A successful film may involve many factors such as a good director, popular performers or brilliant visual effects, but a failed one must have a close relationship with the quality of a certain script," Wang Hailin, renowned Chinese playwright, said at the competition.
"College students represent the most vigorous and passionate group in the entire society. When you devote yourselves to writing scripts, you may be faced with many temptations like money, power, glory or status, but you should not forget your original will, and stick to your dream," he added.
Since its call for scripts one month ago, a total of 540 creative scripts from various fields were sent by students from many top universities, including Beijing Film Academy, The Central Academy of Drama, Shanghai Theatre Academy, Communication University of China, Peking University, Fudan University.
Eighteen candidates’ scripts were selected for the final competition. There were three second prize winners, five third prize winners and 10 consolation prizes awarded.

Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]
With the United States having withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, trade officials from the remaining members gathered in Canada on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking ways to keep it alive. But can they really make any breakthrough?
The US accounted for about 24 percent of the world's total GDP last year according to the World Bank. Thus, a TPP without the US is simply not feasible. With the US having a central role, the economies of the member countries were complementary to it. After the US' withdrawal from the deal, the total share of the remaining TPP members has decreased to 13 percent of the world's total GDP and the competition among them has increased while the complementary nature of their economies has decreased.
For instance, Japan and Australia both want to export their agriculture products. Australia and Canada both want to increase their exports of minerals. Thus, the real economic value of any TPP without the US is limited. Considering the business community is more sensitive to the economic benefits than its political purposes, the strategic advantages calculated by politicians may not be enough to win the support of the business communities in the various countries.
If a deal was ratified without the US, it would send a very strong signal that the US has lost direct control of it. Then US President Donald Trump's decision to quit would be harshly criticized as a policy mistake, the US' credibility would be doubted by its allies, and, should the US want to join someday, it would have lost the initial advantages it had.
For the Barack Obama administration, the TPP had dual values. One was its economic value, the other its strategic value.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated in January 2016 that the TPP would increase annual real incomes in the US by $131 billion, 0.5 percent of its GDP, by 2030, and its annual exports by $357 billion, 9.1 percent of its GDP, by the same year.
But on Jan 23, Trump, the newly installed US president, signed an executive order to quit the TPP.
He had a number of justifications for this.
First, although joining the TPP would have been lucrative for the US as a whole, many of his supporters, especially blue-collar workers disliked the TPP and claimed it would hurt them. Fulfilling his campaign promise to these voters was necessary to legitimize Trump's presidency.
Second, Trump's withdrawal from the TPP doesn't mean it has died. The agreement is still there and can be resurrected if desired.
Third, Trump was not satisfied with some of the clauses in the TPP. He wants to use withdrawal from the deal as a way to shift from the multilateral mechanism to bilateral mechanisms, and then use the efficiency of bilateral negotiations to "fix" the clauses in the TPP he is not happy with, and push the US' allies to take more responsibility.
Fourth, even though the TPP would still have a strategic function, without the US as a member its hedging function has been weakened dramatically, since most of the remaining members have strong economic and trade relations with China.
Trump has thus concluded that is it not a good deal for the US to sacrifice its market opportunities for such a limited strategic purpose. For Trump, an ungratified and stagnating TPP that can be resurrected when needed is in the best interests of the US.

Long seen as an anti-ageing treatment for women, more and more men are giving Botox – err, Brotox – a shot. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Enter Botox, a lethal neurotoxin (technically "botulinum toxin type A") that relaxes muscles via injection and was discovered to help reduce wrinkles by a California plastic surgeon in 1989. After a long period of formal trials, it was approved for use in the US in 2002 – and has since become a household name as the world's most common cosmetic procedure.
Long used by women, in the early Botox days, there were few male clients; most did it for occupational reasons, such as actors and anchormen. Through wider acceptance in society, it has become more common for men in recent years. Some clinics in Hong Kong even claim that male clients compose 50% of their business today. The rise in popularity explains how the humorous nickname "Brotox" has entered the vernacular.
Where do guys get their Brotox injected? They say the eyes are the key to the soul – and so the most popular areas address crow's feet and the vertical lines between the eyebrows. These lines can make a man look angry and unapproachable, which is why nine-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz, an open endorser of Botox, wanted to try it in the first place. In an interview with plastic surgery website Make Me Heal, Spitz explained, "I wasn't trying to look younger or different; I just wanted my face to portray how good I was feeling inside – instead of telling the world that I was perplexed or angry all the time."
Concerned about "surprise lines" on your forehead? Those annoying, intractable lines can also make you look older than you actually are, so a considerable amount of Botox treatments are focused on this area. However, it's hard to completely remove them because this is an easy-to-crease area.
Botox has been nicknamed the "lunchtime facelift" because it can be done in less than 15 minutes. Expect to see effects after two weeks of injection, with the best results after about a month. In Hong Kong, the standard practice is to have a consultation session with your doctor before deciding what areas to address and how many shots are needed. Fees are charged per area or per unit, depending on the clinic; locally, some start at HK$3,000 per treatment package of 10 units. You don't need to drastically change your routine or eating habits. Just avoid alcohol on the first day of injection and don't apply pressure to the area. So, what are your plans for lunch?

CAI MENG/CHINA DAILY
Launched by President Xi Jinping in September 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is designed to improve global connectivity and physical infrastructure to better link China with the rest of Asia, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The initiative envisages the creation of multiple economic corridors under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.




In the past four years, the Belt and Road Initiative has gradually gained traction with new projects and financing coming on stream, such as the flagship 418-kilometer rail link with Laos and the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. While it's hard to quantify the total number of projects and amount of financing, the China Development Bank said it alone had reserved $890 billion for more than 900 projects in 2015, highlighting the magnitude of the undertaking.
Indeed, while new multilateral institutions such as the AIIB have started to play an active role in project financing, most of the funding for the initiative's projects is actually bilateral. In addition to that from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, we estimate that the "big-four" State-owned banks extended $90 billion loans to the economies along the initiative's two routes in 2016. Thus, bilateral financing from China's commercial and policy banks dwarfs multilateral financing and we expect that to remain the case in the future.
Nevertheless, even the combined annual bilateral and multilateral financing flows, including those from international multilateral institutions (such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) are modest compared to infrastructure spending and needs in the vast region covered by the initiative (the Asian Development Bank estimates the annual infrastructure investment needs at $1.7 trillion until 2030).
That said, the initiative-generated infrastructure will benefit some of the least developed parts of the world, and improved infrastructure should facilitate trade and investment, create new market demand and contribute to global development. While we estimate the region covered by the initiative will contribute 80 percent of global GDP growth by 2050, up from 68 percent in 2016, our fairly constructive projection of growth in the region is subject to downside risks, including those from global trade protectionism and, domestically, from supply side constraints, which, however, can be reduced by infrastructure development, and regional trade and investment collaboration.
Of course, China needs to make sure its engagement with other countries does not become unbalanced. Especially, it needs to ensure its manufacturing exports to the economies along the two routes do not crowd out domestic production and result in trade deficits that could lead to economic and/or political tensions. In fact, while the share of China's exports to the region covered by the initiative has grown steadily, from 23 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2016, the share of China's imports from the economies along the two routes has fallen in recent years (measured in US dollars)－partly because of the drop in commodity prices, though.
We expect Chinese construction companies to largely benefit from the initiative through new sources of demand abroad, but we don't expect it to have a major impact on mopping up excess capacity in China's heavy industry, because the annual demand for heavy industrial products in the initiative-generated projects will be small compared to the scale of overcapacity in China's heavy industries.
In conclusion, China has devoted significant amounts of political capital, energy and financial resources to the initiative, and it has made some notable progress over the past four years. And although the initiative's short-term macro impact is likely to be modest, if well managed, we expect it to support long-term growth and development in the economies involved. The initiative can also increase China's international influence by providing a platform for it to enhance its role in global financial governance, and eventually help the internationalization of the yuan by encouraging its use in both trade and financial transactions, albeit under the condition that China liberalizes its capital account.

BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.

A potential homebuyer checks out a property project in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Dec 17, 2016. [Asianewsphoto by Long Wei]
BEIJING HAS INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES to cool its real estate market. At least eight banks have raised their mortgage interest rates, and five no longer accept personal applications for loans if their pledges are commercial real estate. The Mirror, a Beijing-based newspaper, comments:




These cooling measures come at the right time. As property prices in the capital have continuously risen, hot money rushed into the realty market. If that trend continues, the ever-growing bubble in the housing market would pose a challenge to the national economy.
The falling number of secondhand house deals best shows that the measures are quite effective. According to realty agencies, the number of secondhand house deals registered via online platforms in April was 16,902, 35 percent lower than the figure in March and 36 percent lower year-on-year.
But while applauding the firm actions taken by the authorities to curb speculation, we also hope they can take into consideration the needs of those who sell smaller apartments to buy a bigger one to meet their needs.
According to the current regulations, these people need to pay higher down payments as well as higher interest rates for their housing loans, even the tax and administrative fees for their deals are higher.
Some people want to buy a bigger apartment because they have growing families. Such buyers are not speculators. It is time to distinguish them from speculators and consider giving them tax incentives and other favorable policies.
On Wednesday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, announced its 2017 legislative work plan, according to which a property tax will be considered. By taxing those who own two or more houses, a property tax would be an effective way to curb speculation.
That move is also long-term because it will be part of the law. We look forward to the introduction of a property tax as it will help root out speculation from the realty market.

Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."

CHANGCHUN - In a few months, Huiyuanlongyun Chateau, a huge leisure park, with wine as the theme in northeast China, will throw open its cellar doors to the public.
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan ($58 million), the 13-hectare complex in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, will be an area for grape plantation, wine-making, eating, drinking, sightseeing and having fun.
"People tend to think that such chateaus only exist in France, but as demand grows, domestic chateaus are also growing," said Liu Shuhang, in charge of the wine industry in Tonghua.
In Tonghua, the best wine-making area in northeast China, similar complexes have sprung up in the last few years. There are now about 20 of them in the city.
Tonghua is located between 40 degrees to 43 degrees north, a similar latitude to some of the best wine-making regions in Italy and Spain, making it one of the best places for viticulture in China. The city has around 3,500 hectares of vineyards, producing almost 60,000 tonnes of grapes each year. There are now close to 70 wineries there, with over 100 production lines, but the wine industry in China has huge room for growth. The country currently has close to 500,000 hectares of vineyards, with only about 100,000 devoted to wine-making.
China was the world's fifth biggest consumer of wine in 2015, but it is also the most populous country in the world. In the United States, for example, annual wine consumption is around 11 liters per capita. That's about ten times more than the average Chinese, according to the Wine Institute, based in California.
In March, the wine and spirit exhibition VINEXPO, released some projections which put China as the world's second biggest wine market by 2020, when sales in the country are expected to reach $21 billion.
In places like Tonghua, visitors can not only drink wine, but also have fun picking grapes and joining in parts of the production process.
"Chateaus are not just a place to taste wine and enjoy the scenery," said Liu. "They are learning centers where visitors come to a better understanding of wine culture."
Liang Zhengkui, a chateau owner in Tonghua, sees building such complexes as a way to expand the wine industry.
"We allow the tourists to feel the wine culture by having a great experience in the chateaus," he said.
Such idea has become common among those engaged in the wine industry in northeast China.
Wang Jun, a Tonghua vintner, believes that the wine industry will not be just about wine itself, but about spin-offs.
"We incorporate wine and tourism by inviting the consumers to the chateaus," Wang said. "For them, drinking wine becomes a wonderful cultural experience."
"Compared to Bordeaux, the number of Chinese 'chateaus' is quite limited at the moment, but I am sure that they have a bright future," said Liu. "We have a unique Chinese culture, and I believe it will attract more and more domestic and foreign oenophiles."

Two Chinese geological parks were approved on Friday to enter the Global Geoparks Network established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The two parks, Arxan National Geopark and Koktokay National Geopark, are located respectively in northwest China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
Arxan National Geopark in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region is characterized by its landscape of volcanoes and hot springs and a large variety of lava formations, such as rocks and volcanic crater lakes.
Koktokay National Geopark is located in the Altay Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It has a large area of mining pits, with deposits of over 80 kinds of minerals. The park is also well-known for the granite landscapes and an earthquake fault zone.
A total of eight geoparks were approved to enter the network on Friday, with the others scattered in Spain, France, Iran, Mexico and South Korea. The new approval raises the total number in the list to 127.

LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers lays up a shot against the Toronto Raptors' Kyle Lowry in Game 2 of their NBA Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday in Cleveland. James scored 39 points to help the Cavs to a 125-103 victory and a 2-0 series lead. Tony Dejak / Ap
James passes Abdul-Jabbar mark as Cavs crush Raptors 
CLEVELAND - Unstoppable. Untouchable. Undefeated. 
Back on the playoff stage, where he's starred so many times before, LeBron James is making things look easy. 
James scored 39 points, passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time career playoff scoring list and pushed the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 125-103 blowout over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal on Wednesday night. 
Just like a year ago in the conference final, the Cavs are up 2-0 on the Raptors, who had better figure some things out or this series will be over quickly. 
Toronto was blown out for the fifth straight time in Cleveland in the playoffs, losing each by an average of 24.2 points. 
Game 3 is on Friday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre. 
James, who has won a road game in 27 consecutive series, appears determined to toss Toronto aside. He finished 10 of 14 from the field, dropped four 3-pointers and 15 free throws. 
"He did miss six free throws," cracked Toronto's Kyle Lowry. "He's playing unbelievable. He's playing like LeBron James." 
In Cleveland's past nine playoff wins, James is averaging 34.9 points, 10 rebounds and 8.1 assists. 
Kyrie Irving had 22 points and 11 assists and Channing Frye scored 18 points for the reigning champions, who are 6-0 so far defending their title. Cleveland is 9-0 since losing Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals. 
The Raptors didn't start Jonas Valanciunas, but he led them with 23 points. Toronto only got five points from All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who didn't make his first field goal until the first minute of the fourth quarter. 
Of bigger concern might be the status of Lowry, who sprained his left ankle in the third quarter. He scored 20 points but spent the fourth quarter in the locker room icing his ankle. 
"It's pretty sore," Lowry said after limping to the postgame podium. "I'm going to get treatment and get ready for Game 3." 
James came in needing 25 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, and he overtook the Hall of Fame center with a 3-pointer in the third quarter, when he scored 17 points and helped the Cavs open a 26-point lead. 
James (5,777 points) now only trails Michael Jordan (5,987), the player to whom he has been compared since he was a teenager, for the most points in postseason history. 
James is also trying to match Jordan's six titles. He's halfway there, and the way the Cavs are playing, he could have No 4 before long. 
Raptors coach Dwane Casey promised the Raptors "would be a different team tonight coming out". 
He started a smaller lineup, benching the 7-foot Valanciunas and forward DeMarre Carroll in favor of guard Norman Powell and forward Patrick Patterson. 
Casey also moved Serge Ibaka from power forward to center. 
The moves were intended to give Toronto more ball handlers and open the floor on offense. 
They didn't work, simply because the Raptors couldn't contain James. 
Casey, though, is confident his team can go home and even the series. 
"I believe in our players," he said. "I believe in our guys. I know there is another level we can get to. I've seen it before." 
It won't matter if James raises his, too. 
Milestone 
James also became the fourth player with 300 career 3-pointers in the postseason, joining Ray Allen (385), Reg-gie Miller (320) and Manu Ginobili (312). 
On his 40th birthday, coach Tyronn Lue said the best gift would be a win. But the former NBA journeyman, who won two titles and played for seven teams, reflected on the milestone. 
"A little kid from Mexico (Missouri) with just dreams and hopes," he said. 
"You never thought it would come true, but I worked hard and I'm here and I'm just blessed."

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd said that the C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, is set to become the new star of its 600-plus aircraft fleet, stating that its "safety and state-of-the-art design will bring superb a flying experience to its passengers".
In a written reply to China Daily, the Shanghai-based airline, which is expected to be the first carrier to take delivery of the homegrown single-aisle passenger jet, said it was "extremely confident about the future of the C919".
China Eastern pre-ordered 20 C919s from the aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd in 2010, and according to the purchase agreement, negotiations for the ordering of the first five planes will be launched within a year of the C919's maiden flight.
China Eastern is one of the nation's top three airlines, serving more than 100 million passengers in flights to 177 nations and regions in 1,062 destinations every year.
ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, the subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, announced its intention to purchase 45 C919 aircraft in October 2011. ICBC Financial Leasing is looking to support COMAC with joint marketing, market surveys, signing more orders and all-around financial services in the future, said Xu Qing, deputy CEO of ICBC Leasing.
"C919 will serve the most attractive market. The aircraft will be used in the domestic market, the Asia-Pacific region and the African market in its early days. By continuously optimizing the aircraft's performance, the C919 will go global in the future," said Xu.
With regard to the two dominant commercial aircraft makers－Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE－she suggested the future C919 should pay more attention to service at the beginning to build up its brand first.
"It's important to pay attention to customer support and services, and enhance product quality and stability. Overseas marketing should be based on continuously optimized products and services, an efficient maintenance support, and efficiency of operations," said Xu.

BEIJING - China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia, on Wednesday.Alexander Zemlianichenko / Reuters
SOCHI, Russia - Russia and Turkey have agreed to lift nearly all remaining trade restrictions imposed in the aftermath of Ankara's downing of a Russian warplane in 2015, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. 
"You asked when we can speak about the lifting of the restrictions that emerged some time ago. We can speak of that today," Putin said at a news conference alongside his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
"We agreed on a comprehensive solution to all these problems linked to the restrictions." 
Relations between Moscow and Ankara hit rock bottom after Turkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane in Syria, which Putin at the time labeled a "stab in the back". 
In the wake of the incident, Moscow slapped a range of sanctions on Ankara, including an embargo on some Turkish food products, as well as a ban on charter flights and sales of package tours to the country and the reintroduction of visas for Turkish visitors. 
But Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's embargo on the import of tomatoes from Turkey and its visa restrictions on Turkish nationals will remain in place for the time being. 
He did not provide a timeline for the lifting of these two restrictions. 
"Now we can say with certainty that the recovery period in Russo-Turkish relations is over," Putin said. "We are returning to a normal cooperation partnership." 
Putin last year ordered that the government normalize trade ties with Turkey as he lifted the ban on the sale of packages tours in Turkey.

BEIJING - Since childhood, Palestinian Dima Albughdadi dreamed of going to China to learn the Chinese language.
"When I was a little girl, I used to stare in wonder at the Chinese ornaments displayed in shop windows and imagine going to China myself one day."
She remembers copying down Chinese characters crookedly in her notebook and seeing them on T-shirts. "Although I had no idea what they meant, joy would fill my heart whenever I saw them," she said.
However, in Palestine, it was never easy for girls like Albughdadi to go to university. She applied to study Chinese at the University of Jordan after high school, but as a Palestinian her options were limited and she couldn't enroll in her dream major unless she paid double the amount in the tuition fees.
Out of practical considerations, she eventually studied engineering. "My mind grew numb with dull formulas and mechanical thinking, and I derived no pleasure from it," Albughdadi said, recalling her two years of engineering study.
As her request to change major was repeatedly denied by her family, she realized that she had only herself to rely on in the pursuit for learning Chinese. So she began seeking whatever way possible: searching free online materials, watching video courses, and looking for Chinese-major students as language partners.
During her final year in college, Albughdadi was granted a scholarship by Dalian University of Technology for a one-year study in northeast China's port city of Dalian.
She said China gave her a sense of "deja vue" upon arrival, but the country is "far more beautiful that I thought, and the people here much kinder ... I've brought myself closer to my dream. My dreams of learning Chinese have come true over and over again."
Learning Chinese has become increasingly popular overseas in recent years, especially after China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Like Albughdadi, more young people from around the world have become fascinated with the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.
The ever closer ties between China and countries along the Belt and Road have provided ample opportunities for young people to realize their Chinese dreams.

China's foreign trade is expected to sustain an upward trend in the near future, as more export-oriented companies focus on developing new levels of competitiveness, according to the spokesman of the nation's biggest trade event.
"Chinese exporters are no longer manufacturers focusing on intensive production and lower pricing to compete in the global market," said Xu Bing, spokesman of the Canton Fair.
The Canton Fair－held twice a year and known as the China Import and Export Fair－concluded on Friday in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou with reported total transactions at the spring fair increasing by 6.9 percent year-on-year to 206.357 billion yuan ($30 billion).
"Development of new competitiveness－including technology, brands, quality and services－is reasons behind the increased transactions for Chinese exporters," said Xu, also deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
There were 196,490 overseas buyers from 213 countries and regions visiting the fair, a rise of 5.87 percent year-on-year.
"We can see that more companies participating in the Canton Fair displayed products with higher quality and design, which offer high added values and are more competitive in the global market," Xu added.
The spokesman said more companies were attaching importance to innovation and building overseas branding and sales centers.
Transactions at the brand exhibition areas during the fair increased by 16.9 percent year-on-year to $10.9 billion, accounting for 36.3 percent of the total.
Su Cheng, general manager of Taizhou Chenghao Machine Mould Co Ltd, said Chinese homegrown moulds, which are of high quality with competitive prices, had also been sold to developed markets.
"The demand for Chinese moulds has been increasing recently in developed markets, which are traditionally powerhouses for high-quality industrial moulds," said Su.
According to Su, the company's moulds have been sold in major markets like the United States, Japan and Russia.
"The demand from developed markets began steadily increasing from the second half of last year. We are making efforts to developing high-quality moulds to satisfy the demand," said Su.
The Zhejiang-based company, which is mainly engaged in production and sale of moulds for industrial air conditioners, also develops garden pots which can automatically water flowers.

WITH THE PRICE OF GARLIC SPROUTS plummeting due to oversupply, some farmers in Henan province have reportedly discarded their harvest of garlic sprouts, a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes. Beijing Youth Daily commented on Thursday:
The local governments in Henan have acted quickly to the overstock by pledging to set up a garlic association to nip oversupply in the bud. But what happened in Henan indicates once again how easy it is for farmers to fall prey to price fluctuations.
That some have urged the market to play its part at the cost of "non-market minded" farmers is hardly helpful. Farmers do not necessarily have to pay the price for being unaware of how the market works and when they should increase or reduce their production. Local agricultural officials are obliged to intervene if need be and guide farmers through these dark waters, rather than sit on the sidelines.
The roller coaster price alterations of Chinese agricultural products can be devastating to farmers, yet they are not uncontrollable.
Home to a relatively mature and stable agricultural market, the United States can offer a lesson or two on balancing supply and demand.
The food produced by one US farmer can feed about 155 people, and one-fifth of the country's food products are exported to the rest of the world. In recent decades, the US has rarely suffered from an excessive supply of soybeans, oranges, or milk thanks to its efficient supply chain, at the core of which is its agricultural cooperatives.
Cooperatives enable farmers to own and control, on a democratic basis, the procurement of supplies and services, and the selling of their products.
This should be heeded by many local governments in China, which either step back letting the market take over or improvise countermeasures such as initiating emergency buying in the face of an oversupply. Neither approach is a cure to the problems facing Chinese farmers.
The nationwide promotion of cooperatives seems to have yet to reach Henan's local governments, which only began discussing the possibility of establishing a garlic association after farmers threw their hard-earned harvest away.
Establishing online exchange platforms could also better prepare farmers for unexpected market changes.

Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct 5, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]
With the United States having withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, trade officials from the remaining members gathered in Canada on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking ways to keep it alive. But can they really make any breakthrough?
The US accounted for about 24 percent of the world's total GDP last year according to the World Bank. Thus, a TPP without the US is simply not feasible. With the US having a central role, the economies of the member countries were complementary to it. After the US' withdrawal from the deal, the total share of the remaining TPP members has decreased to 13 percent of the world's total GDP and the competition among them has increased while the complementary nature of their economies has decreased.
For instance, Japan and Australia both want to export their agriculture products. Australia and Canada both want to increase their exports of minerals. Thus, the real economic value of any TPP without the US is limited. Considering the business community is more sensitive to the economic benefits than its political purposes, the strategic advantages calculated by politicians may not be enough to win the support of the business communities in the various countries.
If a deal was ratified without the US, it would send a very strong signal that the US has lost direct control of it. Then US President Donald Trump's decision to quit would be harshly criticized as a policy mistake, the US' credibility would be doubted by its allies, and, should the US want to join someday, it would have lost the initial advantages it had.
For the Barack Obama administration, the TPP had dual values. One was its economic value, the other its strategic value.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated in January 2016 that the TPP would increase annual real incomes in the US by $131 billion, 0.5 percent of its GDP, by 2030, and its annual exports by $357 billion, 9.1 percent of its GDP, by the same year.
But on Jan 23, Trump, the newly installed US president, signed an executive order to quit the TPP.
He had a number of justifications for this.
First, although joining the TPP would have been lucrative for the US as a whole, many of his supporters, especially blue-collar workers disliked the TPP and claimed it would hurt them. Fulfilling his campaign promise to these voters was necessary to legitimize Trump's presidency.
Second, Trump's withdrawal from the TPP doesn't mean it has died. The agreement is still there and can be resurrected if desired.
Third, Trump was not satisfied with some of the clauses in the TPP. He wants to use withdrawal from the deal as a way to shift from the multilateral mechanism to bilateral mechanisms, and then use the efficiency of bilateral negotiations to "fix" the clauses in the TPP he is not happy with, and push the US' allies to take more responsibility.
Fourth, even though the TPP would still have a strategic function, without the US as a member its hedging function has been weakened dramatically, since most of the remaining members have strong economic and trade relations with China.
Trump has thus concluded that is it not a good deal for the US to sacrifice its market opportunities for such a limited strategic purpose. For Trump, an ungratified and stagnating TPP that can be resurrected when needed is in the best interests of the US.

A total of up to 20 billion yuan could be paid at the provincial level as bonuses
Beijing will offer rewards to nine provinces that exceeded their capacity cut targets in 2016, financed by a portion of the 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) subsidy allotted to help address overcapacity, Xu Hongcai, assistant finance minister, said on Friday.
Rewards for good performance will facilitate overall progress in cutting overcapacity this year, but less-developed areas that face greater difficulties with economic restructuring also need more financial help, experts said.
Local governments and enterprises in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will receive money for going beyond capacity cut targets in the steel sector. Chongqing, and Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi provinces will receive grants for cuts in the coal sector, Xu said.
"The final amount given to each province will be revealed after the central government verifies the performance of each province last year," Xu said. "We will make sure that the allocation of money is transparent."
The total amount of the rewards would amount to a maximum of 20 percent of 100 billion yuan in special funds established in 2016, Xu said. The remaining 80 percent would be allotted to all regions to help with capacity cuts, he said.
Xu did not provide details on when the amounts will be announced or how the money will be spent.
"The central government's financial support is vital in helping the province achieve the capacity cut target because relocating workers and business restructuring are very costly," said Ji Jinghang, curator of Hangzhou Low-Carbon Museum in Zhejiang province.
Zhejiang's developed and balanced economy allows its laid-off workers to find jobs more easily than those in less-developed places such as in the economically lagging northeastern region.
Zhejiang ranked 14th nationwide in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017, with an 8 percent year-on-year growth rate, while Jilin province, saddled with heavy capacity cut targets, registered 2.4 percent growth during the same quarter.
Zhejiang plans to cut 2 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2020, while the target set for the steel sector this year alone in Jilin is 800,000 tons, according to provincial government documents.
Cheng Gong, a senior China National Coal Association analyst, said economically lagging regions need more financial support from the central government than last year because local governments face higher pressure to achieve targets.

Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily]
Editor's note: China's passenger jet C919 is due to make its debut flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. Gao Zhenghong, a professor at the School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, who led the team that designed the airfoil for the C919, explains the importance of the aircraft to China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang.
Many people have pinned hopes on the C919, because it is the first domestically-built large passenger plane and could be put into operation between 2020 and 2022. Can you name a few advanced technologies it uses?




I will give only one example. An essential quality index of modern passenger jets is the percentage of third-generation aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy, a common material in the aircraft-making industry, and advanced composite materials used in a plane. Al-Li alloy comprises 8.8 percent and advanced composite materials 12 percent of the total materials used in the C919. And on both scores, the C919 is an improvement on the ARJ21, another domestically designed and built commercial aircraft.
More importantly, advanced composites have been used to build some load-carrying structures of the plane, such as the empennage (rear part of the body) and the horizontal stabilizer. That shows the development of domestic aircraft-making technology.
Some Western media outlets claim China "assembled" rather than "manufactured" the C919, as it has used many foreign technologies. Would you like to comment on that?
It's true we have used some foreign technologies in building the C919. For example, the aircraft has double CFM LEAP-1C engines, which are made by CFM International, a US-France joint venture. But that does not change the fact that the C919 was domestically made. Domestic research teams worked out its design, structure, aerodynamic layout and so on. That's why China has "independent intellectual property rights" over the C919.
Is the making of the C919 a milestone in the history of China's manufacturing industry?
I think so. A quite high percentage of its parts were made in China, which in turn required high-level domestic industries. Since the procedure for even assembling all the parts to build an aircraft is very complex, successfully completing it is a milestone in itself.
So what industries will the C919 promote?
There are so many: Metallurgy, material science, electronics and integrated circuits. For example, the C919 needs more reliable airborne equipments, and researchers will work out how to make them. It needs lighter but firmer materials and better structural design, which will help propel the material science and structural design sectors.
And although the engines installed in the C919 are foreign made, we cannot rule out the possibility of it using domestically made engines in the future. That will come as a challenge which, if successfully met, will boost the fortunes of engine-making companies.
Certain media outlets have said that thanks to the C919, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China poses a challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the two giants of the aviation industry.
I cannot say that. In my opinion, the building and debut flight of the C919 is more of a startup for the domestic aviation industry, because we have for the first time built such a passenger jet. It should give us the confidence to move forward.
Just like the Chinese saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and the C919 is the first step. We now know how to proceed further and accelerate our pace. With more support from the State and society, the domestic aviation industry will develop smoothly.
So what will be development direction of the domestic aviation industry now?
That's a national strategy, not an individual choice. The building of large passenger jets should be a State-level project, rather than a mission that can be completed by one or two groups. But I'm confident that with more support, China's aviation industry will surely prosper.

Swiss President Doris Leuthard speaks during an interview with Xinhua in Bern, Switzerland, on Jan 12, 2017. She is expected to attend the Belt and Road forum for international cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15. [Photo/Xinhua]
GENEVA - "The Belt and Road Initiative will strengthen well-being and contribute to poverty reduction in concerned regions. It will improve 'connectivity' between Europe and Asia, and help develop trade and the exchange of people," Swiss President Doris Leuthard told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Leuthard is among the heads of state and government leaders who accepted China's invitation to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation slated for May 14 and 15 in Beijing.
The trip to China reflects Switzerland's support for the Belt and Road Initiative. It also highlights the very positive relations prevailing between Switzerland and China, she said.
Leuthard noted that Switzerland was among the first non-Asian countries to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), whose mandate involves, amongst other things, financing infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road.
The improvement of transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia is also important for Switzerland, she said.
According to Leuthard, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to strengthen Sino-Swiss relations. By using the know-how and innovation of Swiss businesses, Switzerland's private sector can play an important role in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
As an example, Switzerland boasts globally recognized expertise in the green energy sector, as well as in the construction of tunnels.
"Only a few months ago, we opened the world's longest and most modern railway tunnel in the Swiss mountains," Leuthard said.
Leuthard stressed however that the initiative must integrate meticulous risk management for it to succeed.
This entails respecting internationally recognized norms and standards, something Switzerland already encourages within the AIIB in terms of social and environmental benchmarks.
It's also important to guarantee transparency with regards to project-financing mechanisms and legal measures guiding bidding procedures and attributions.
Finally, concerted planning on an international scale is crucial to carry out the projects in question.

A visitor poses for a photo on the glass bridge, in August. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
Editor's note: During the just-concluded May Day holiday, "glass paths" became the new buzzword in the tourism sector. Two experts share their views with China Daily's Zhang Zhouxiang on the mushrooming of glass-bottomed walkways over gorges in scenic spots across China.
Are the 'glass paths' worth the trouble?




Glass-bottomed bridges were first built between two cliffs so that people could enjoy the scenery around while being aware of the scary depth of the ravine below. For example, in Baishi Mountain Geological National Park in Baoding, North China's Hebei province, a 95-meter-long, 2-meter-wide glass-bottomed walkway was built at an average altitude of 1,900 meters to allow visitors to experience the beautiful but stomach-churning scenery below.
The problem is that glass-bottomed walkways have mushroomed across China. Search glass-bottomed walkways on domestic tourism website tuniu.com, and you will find that 24 cities have built such "glass paths" as their tourist sites. And since a majority of the "glass paths" have been built across valleys bereft of natural beauty, one cannot but question the wisdom to build them.
The rush to build "glass paths" shows the officials in the domestic tourist sites lack creativity. Instead of using the inherent advantages of the tourist sites, they are busy copying ideas and examples from others. Such homogenization fails to meet tourists' diversified demands.
More importantly, the glass needed for the glass-bottomed walkways is expensive and the total cost of such a bridge can run into several million yuan, and some tourist sites may fail to earn enough revenue to cover the expenses, let alone make profits, which would be a waste of tourism resources. And any compromise with the quality of the glass or the overall glass-bottomed bridge could spell trouble.
Liu Simin, vice-president of tourism at Beijing-based Chinese Society for Future Studies
Such bridges need total safety system
No major accidents have been reported from glass-bottomed walkways. And many tourism sites claim double-or multi-layered armored glass, which is three to four times stronger than ordinary glass, have been used to build such walkways.
But good safety records do not necessarily guarantee safety in the future. There is a national standard for the glass used in outer parts of structures (as a curtain wall for a building for example) but no special standard for the glass used in glass-bottomed walkways. I do not mean to raise unnecessary alarm, but without a national standard no one can ensure safety forever on the "glass paths".
Besides, people tend to equal the risk with glass-bottomed bridges to the cracking of glass and people falling into the ravines. But that is not the only risk.
On April 9, the overcrowding on a glass-bottomed bridge in Mulanshengtian tourism zone in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, amidst heavy rainfall caused an accident in which one person died and three were injured. The incident should be a lesson for us. Regular safety checks must be conducted to test the strength and durability of such walkways, while the maintenance and supervision staff should be fully trained to know under what conditions the walkways should be closed and how to deal with emergencies.
Besides, not everybody is fit to walk on such "glass paths", because looking down into a deep ravine might raise a person's blood pressure, increasing the risk of a heart attack. In fact, several reports have said tourists started crying out in fear on such walkways. The tourist sites with such walkways should therefore display clear safety instructions so that visitors know the risks and people with unfavorable health conditions stay away from them.
Only a comprehensive safety system can ensure tourists' safety on glass-bottomed bridges.
Gong Jian, an associate professor at Wuhan Branch of China Tourism Academy

The lottery will guarantee "transparent and fair distribution" of units, and is part of the city's measures to curb speculation in the housing market.
Shanghai's housing regulator also said real estate developers, agents and sales companies are forbidden from getting involved in speculative home sales.
The authorities concerned will blacklist firms and individuals that violate the rules.
Property firms and agents need to carry out only genuine, verifiable deals and prevent transactions involving fictitious names aimed at circumventing purchase limits, said the circular, which was issued late on Thursday.
Analysts said the lottery system will benefit buyers of smaller, lower-priced properties that are in limited supply and hence in high demand.
The lottery system also requires that transactions be notarized to ensure fair and transparent distribution of market-oriented housing projects.
The lottery system has been widely applied already in the distribution of subsidized government housing for lower-income families and low-rent houses.
"When supply (of new homes) doesn't meet demand, a notarized lottery system will work better than any other system. Unnotarized lottery systems used to lead to underhand dealings in the past, and scalpers would enter the market to resell home purchase qualifications. Now, the new system will maximize protection for homebuyers," said Yan Yuejin, a senior researcher with the E-house China R&D Institute.
Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with Centaline Property, said the lottery system supplements existing home purchase restrictions in Shanghai. It is likely to be adopted by other cities facing similar demand-supply mismatches.
Shanghai's new homes inventory by April-end stood at 6.28 million square meters, which would be absorbed by the market in nine months, if there are no more supplies, E-house data showed.
In Shanghai, stricter limits have been imposed on homebuyers' qualifications and down payment requirements to stabilize prices.

As an emergency room doctor, you never know what's coming through that door. It could be someone with stab wounds, a baby in distress, bus accident victims or an elderly man with pneumonia.
"The best part about being a doctor for emergency department is that moment when you know you've changed someone's life positively. Sometimes, it's something small, not what most people think of as life-saving, but it's lifesaving to that person," says Xu Jin.
Xu Jin has been an emergency room doctor since July 2005, and now he serves as the attending doctor in the emergency department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
"We take care of patients of every age from the moment of birth to grandmas and grandpas in their 90s," he says. "There is no type of injury, medical, surgical, obstetrical, psychiatric or pediatric condition that we aren't equipped to care for."
Today's emergency department looks after so much more than other departments that some people have started calling us, the "everything department", Xu says.
"We care for everything. Regardless of what brings a patient to the emergency department, it's my job to look after them," he says.

PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Saturday that the latest US-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint military drills were "unprecedentedly hideous and most adventurous ones" in several decades.
In a military commentary, the official Korean Central News Agency said the US and ROK have made it public that all their joint military drills aimed to "remove the leadership" of the DPRK and "bring down its system."
These exercises had "thrown away their deceptive veils as annual drills and defensive ones," it said.
"The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills revealed that the new Trump administration, too, is resorting to the hostile policy toward the DPRK by use of force, tougher sanctions and pressure," it said.
The US and ROK have just concluded two-month-long joint military drills involving 300,000 troops.
The US has also sent its aircraft carrier task group USS Carl Vinson and a nuclear submarine to waters off the Korean peninsula, besides carrying out nuclear bomb dropping drills in ROK and test launching two intercontinental ballistic missile within one week from California to the Western Pacific over the past two weeks.

Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates a point during her victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci at last week's WTA Stuttgart Grand Prix. Reuters
LONDON - Maria Sharapova might have to wait until June 20 to see if she will be welcomed back to Wimbledon this year. 
Sharapova, the 2004 champion at the All England Club, returned to the WTA Tour last week after serving a 15-month ban for doping and reached the semifinals in Stuttgart, leaving her ranked No 262. 
The Russian's return has sparked controversy on the tour, with some rivals saying she has been given preferential treatment. 
The former world No 1 is set to play two more events, in Madrid and Rome, before the deadline for direct entry to Wimbledon qualifying. 
Deep runs at those events could earn her enough points to make the main draw, while she will also find out on May 16 if she gets a wild card for the French Open. 
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said on Wednesday there will be a meeting of the tournament's sub-committee on June 20, when it will be clear which players have been accepted into the main draw. 
Wimbledon begins on July 3, its latest start since 1895. 
Andy Murray, the world's No 1 men's player, said he expects Sharapova to be granted a wild card if she needs one. 
"But I'm sure they are hoping they don't have to make the decision," Murray said at the launch of the Queen's Club tournament, a warm-up event for Wimbledon. 
"There's a good chance that she can get in by right, which I'm sure is what she's hoping for and that's what Wimbledon would be hoping for." 
Lewis said qualifying at nearby Roehampton would be a ticketed event for the first time, and that action on one of the courts will be broadcast live. 
He said this was not linked to the possible appearance of Sharapova, but because of the upsurge in interest in qualifying matches. 
Lewis also announced there will be a 12.5 percent increase in total Wimbledon prize money, to $40.8 million. 
Winners of the singles titles will each pocket $2.85 million, a 10 percent increase from 2016. 
First-round losers will receive $45,000, a 16.7 percent increase from 2016, as Wimbledon officials say they are placing more emphasis on helping lower-ranked players. 
In another development, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said two-time Wimbledon finalist Ilie Nastase will not be invited to the Royal Box on Centre Court. 
The 70-year-old Romanian has been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation following his comments about the skin color of the baby Serena Williams is expecting, and his foul-mouthed outbursts during a recent Fed Cup match between Romania and Britain. 
"What he did, we have to say, his actions were not very good and we condemn them," Brook said. 
Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Williams' unborn baby when he said: "Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?" 
The two-time Grand Slam winner also asked British captain Anne Keothavong for her hotel room number and verbally abused umpire Jaume Campistol and referee Andreas Egli before swearing at Keothavong and British player Johanna Konta as he was banished from the court. 
Nastase was escorted out by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie. 
A national icon in Romania, Nastase defied the ban by briefly returning the following day. He pointedly refused to apologize in the immediate aftermath of the controversy, saying he had no regrets. 
Nastase, who twice finished as runner-up at Wimbledon in the 1970s, is awaiting sanction by the International Tennis Federation after being hit with a provisional suspension.

Students from Guangxi University of Science and Technology play with pupils in Tantou township, Liuzhou city, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in July. English, dancing, painting and calligraphy classes were held for the pupils during summer vacation. Tan Kaixing / for China Daily
The pupils are watched by tens of thousands of people nationwide. It reminds us of the movie The Truman Show, where the main character lives in an artificial mini-world where he is watched by a worldwide audience around the clock.
The difference is, at the end of the movie Truman escapes from the artificial world in which he has been living, but the pupils are still being watched by audiences nationwide even though the media has exposed the voyeurism.
Legally speaking, school authorities that install cameras in classrooms and dormitories and provide video to live broadcast websites violate pupils' rights, because they invade the children's privacy without their consent.
According to reports, some of the schools argued they obtained consent from the pupils' parents when installing the cameras. The problem is, even though the pupils are minors they have the right to their own privacy, and so the consent of their parents is not valid. More important, the schools did not tell the parents that videos would be provided to live broadcast websites to be streamed nationwide.
Some "experts" have even claimed the pupils are attending a class and classrooms are public areas, so such broadcasts are not infringing on their privacy. Such opinions are nonsense because they totally ignore the pupils' legal right to privacy and the fact that classrooms are not public spaces to which everyone has the right of access.
China has been constantly improving the rule of law and made many achievements in the past few years. But it seems, teachers and schools need reminding they must respect the legal rights of their pupils. If the pupils realize their privacy and legal rights are being violated in such a way, how can they trust the rule of law?

PARIS - Polling stations opened on France's European mainland on Sunday for a decisive round of the presidential election between centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-rightist Marine Le Pen.
More than 66,000 polling stations in the French European mainland opened at 08:00 local time (0600 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 20:00 (1800 GMT) in big cities, while the rest will close at 19:00 (1700 GMT).
Nearly 47 million voters are expected to cast their ballots.
French voters in overseas territories casted their votes on Saturday, but the results will be only known after all votes are casted on the mainland.
Official campaigning period ended Friday night, signalling the start of a blackout on any campaigning activities, according to French electoral law.
The law bans the publication of any early poll or counting results of the vote before all polling stations are closed.
Preliminary projections of the voting results are expected to be revealed by various sources after 20:00.
Macron and Le Pen topped the first round vote of the election on April 23, with 24.01 percent and 21.30 percent of votes, respectively.
Several major French opinion polls conducted after the first round have been consistent, which estimate that former economy minister Macron is likely to win the runoff after an intense campaign against Le Pen.

The 4th Xinghao Youth Script and Creative Designing Competition and Award Ceremony was held at the Beiguo Theater of Beijing Normal University on May 4 as a part of the 24th Beijing College Student Film Festival.
"A successful film may involve many factors such as a good director, popular performers or brilliant visual effects, but a failed one must have a close relationship with the quality of a certain script," Wang Hailin, renowned Chinese playwright, said at the competition.
"College students represent the most vigorous and passionate group in the entire society. When you devote yourselves to writing scripts, you may be faced with many temptations like money, power, glory or status, but you should not forget your original will, and stick to your dream," he added.
Since its call for scripts one month ago, a total of 540 creative scripts from various fields were sent by students from many top universities, including Beijing Film Academy, The Central Academy of Drama, Shanghai Theatre Academy, Communication University of China, Peking University, Fudan University.
Eighteen candidates’ scripts were selected for the final competition. There were three second prize winners, five third prize winners and 10 consolation prizes awarded.

A potential homebuyer checks out a property project in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Dec 17, 2016. [Asianewsphoto by Long Wei]
BEIJING HAS INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES to cool its real estate market. At least eight banks have raised their mortgage interest rates, and five no longer accept personal applications for loans if their pledges are commercial real estate. The Mirror, a Beijing-based newspaper, comments:




These cooling measures come at the right time. As property prices in the capital have continuously risen, hot money rushed into the realty market. If that trend continues, the ever-growing bubble in the housing market would pose a challenge to the national economy.
The falling number of secondhand house deals best shows that the measures are quite effective. According to realty agencies, the number of secondhand house deals registered via online platforms in April was 16,902, 35 percent lower than the figure in March and 36 percent lower year-on-year.
But while applauding the firm actions taken by the authorities to curb speculation, we also hope they can take into consideration the needs of those who sell smaller apartments to buy a bigger one to meet their needs.
According to the current regulations, these people need to pay higher down payments as well as higher interest rates for their housing loans, even the tax and administrative fees for their deals are higher.
Some people want to buy a bigger apartment because they have growing families. Such buyers are not speculators. It is time to distinguish them from speculators and consider giving them tax incentives and other favorable policies.
On Wednesday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, announced its 2017 legislative work plan, according to which a property tax will be considered. By taxing those who own two or more houses, a property tax would be an effective way to curb speculation.
That move is also long-term because it will be part of the law. We look forward to the introduction of a property tax as it will help root out speculation from the realty market.

Mi Ying poses for a photo near gas production equipment on Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field, Southwest China's Chongqing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]
For her, it's all about numbers. She starts her day by reading operation data from all her "children", the shale gas wells. Apart from analyzing data on computer screens, most of her time is spent going from one well to another, climbing up and down, walking far or squatting for a long time, bending down or looking up, to take notes on the numbers.
She is Mi Ying, a technician working at Sinopec's Fuling shale gas field in Southwest China's Chongqing. She is also a young mother of a 3-year-old girl, and she's shy when answering a question on which one gets more attention - the gas wells or her daughter. Because the answer is fairly clear: the former.
31-year-old Mi is from Northwest China's Shaanxi province, having set up a family in Chongqing, and has been working on this shale gas field for three years. "For everyone here, shale gas is their child," Mi told chinadaily.com.cn.
But for Mi, a young mother whose pregnancy nearly coincides with the start of China's shale gas commercial production, she may have a better understanding.
Mi graduated from Xi'an Shiyou University in Shaanxi with a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering in 2008. Upon graduation, she was employed by Sinopec Jianghan Oilfield and began her career at a gas production plant in a remote town in Central China's Hunan province.
In 2014 when Sinopec launched China's first shale gas commercial production program in Fuling, Mi decided to join forces with this new but promising cause. It was her stellar performance at the plant in the past five years that opened the door for her in Fuling.
She came to Fuling with 200,000 words of notes written in over 10 notebooks to work on optimizing gas production through monitoring and data analysis.
But shale gas production was new to China at the time, and American experiences gained in deserts can't be fully applied to the mountainous area of Fuling.
She raced against time while looking up scientific literature in this field and racked her brain to solve problems in production. In half a year, her nickname "Xiaomi" became a brand in the field and her and her colleagues' research achievements helped optimize production which translated into profits of 70 million yuan ($10 million).
And she did all this while pregnant. But this wasn't all: she impressed everyone with her decision to conclude her maternity leave earlier than the stipulated date. She accommodated her daughter and her mother-in-law in a rental home in the town near the gas field.
"I would have loved to take longer leave with my daughter but we were indeed short of hands at that time," Mi calmly told chinadaily.com.cn with more maturity than her age.
She was awarded for her dedication to shale gas production, including national awards honoring her as best young woman and best female worker.
But shy Mi said little about these awards, claiming she was just as ordinary as her colleagues, "There are many people on the shale gas field who might not be qualified for their role as parents or children, but they are all competent employees for the job."
Sinopec's Fuling shale gas project now has reached production capacity of seven billion cubic meters and is expected to achieve 10 billion by the end of this year. Their gas has been used in tens of millions of households reaching as far as Shanghai, about 2,000 km away, as well as Chongqing and six provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
Those enjoying their dinner cooked with the gas from Fuling may never personally know the young mother called Mi Ying behind this giant energy project. But her efforts and devotion to the future of energy are undeniable.
"I have to say I joined the industry as a coincidence as I was admitted to this major in college. But I have never had regrets about it, because I think it's meaningful to work in this field," said Mi. "As for my daughter, I will cherish the time I can spend with her."

Long seen as an anti-ageing treatment for women, more and more men are giving Botox – err, Brotox – a shot. [Photo provided to China Daily]
Enter Botox, a lethal neurotoxin (technically "botulinum toxin type A") that relaxes muscles via injection and was discovered to help reduce wrinkles by a California plastic surgeon in 1989. After a long period of formal trials, it was approved for use in the US in 2002 – and has since become a household name as the world's most common cosmetic procedure. 
Long used by women, in the early Botox days, there were few male clients; most did it for occupational reasons, such as actors and anchormen. Through wider acceptance in society, it has become more common for men in recent years. Some clinics in Hong Kong even claim that male clients compose 50% of their business today. The rise in popularity explains how the humorous nickname "Brotox" has entered the vernacular. 
Where do guys get their Brotox injected? They say the eyes are the key to the soul – and so the most popular areas address crow's feet and the vertical lines between the eyebrows. These lines can make a man look angry and unapproachable, which is why nine-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz, an open endorser of Botox, wanted to try it in the first place. In an interview with plastic surgery website Make Me Heal, Spitz explained, "I wasn't trying to look younger or different; I just wanted my face to portray how good I was feeling inside – instead of telling the world that I was perplexed or angry all the time." 
Concerned about "surprise lines" on your forehead? Those annoying, intractable lines can also make you look older than you actually are, so a considerable amount of Botox treatments are focused on this area. However, it's hard to completely remove them because this is an easy-to-crease area. 
Botox has been nicknamed the "lunchtime facelift" because it can be done in less than 15 minutes. Expect to see effects after two weeks of injection, with the best results after about a month. In Hong Kong, the standard practice is to have a consultation session with your doctor before deciding what areas to address and how many shots are needed. Fees are charged per area or per unit, depending on the clinic; locally, some start at HK$3,000 per treatment package of 10 units. You don't need to drastically change your routine or eating habits. Just avoid alcohol on the first day of injection and don't apply pressure to the area. So, what are your plans for lunch?

Tourists visit the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 6, 2017. [Photo/VCG]
The Palace Museum in Beijing, also known as the Forbidden City, will expand the sale of online tickets on a trial basis in July. 
The trial run will last from July to October to test the feasibility of online sales of tickets for everyday, but tourists can still buy tickets at the entrances, according to the museum. 
After the trial period, the Palace Museum will decide whether to phase out the sale of paper tickets and sell all tickets via the internet. 
The all online sale may begin during the last 10 days of October. 
By the May Day holiday in 2018, the museum may offer tickets for different periods throughout a day, in a bid to avoid too many tourists at a time. 
Currently, tourists can only book tickets online in advance, but they have to buy paper tickets at the entrances if they want to visit immediately. 
The Palace Museum began selling tickets online in September 2011. Currently about 50 percent of its tickets are sold online, with up to 70 percent booked online during holidays. 
The Palace Museum started to set a daily visitor cap of 80,000 on June 13, 2015. The cap was triggered 32 times in 2015, 48 in 2016, and 10 in 2017. 
Three steps to phase out sale of paper tickets 
Phase 1: Preparation 
Date: May - June 
Starting from May, the museum will allow online selling of tickets for everyday, after an upgrade of its online ticket selling system. 
Phase 2: Trial run 
Date: July - October 
The trial will test the feasibility of online sales of tickets, but tourists can also buy tickets at the entrances. Tourists can also buy tickets by scanning a QR code at the entrances. 
Phase 3: Implementation 
Date: From last 10 days of October 
A full online sale will be carried out at a proper date, when no paper tickets will be offered at the entrances anymore.

PARIS - The French electoral commission, which supervises the country's presidential race, on Saturday warned local media not to republish data and information hacked from centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign staff.
In a statement, the commission asked media not to report the content of the leaked documents on their websites, stressing that publishing false information would be punished under criminal law.
Late on Friday, Macron's campaign team said it had been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking attack," leading to the diffusion of "various internal information" on social media.
The leaked documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, it added.
However, the files posted online mixed authentic documents with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation," according to Macron's En Marche! (On the Move!) party.
The alleged hacking of the leading political party in the presidential race came on the eve of the election's run-off on Sunday.
Pollsters predict Macron to beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen with large margin.
In February, Macron's staff said their campaign had been the target of cyber attacks targeting databases and e-mail servers.

Launched by President Xi Jinping in September 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is designed to improve global connectivity and physical infrastructure to better link China with the rest of Asia, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The initiative envisages the creation of multiple economic corridors under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.




In the past four years, the Belt and Road Initiative has gradually gained traction with new projects and financing coming on stream, such as the flagship 418-kilometer rail link with Laos and the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. While it's hard to quantify the total number of projects and amount of financing, the China Development Bank said it alone had reserved $890 billion for more than 900 projects in 2015, highlighting the magnitude of the undertaking.
Indeed, while new multilateral institutions such as the AIIB have started to play an active role in project financing, most of the funding for the initiative's projects is actually bilateral. In addition to that from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, we estimate that the "big-four" State-owned banks extended $90 billion loans to the economies along the initiative's two routes in 2016. Thus, bilateral financing from China's commercial and policy banks dwarfs multilateral financing and we expect that to remain the case in the future.
Nevertheless, even the combined annual bilateral and multilateral financing flows, including those from international multilateral institutions (such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) are modest compared to infrastructure spending and needs in the vast region covered by the initiative (the Asian Development Bank estimates the annual infrastructure investment needs at $1.7 trillion until 2030).
That said, the initiative-generated infrastructure will benefit some of the least developed parts of the world, and improved infrastructure should facilitate trade and investment, create new market demand and contribute to global development. While we estimate the region covered by the initiative will contribute 80 percent of global GDP growth by 2050, up from 68 percent in 2016, our fairly constructive projection of growth in the region is subject to downside risks, including those from global trade protectionism and, domestically, from supply side constraints, which, however, can be reduced by infrastructure development, and regional trade and investment collaboration.
Of course, China needs to make sure its engagement with other countries does not become unbalanced. Especially, it needs to ensure its manufacturing exports to the economies along the two routes do not crowd out domestic production and result in trade deficits that could lead to economic and/or political tensions. In fact, while the share of China's exports to the region covered by the initiative has grown steadily, from 23 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2016, the share of China's imports from the economies along the two routes has fallen in recent years (measured in US dollars)－partly because of the drop in commodity prices, though.
We expect Chinese construction companies to largely benefit from the initiative through new sources of demand abroad, but we don't expect it to have a major impact on mopping up excess capacity in China's heavy industry, because the annual demand for heavy industrial products in the initiative-generated projects will be small compared to the scale of overcapacity in China's heavy industries.
In conclusion, China has devoted significant amounts of political capital, energy and financial resources to the initiative, and it has made some notable progress over the past four years. And although the initiative's short-term macro impact is likely to be modest, if well managed, we expect it to support long-term growth and development in the economies involved. The initiative can also increase China's international influence by providing a platform for it to enhance its role in global financial governance, and eventually help the internationalization of the yuan by encouraging its use in both trade and financial transactions, albeit under the condition that China liberalizes its capital account.

Liu Guoqun's father, Liu Wanyong (center), and other family members bid farewell to the helicopter carrying the woman's donated organs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Thursday. It was the first step in a transplant relay. TIAN JIANMING/CHINA DAILY
It was the first time a relay involving both a helicopter and a commercial jet had been attempted, and it was all made possible by the generosity of a grieving family who had just lost a young woman in the flower of youth.
In a hospital in Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, a 21-year-old woman named Liu Guoqun, who had sustained a mortal head injury in an accident on April 25, was declared brain dead by doctors after efforts to save her failed.
Liu's family gathered at her bedside, and her parents struggled with what to do, but finally came to the decision to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas to benefit others.
"I believe my daughter's life will continue on through the transplants," her father, Liu Wanyong, told China Central Television.
Soon, candidates to receive the organs were found in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, 80 kilometers away, and in Beijing, a distance of 1,220 km.
But time was short, and ground transportation was out of the question. A heart, which was the organ needed in Beijing, must be used within five hours. A relay plan was hastily organized.
A helicopter rushed all the organs to Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou within 26 minutes on Thursday morning, the CCTV report said.
An Air China passenger jet, flight CA 1711 to Beijing, was delayed for 23 minutes and took off as soon as the heart was aboard the plane.
The helicopter then whisked the remaining organs to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It arrived in 12 minutes and the organs were rushed to operating rooms, where doctors and their patients waited.
The woman's liver and two kidneys were transplanted, giving three patients a new lease on life.
While the heart arrived in Beijing in time, doctors performing tests needed before the transplant found "functional inadequacies" in the organ that ruled out its use, the report said. The patient would have to continue to wait.
Two patients will get the woman's corneas, restoring their sight, on Tuesday.
"It was a great effort," said Wang Jian'an, the head of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
"It is China's first helicopter-and-plane relay to transport organs. All departments and organizations gave a green light on transportation."

Juventus players celebrate blanking Monaco 2-0 in Wednesday's UEFA Champions League semifinal first-leg match at Stade Louis II in Monaco. Jean - Paul Pelissier / Reuters
Higuain brace has Italians eyeing Cardiff 
MONACO - Gonzalo Higuain urged his Juventus teammates to keep their feet on the ground after he scored both goals in a brilliant 2-0 win in Monaco on Wednesday that left the Italian squad on the brink of the Champions League final. 
Argentine striker Higuain was set up by Dani Alves to open the scoring in the 29th minute, then converted an Alves cross just before the hour as Juve claimed a crucial victory in the semifinal first leg at Stade Louis II. 
The Italian champion has the final in Cardiff on June 3 in its sights, with a showdown against holder Real Madrid, Higuain's former side, looking probable. 
"The dream we have been pursuing since August has been to get to Cardiff and we are just one step away," said Higuain, who now has 31 goals this season following his $98 million transfer from Napoli. 
"We have not won anything yet, so we mustn't get carried away," added Higuain, who ended a seven-game run without scoring in the Champions League knockout stages. 
"I stayed calm. I knew everyone had faith in me and that hard work is always rewarded in the end." 
Juventus shone in all areas against a Monaco side that has lit up Europe this season with a thrilling brand of attacking soccer. 
Buffon still strong 
But the host found Juve's defense rock solid, with Gianluigi Buffon majestic as ever in goal. 
The 39-year-old, making his 149th European appearance, denied Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao in the first half and produced a stunning fingertip stop on Valere Germain late in the second. 
Juventus, which welcomes Monaco to Turin for the second leg next Tuesday, has now gone over 10 hours without conceding in the Champions League and Buffon has blanked the opposition in five matches in the knockout rounds. 
"In every game I want to show that I deserve to play at this level despite my age," said Buffon, twice a losing finalist in the Champions League. 
"I work hard every day for this. The day I quit, I want people to be sad about it. 
"We had the right approach. They are a fearsome team and the only way to beat them was playing the way we did." 
Buffon also praised coach Massimiliano Allegri for his decision to bring Andrea Barzagli into a three-man defense, thwarting Monaco's attack and allowing Alves to wreak havoc down the right. 
"Gigi showed that he is still a great goalkeeper. He always does it in big games, and Higuain scored two lovely goals," said Allegri. 
"But to get results, everyone needs to work hard. You need to make sacrifices and track back and he did that too." 
'More clinical' 
Juventus could wrap up a record sixth consecutive Serie A title this weekend, when it faces city rival Torino, while Lazio awaits in the Italian Cup final. 
To put its performance in the principality into context, Monaco had won its previous 13 home games and scored in 41 consecutive matches at Stade Louis II since November 2015. 
"They were more clinical than us - with two or three chances they scored and we couldn't put any of ours away. Buffon made some incredible saves," said Monaco head coach Leonardo Jardim, who sorely missed injured marauding leftback Benjamin Mendy. 
Now Monaco must attempt to become just the third team ever to overturn a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League. 
"It is difficult, but we need to keep believing. The best thing is to believe it is possible, even if we only have a five percent chance," Jardim added. 
In the meantime, Monaco will switch its focus back to its attempt to win the French title. 
It plays Nancy on Saturday and needs two wins from its last four league games to become champion.

China National Chemical Corp, also known as ChemChina, said on Friday that shareholders of Syngenta AG, the Swiss agrochemical and seed producer, have accepted its $43 billion takeover bid, paving the way for completion of China's biggest international acquisition deal. 

Based on preliminary numbers, 80.7 percent of shares were tendered in favor of the acquisition, higher than the minimum acceptance rate of 67 percent needed for the deal to go through, ChemChina said in a statement 

The first payment settlement is scheduled for May 18. 

The Chinese company plans to delist Syngenta's shares in Switzerland and the United States at an appropriate time. 

"The completion of this deal will help ChemChina become one of the world's largest suppliers of pesticides and other crop-care chemicals," said Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. 

However, Ding said Dow Chemical Co's merger with DuPont Co and Bayer AG's purchase of Monsanto Co, which occurred in the past two years, would continue to provide intense market competition with ChemChina, as the top six international suppliers including Syngenta and BASF SE, have all been vying for market share and financial resources to push research and development of new products. 

Zhang Xiaoping, director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, said China could use Syngenta's deep experience and resources in intellectual property, risk control and environmental management to bring its products to global markets. 

"On the other hand, Syngenta will have better access than other global companies to sell its products in our domestic markets," said Xu Hongcai, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. 

"China's pesticide industry is riddled with low profitability and only global scale can improve that." 

The government pins high hopes on the reform to solve structural issues in the agricultural sector, where some agricultural products are oversupplied while others rely heavily on imports. 

China has been encouraging its companies to use both domestic and global resources to ensure the country's grain and food security in its agricultural policy. 

Niu Dun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said earlier this year that the deal would generate a positive outcome for China to upgrade its abilities in grain and food production, supply chain building and processing. 

Syngenta has 28,000 employees in more than 90 countries and regions. Its sales revenue dropped 1 percent year-on-year to $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017. 

Beijing-headquartered ChemChina possesses production, research and development, and marketing systems in 150 countries and regions. Materials sciences, life sciences, high-end manufacturing and basic chemicals are its main businesses. 

It also acquired nine companies in France, the United Kingdom, Israel, Italy and Germany.

C919, China's homegrown large passenger jet, takes off on its maiden flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. [Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily]
The successful maiden flight of the C919, a single-aisle homegrown passenger jet, is expected to provide a major impetus to the domestic airplane manufacturing industry.
With more than 100,000 components for the plane, more than 240 local companies have served as suppliers and manufacturers for the C919 aircraft.
Once the C919 plane starts mass production and delivery, it is expected to drive the rapid growth of the upstream and downstream industry chains and other high-end manufacturing sectors, such as metal materials, metallurgical processing and dynamic controls.
Some cities, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanchang, Shenyang and Shanghai, have become involved in the production and assembly of the aircraft.
All of them have formed aviation industry clusters and they are about to achieve faster development following the mass production of the C919, according to its manufacturer－the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Harbin Hafei Industry Co Ltd, an aviation manufacturer in Harbin, Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, is mainly responsible for the manufacturing work of some parts that mainly use composite materials.
These parts include the hatch door for the front landing gear, the hatch door for the main landing gear and the vertical tail of the C919.
Li Wei, deputy chief engineer of the C919 project at Hafei, said: "Once the C919 aircraft starts large-scale production, it will effectively drive the output value of Hafei."
Earlier, Hafei was mainly responsible for manufacturing helicopters. Despite its rich experience in airplane production, the company still faces a lot of technical challenges for the C919 plane.
"The C919 aircraft has an advanced design concept, which makes it more difficult for manufacturing techniques. The manufacturing process for the plane has helped us significantly increase our experience and abilities in dealing with composite materials," she said.
"Enterprises will be able to take a leading position in the fierce market competition, if they can grab the opportunities in the C919 project and supporting sectors," Li said.
By 2030, the demand of single-aisle aircraft is expected to reach 14,500 worldwide and China has a demand of about 2,650, according to an industry forecast.
Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035.
After its maiden flight, the C919 will also launch a series of test flights, complete its technical verification tests and then enter the period of mass production and delivery in the next few years.
So far, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines.
Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany, Thailand and Africa.

Some of it is art. But fundamentally, I entertain
Mulling this over, I get the nod that Scott is ready for me. Walking into the suite, I find him rearranging the furniture. “I can’t have those soft chairs,” he explains, his accent a bit Stockton, a bit Hollywood. “They’re no good for my back.” If, as Alan Parker suggests, you are struggling to place the face, Scott has something of the Bryan Cranston about him. His hair, once rusty red, is gradually turning metallic silver, his moustache holding out longest. He’s 5ft 7in, give or take, and is dressed today in his standard film-set attire: black fleece jacket and sensible shoes.
Why, I wonder aloud, don’t we see more of Scott? He looks perplexed by the inquiry, perhaps understandably, but answers gnomically: “I do enough.”
And, in a way, I’ve got my answer as to why Scott makes his films and then keeps his head down.
The script that Scott read had an all-male crew, but there was a change of heart at 20th Century Fox and two of the characters were switched to women, including Ellen Ripley, the last surviving member of the ship. “I cast Ripley really late,” says Scott. “Two weeks out, we still hadn’t found her. Then somebody came up, I think it was Warren Beatty, and said, ‘There’s this woman, on off-Broadway, on the theatre boards called Sigourney Weaver, you should meet with her. Interesting.’ So I called her, went to New York, she walks in, she must have been 6ft 6in, with an afro, so she’s 7ft 2in. And I was like a midget, and I had dinner with her. That was it!”
Neither Scott nor Weaver, apparently, realised it, but Ripley would become an iconic heroine. “It hadn’t dawned on me,” admits Scott. “After the event, I went, ‘Oh, OK, yeah, absolutely,’ but I never thought about that.”
Being in Berlin seems to have put Scott in a reflective mood and, without much prompting, he starts to talk about his childhood. His father Francis was a colonel in the Royal Engineers and the family spent five years in West Germany after the war as part of the Marshall plan. They lived in a house so grand it had a library and Scott went to boarding school in Wilhelmshaven, where he used to watch U-boats in the North Sea: “I loved it.” Francis was offered the prestigious position of head of port authority for the Elbe, based in Hamburg, but Scott’s mother wanted to return home to be near her relatives. Scott smiles, “I remember saying, at eight-and-a-half: ‘Take the job. You’re making the wrong decision.’ But it wasn’t to be, and we went back to Stockton-on-Tees and ended up on a council estate.
“My dad was a great guy, he did the right thing for the family, but he was not a happy man for the rest of his life,” Scott goes on. “And the interesting thing is that nobody said anything. We just looked at the house, pebble dash, move in and that’s it, dude. You’d get on with it.”
Back in the north-east, Scott went to a secondary modern school. He struggled academically; only later did he think that he might be slightly dyslexic. “After being bottom for five years, I decided that I wasn’t academically sound – for anything, truly. And I was really trying. I wasn’t lazy. I just couldn’t retain anything that I wasn’t interested in. If I’m interested, I’ve got a photographic brain. I could walk out of this room and in a year, I could draw it right down to the paintings on the wall.”
Tony Scott killed himself in 2012, jumping from a suspension bridge in Los Angeles. Ridley later revealed that Tony had cancer. “Being an elder brother, if ever there was an argument about anything, I’d back off, always,” says Scott now. “Nothing’s worth losing a relationship over. So I’d always back down, say, ‘OK, then.’” He laughs affectionately, “He was like the spoiled brat really.
Family is Scott’s one great concern outside of films – his other big passion in life was tennis, which he played very competitively, always singles, well into his 70s, until he blew his knees. He is married to the Costa Rican actor Giannina Facio, his third wife, and they move between houses in Los Angeles, London and the Luberon in Provence. He has three grown-up children – Jake, Luke and Jordan – all of whom have followed him into the business, either in films or advertising. It is little surprise then that Scott has felt the loss of his brother keenly. He often called Tony the one person in Hollywood he could trust – and he still thinks of him every time he finishes a project.
“They are quite different as people, but they are both very smart. You better do your homework. Or you better have your point of view, because if you don’t, they’re going to stomp on you. When they say, ‘Why would I do that?’ you better have a bloody good answer.”
“It all comes full circle to starting out as a painter. You walk in the room in the morning, where you spent all day yesterday by yourself. You stare at the canvas and you go: ‘Bloody hell, I hate it.’ Painting is all about what you did yesterday, how you’re going to recorrect it, improve it, or go: ‘Holy shit, I got it.’” He pauses, perhaps remembering Pauline Kael and her real or imagined slights against his beard. “It’s being your own critic, that’s it. That’s the most important thing.”
Scott is well known for his time-keeping and, today, ours is up. After the current round of press requirements, he will again disappear. Back to his films, until the next time. It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy the attention, he just doesn’t need it. “Thanks,” he says, as I get up to leave, “but you know I won’t read it, don’t you?”

The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”

This system is deemed to be democratic because people elect governments and can always vote them out; it’s capitalist because corporations are constrained by the logic of competition, which prizes efficiency, innovation and infinite expansion. That logic, with its penchant for creative destruction of all things stale and permanent, can produce toxic results – which is precisely why government action is needed. Such, at any rate, is the social democratic consensus accepted by both centre-left and centre-right parties.
The questions of war and security – and the existential imperatives that they impose on the most democratic of societies – have always posed unresolved challenges to this framework, as can be glimpsed from occasional warnings about the military-industrial complex expressed by many a political insider nearing retirement. Thus, standard democratic procedures are regularly suspended as governments demand tighter control over the flow of information, classify more of their internal communications and expand surveillance without any requisite checks and balances.
The standard critique of such practices attacks the undemocratic-because-unaccountable activities of the so-called “deep state”. Rooted in campaigns to defend privacy, opponents aim to make the deep state shallower – ideally by means of legal interventions aimed at restoring transparency and accountability. The real problem, they argue, is with the malfunctioning of democracy – we could easily ignore the capitalist part of “democratic capitalism”: we just need more and better legal instruments to tame the intelligence agencies.
Governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies – they are engaging in toxic activities of their own
Alas, the world in 2017 is not so easy to pigeonhole into the neat compartments of this scheme. Consider just one example: cyber-security. Plenty of rogue states are, indeed, busy hacking the servers of their adversaries in western Europe or North America. Likewise, there’s no denying that non-state hackers, operating for commercial or patriotic motives, have damaged their targets.
They do this for motives that some might view as noble: to identify early signs of terrorist activity, to track down criminals, to disable devices that might be part of sophisticated plots to wreak havoc on our cities. Whatever the motives, we should not lose sight of the larger political effects produced by such actions.
First, the expansion (and even the maintenance) of the surveillance capabilities of democratic governments presupposes a permanent structural insecurity of our communication networks. That insecurity, in turn, gets exploited not just by democratic governments but by anyone else, including all those rogue states and non-state hackers. However, once insecurity is structural, the right response is not more security, but more insurance. This explains why cyber-insurance has become one of the most promising segments of the insurance market, with even sectors like manufacturing (itself increasingly wired up and interconnected) needing to spend more and more to insure against disruptive cyber-attacks.
In essence, cyber-insurance – like any other form of insurance – is a domain of rentiers who are keen to extract a regular premium payment from those needing their services. The truly innovative element here is that the risk that creates this new class of rentiers exists partly – and, one could even say, mostly – because of government activity.
Here, the logic of democratic capitalism is no more: governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies; rather, they engage in toxic activities of their own, which companies mitigate with activities that are either more or less toxic – depending on one’s views about the parasitic nature of economic activities pursued by rentiers. The second political effect of the ever-expanding surveillance apparatus is the disadvantage it creates for small companies and non-profits, not to mention individuals. Remember the early utopian vision of a digital world, where we would all be running our own mail servers and, with time, might even master our own version of the connected home?
Well, today we demand more autonomy at our own risk: given the sophistication of cyber-attacks – which both aim to steal data and overwhelm sites with fake traffic – it’s obvious that the only actors capable of defending ordinary users, be they individuals or corporations, are big tech firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This, too, violates the basic premise of democratic capitalism: citizens are encouraged to seek protection from companies, not governments.
When both spam and security threats are assessed using the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, one can forget about any other, smaller player being able to compete with such firms that use the structural insecurity created by governments to further consolidate their near-monopoly status.
Democratic capitalism is thus always democratic monopoly capitalism – and even more so in its digital version. The idea that the normal imperatives of capitalist competition would exert extra pressure on digital giants seems quaint. There’s no garage big enough to house a startup that can unseat Google, not with its trove of customer data and artificial intelligence.
The third effect of this new post-democratic compromise is that, in presenting cyber-insecurity as a natural rather than human-made problem, it delegitimises the role of law – and politics in general – in mitigating conflicts between citizens and corporations. Consider how we deal with other types of disasters. It would be imprudent to rely on the power of law and politics to ward off floods and earthquakes; insurance, under these conditions, is not an unreasonable option. But none of this prevents us from requiring stricter building standards so as to minimise the damage when the disaster does strike.
The world of cyber-security does not follow this logic. Imagine if the government regularly dispatched a group of well-paid and well-educated saboteurs to weaken the anti-flood or anti-earthquake defences of our houses, leaving us no option but to turn to the private sector for security, either in the form of better defences or better insurance. This is the situation we are in right now; the only difference is that cyber-security disasters are almost entirely human-made and thus avoidable.
Rhetorically, the governments might even agree that, in the face of all these dangers, we all need to strengthen our privacy laws. In reality, though, we all know that it would only result in them sending even more saboteurs – with even more powerful tools – to weaken our defences. Who, under these conditions, would retain any faith in law and politics, rather than accept protections promised by the market, however flawed and expensive?
Cyber-security, alas, is just one of the many examples where the legitimacy of democratic capitalism – as well as of the social democratic parties that have traditionally defended it – has expired, even if its talking points are still in circulation. No wonder that social democratic parties are collapsing, as elections in the Netherlands and France have shown: they claim to be defending a system that no longer walks the talk.

The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.

What is it about Italian coaches? Certainly, Serie A offers them the comprehensive grounding. Paul Pogba, the Manchester United midfielder, who spent four seasons at Juventus, described Italy’s top division as “the university of football, especially at a tactical level”. Then, there is Coverciano, the Italian Football Federation’s acclaimed technical centre and finishing school for managers.
“There is a good school in Italy but, honestly, when you arrive in England and you face this league, you must change your mind on a lot of things,” Conte says. “You must adapt very well and very quickly to this league. It is very difficult, very strong and it’s totally different to the Italian or Spanish leagues.
“In every single game, you must fight a lot. You must put all of yourself into every game and if you think you’re playing a team at a medium level you’re actually preparing for a defeat. For this reason it’s not easy [for an English team] to reach the end of a European competition. Also, for the national team, it’s very difficult to do very well in the World Cup or the Euros because you arrive at the end of the season and the players are tired.”
That is for the summer. For now, Conte is consumed by Middlesbrough and the final title push. It stands to lead him into elite company. “For sure, I looked at the past in England and I saw many Italian managers had won the title,” he says. “It’s great for our school and it’s logical to be proud, no? Last season, I supported Claudio Ranieri a lot to win the title and in Italy we celebrated this win in a great way.”

The finer details of the cash offer still needed to be ironed out and approved by the local council, Galliano wrote on his Facebook page. But if all goes ahead, from next year anyone who transfers their residence to Bormida and either rents or buys a property there will be gifted €2,000.
“We’re still working out the plan, but anyone is welcome to come and live here,” said a local councillor, who asked not to be named. “We’re a small community but very welcoming. We’re high up in a mountain area but also not far from the sea – it’s a healthy lifestyle, the air is very clean.”
But what is life like in Bormida? The manager of Oddone Giuseppe, one of the town’s four restaurants, said: “There is nothing much to do here. But life is so simple and natural, we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food. Life would definitely be free of stress.”
A report last year by Legambiente, an Italian environmental association, found that 2,500 villages across the country risked being abandoned owing to depopulation.
In January the culture ministry named 2017 the “year of the village” as part of an attempt to promote tourism in places at risk of becoming deserted.

Three Australian swimmers are facing two-year bans from all competitions for missing three drugs tests over a period of 12 months.
“Swimming Australia confirms it has recently been informed by Asada and Fina that members of the Australian Dolphins Swim team may have failed to update their whereabouts appropriately over the previous 12-month period,” the Australian team said in a statement on Sunday.
All athletes in registered drug testing pools of international federations and national anti-doping organisations are required to provide their whereabouts for one hour every day (between 5am-11pm) when they will be available for testing. Asada said that at the point of each missed test, athletes have the opportunity to put forward an explanation before a missed test declaration was made.
Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson said he would be disappointed if protocols weren’t followed by the swimmers. “Both Swimming Australia and our athletes have been very clear on our position in relation to anti-doping both here in Australia and internationally,” Anderson said in a statement. 
“The Australian Dolphins Swim Team has worked hard to develop a culture of professionalism and respect. Part of that professionalism is ensuring each athlete is accountable and responsible for accurately providing their locations so testers can access them when required. It is extremely disappointing if this has not occurred as it should.”

In June 2013, a young American postgraduate called Sophie was passing through London when she called up the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.
“That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.”
Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”
Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”
On that day in June 2013, Sophie met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she suggested he meet this firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.”
Who’s her father?
“Eric Schmidt.”
Eric Schmidt – the chairman of Google?
“Yes. And she suggested Alexander should meet this company called Palantir.”
I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of eBay and PayPal, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump.
In some ways, Eric Schmidt’s daughter showing up to make an introduction to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.
It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.
There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.
Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign.
What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.
It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”.
How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.”
AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished.
There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.
Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.”
He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said.
Who’s Chris Wylie?
“He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.”
There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.”
I did find Chris Wylie. He refused to comment.
Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”.
I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.
What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.
SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.
This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”
Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.
And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.
Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.
The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.”
Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.
But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?
“It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.”
Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.
“We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.”
A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform.
David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.”
These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”.
In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?
It makes me think again about the story involving Sophie Schmidt, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.
Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.
A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.
“On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.”
In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.
The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.
Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.
The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”.
On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook.
Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”.
And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.”
The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.
But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”.
And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer.
This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.”
Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.”
Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.
“He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.”
On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.
I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.
“I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.”
It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.
And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.
For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.
Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America.
Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.”
This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn’t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics. It’s about the first step into a brave, new, increasingly undemocratic world.

“We need to do away with this political class, which is all too often made of men over 50 who never had a proper job,” Macron has said, promising that his 577 parliamentary candidates will be half women and half political newcomers.
But if he doesn’t win a parliamentary majority, he will be plunged into horse-trading for a new type of coalition. He will need to be a very skilled politician to make it work and yet he says he hates politics and has little interest in it. “Being president of the Republic is not about loving politics, it’s about taking care of the French,” he has said, warning that previous presidents “loved politics too much” and that politics had become cut off from real people’s lives.
Becoming cut off has always been a risk for presidents who take over the gilded office at the grandiose Elysée palace, where the silence is punctuated by the sound of gold clocks chiming and the view from the leader’s desk is a vast expanse of manicured lawn behind high walls. “Of course power isolates,” Macron told an interviewer on the campaign trail, arguing that he would not let it happen to him.
--------------------------------------------------------用于测试，分隔不同的文章---------------------------------------------------------
Minutes before the legally enforced ending of the campaign, Macron’s movement issued a statement warning about a “massive hacking attack”. En Marche! explained that these documents had been hacked over a period of several weeks, that some of them were genuine and without any compromising content. Other documents in the data trove, however, appeared to have been fabricated.
Macron had already become, by far, the most targeted candidate by hackers during the campaign. In February, his movement’s computer systems were attacked by hackers based in Ukraine and needed to be shut down for several hours.
The timing is evidently aimed at bringing chaos to the last hours of the French campaign, but it is doubtful that the Macron leaks will have a real impact on the final result.
First of all, they are not a real surprise. French voters have already heard and read about the similar hacking attacks in France and other countries, notably during the US elections. And the spreading of fake news has become commonplace in France too.
Secondly, at first glance, no huge or obvious scandal seems to arise from the leak: journalists and experts will need months to properly study the content.
For months French voters have been living through a campaign full of twists and turns, violence and divisions. Families, friends and colleagues are divided and will remain so for some time
This latest attack is probably too obvious to substantially alter the result on Sunday and in fact, it might have the opposite effect from what the hackers had hoped for. This clear attempt to influence the democratic process might in fact convince some voters to turn up who had originally planned to abstain.

Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.

Cook said that there had been a “pause in purchases” due to “earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones”.
Apple reported iPhone sales of 50.8m in the first three months of 2017, down by 1% year-on-year. Its revenues grew 5% to $52.9bn, which was just below analysts’ forecasts of $53.1bn.
The company’s financial performance is heavily reliant on the iPhone. While it generated more than $33bn of sales in the quarter, a category it defines as “other products”, which includes the iPod, Apple TV and the Apple Watch, generated just $2.9bn.
While the Apple Watch may be popular with those who use it, it has certainly not created a new platform of customers for the company to meaningfully develop – not yet, anyway.
Reports in the technology industry suggest that the next iPhone will be a significant step forward. According to rumours, it could include wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. But even so, an upgrade to an existing product is unlikely to be a game-changer in the same way that the original iPhone was a decade ago, or the iPod and the iPad were.
It would be foolhardy to call this the peak for Apple, because you can never be sure what mystery products are lurking in its research and development buildings. However, it is clearly becoming more difficult for Apple, Samsung and others to expand the smartphone sector. The devices are now effectively a commodity, particularly in the western world. The market is for customers looking to upgrade every couple of years rather than those looking to buy their first handset.
But a slowdown in its biggest market makes the $250bn cash mountain that Apple is still sitting on even more intriguing.
Analysts at Citigroup, the investment bank, have drawn up a list of seven companies that Apple could buy with the cash. Their candidates are Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla, streaming service Hulu, and video game makers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive.
Some of these deals, such as Disney or the videogame makers, would basically be bolt-ons that would allow Apple to share the success these businesses already enjoy.
Buying Tesla, however, could be transformative and help Apple down the path towards transferring its technology to driverless and electric vehicles. Rumours suggest that Apple may already be working on an electric vehicle anyway.
Even if Apple does not do a deal, it seems its next move will be about bringing its technology closer to our everyday lives, whether through a car or turning its headphones into health monitors, another rumoured plan.
As smartphone sales slow, we are closer than ever to finding out what Apple’s next move will be.
It is true that the last of the five profits warnings in the past four years arrived a few weeks after the end of Pearson’s financial year, but it was a humdinger of a warning. It signalled a cut in the dividend this year, thereby removing the sole source of solace for investors during Fallon’s ill-starred reign. The share price, even after the bounce that accompanied the unveiling of yet another restructuring plan, has halved in little more than two years.
Fallon is correct that the remuneration committee sets his pay. Thus Elizabeth Corley, chair of that committee, and Sidney Taurel, group chairman, must take direct blame for a fiasco that saw almost two-thirds of voting shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Almost a third also opposed Pearson’s forward-looking pay policy. That level of opposition is extremely rare at FTSE 100 companies.
Corley also received a 27% vote against her re-election. She is the former chief executive of giant investment manager Allianz Global Investors, so this was a case of shareholding fund managers voting against one of their own. She should take the hint and go. Pearson’s commitment to “continuing dialogue with our shareholders” on pay will look thin if the same individual is sent out to bat again.
“We’re the world’s learning company,” says the corporate blurb, but Pearson has shown zero understanding of the public anger over undeserved corporate pay. The lesson isn’t hard: when you’ve reported record losses, don’t give the boss a bonus.
Oil industry hopes that the price of Brent crude would stabilise at around $60 (£46) a barrel were dashed last week.
But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week.
For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.

I have a fondness for softly spoken cheese that is just a short step from milk
Back at home, I left the burrata in a dressing of orange zest and juice, crushed coriander seeds, wine vinegar and a few flakes of dried chilli. Once the cheese had taken up a little of the flavours from the marinade, we ate it alongside a spinach and blood orange salad. One wobbly, barely set cheese and a handful of spinach each. The young leaves, their points as sharp as a spear, appeared again in a hastily put together lunch with shoots of wild garlic, the two greens forming a soft pile into which I tucked pieces of taleggio. Once heated the cheese formed pools that spilled down on to the thick hot toast beneath. I caught it just as the cheese started to liquefy, before it had a chance to colour and become chewy.
These cheeses, along with soft, mousse-like goat’s cheeses, are light enough to fold into the eggy clouds of an omelette or to spread straight on to sweet white brioche and top with early strawberries. There is something fleeting about these cheeses, with flavours that are pure and unchallenging. There is a delicate note that makes them candidates for breaking into small pieces and tossing with young peas, fresh from the pot, in lieu of butter. Or how about folding pieces of taleggio or mozzarella into warm steamed rice, so the cheese softens rather than melts, lightly coating the grains. I rather think basil is then called for or chopped leaves of tarragon.
Taleggio melts particularly easily, but you could use fontina or any soft cheese should you wish. Wild garlic leaves have a short season, so I tend to make the most of them while they are here. I have yet to have any success with planting them in the garden.
Wash the spinach thoroughly and remove the toughest of the stalks. Without shaking the leaves dry, put them into a large saucepan over a moderate heat, covered tightly with a lid.
Grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat just before it turns gold
Let them steam for a minute or two, then turn the spinach over, and continue cooking until the leaves have wilted. Drain and refresh the leaves in iced water. Squeeze the leaves in the palm of your hand to remove as much water as possible, then separate them as best you can. If the leaves are very large, chop them roughly.
Mix together the crème fraîche and mustard in a mixing bowl. Put the spinach in the bowl then fold into the mustard crème fraîche and a little salt and black pepper. Toast the pieces of sourdough until lightly crisp and golden on both sides. Remove the stalks of the garlic leaves and cut them into small dice. Keep the leaves intact. Cook the leaves and chopped stems for a minute or two in the butter, just until the leaves wilt. Remove, drain and stir in the spinach.
Get the oven grill hot. Pile the spinach and garlic mixture on to the toasted bread. Tear the taleggio into large pieces and tuck among the spinach. Grate the parmesan and scatter over the top then grill until the cheese melts but remove from the heat before it turns gold.
Buffalo mozzarella is fine here, too, but use burrata if you can get hold of it, for its texture – which is softer and more fragile.
Make the marinade by grating the zest of the blood orange into a deep container large enough to take the cheeses. Halve the orange and squeeze the juice into the zest. Add the olive oil, the dried chilli flakes and the red wine vinegar. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the coriander seeds and add to the marinade with a coarse grinding of black pepper. Open the cheeses, drain them of their packing liquid then place them in the marinade. Turn them over to coat with the marinade then cover and refrigerate for at least four hours. Turn the cheese over in the marinade every 40 minutes or so.
Make the salad. Peel the oranges taking care to remove all the white pith that lies under the skin. Save as much juice as you can and pour it into a bowl. Pour the marinade from the cheese into the bowl and return the cheeses to the fridge. Trim the asparagus then cut into long thin shavings using a vegetable peeler. Push the asparagus into the marinade. Trim the spinach leaves, toss them in olive oil, a little salt and pepper and divide between two plates.
Slice the blood oranges and place them in the spinach, lift the asparagus from the marinade and pile on to the plates. Place a cheese on each plate and slit it open. Spoon the marinade over the cheese and the salad.

And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (£78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn’t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (£356m).
One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: “Why did you do it?” At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: “I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.”
Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.
He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors’s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.
Why did I do it? I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer
Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?
“There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,” he says.
Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors’s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year’s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (£10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel “sick”.
“I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,” he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.
But it didn’t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. “I didn’t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,” he says. “It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You’re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don’t get to go outside and say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’”
Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn’t really see anyone who wasn’t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn’t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.
And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company’s liking. He did as he was told.
“Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?” he writes. “Should any such line be drawn at all?” I’m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?
“I think it’s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that’s what I wish I had done much earlier,” he says. “But it’s very easy for me to say: ‘Follow your own morals and it will be fine.’ But it won’t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you’ll begin to run into trouble.” He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it’s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.
I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. “I don’t want to say,” he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned “a seven-figure sum”. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.
“You get these bonus cheques, but there’s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I’ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.” At £1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.
But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn’t perform well, and he felt short-changed.
I didn’t think about the system as a whole. You never say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’
“Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It’s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn’t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It’s more like you’ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.”
Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.
I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says – he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. “The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.”
But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He’s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? “I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,” he says, “but I don’t think so.” He says he couldn’t do it without becoming obsessed again.
Does he miss the money? “Of course, it’s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn’t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.”
A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: “Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn’t spend much time thinking about it – at least not until it was too late.”
“That was the only thing that I really liked,” he says now. “Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.”
I think he should stick to lecturing.
Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time – but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.
During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo Häyhä. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when Häyhä was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: “I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.” Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed “snipers”. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees – no matter what their job description is.
I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.
I wouldn’t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I would become
“Don’t worry,” I was told. “We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.” I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee’s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.
Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.

When the engine stops, you get off, Osama told them.
Three uncomfortable days later, they lurched to a halt on the outskirts of Jalalabad, a city in the north-east of Afghanistan, next to a dun-coloured fort surrounded by 4m-high mud walls and crowned with guard towers. The fort was a barracks for the al-Qaida training camp located at a nearby village, and Osama had grandiosely named it Najm al-Jihad, the Star of the Holy War. Surrounded by adobe huts set into a lunar landscape, it was dubbed “Star Wars” by Osama’s third son, Saad. Discarded ammunition boxes, food packaging and empty bottles of chemicals lay everywhere. Khairiah, the family matriarch, organised a clean-up.
The women pinned up woollen rugs as insulation and plumped thin foam mattresses with old clothes, inspecting the bedding for scorpions and snakes. Narrow alleys that connected the apartments to a tin toilet outhouse were swilled out, and in the rudimentary kitchen area someone fixed the water pump and got an old generator running. The women would cook on a traditional Afghan bukhar (open stove); the three nursing mothers were to have the best pickings. Osama’s 14-year-old daughter Khadija had recently given birth. Two years earlier, she had been married in a double wedding with her 12-year-old half-sister Fatima. Their husbands, two Saudi brothers in their 30s who both had wives and children already, were mujahideen fighters. Saad bin Laden’s wife, Wafa, also had a baby, as did Osama’s youngest wife, Amal.
The children fought over a battered Nintendo or scanned their father’s transistor for snatches of Madonna
Without any adult male relatives to protect them, only al-Qaida guards who could not enter the same room, the wives had been instructed by Osama to blow themselves up if the situation became critical. Even nine-year-old Ladin had a role. He was to lie on his back, staring up into the sky, scouting for enemy jets, as war with America now appeared inevitable.
At night they huddled under a blanket with a Kalashnikov and a stash of grenades, wondering what would befall those friends and family left behind in the cities, and when they would next see their husband and sons.
***
But lately there had been dissonance. Many al-Qaida members had witnessed the screaming rows Osama had with Omar, the teenage son he had been training as his heir, who bore a striking resemblance to his father. Omar had never shared his father’s obsession with war, and after he learned of his father’s coming Planes Operation, he became determined to leave. He had gone to his mother, Najwa, pleading with her to come with him. But she had never disobeyed her husband, so Omar had slipped away alone. “[My father’s] violent path had separated us for ever,” he later recalled.
But by the end of August 2001, Najwa had a change of heart. With Omar’s words playing on her mind, she asked to return to her parents in Syria – an unexpected act of rebellion from a woman who had stuck by her husband’s side for 26 years and given him 11 children.
Najwa had never intended to be a jihadi bride. Glamorous and beautiful, she was a Ghanem, from an old, cultured Syrian family, and had grown up in the cosmopolitan seaside resort of Latakia, where women wore bikinis. She had married Osama in 1974, when she had just turned 16 and he was still forging a reputation as a demon soccer player at his university, and for driving fast cars recklessly. She had been charmed by this doe-eyed boy, the 17th son of one of Saudi Arabia’s richest men, and also her cousin. Arriving as Osama’s young wife in Jeddah, she had reluctantly donned a chador and niqab, but underneath the black folds still wore lipstick and designer clothes.
Over the years, Osama’s demands had worn her down. His brothers’ wives remember her as downcast, drab and permanently pregnant. “[She] seemed almost completely invisible,” says Carmen bin Laden, the former wife of Osama’s half-brother Yeslam.
Najwa had sought help for her sons at a clinic in Jeddah, where she met Khairiah, a child psychologist, seven years older than Osama. Osama wanted to have as many children as possible “for Islam” and Najwa suggested Khairiah could help him achieve that, as well as assist with their sons’ education. Osama judged that she was perfect: the Prophet had decreed that men should wed “unmarriageable” women to enable them to share the joy of motherhood.
Khairiah eventually bore Osama a son, Hamzah, who went on to inherit his father’s religious fervour, while she forged a role as the extended family’s matriarch. It was in her room in Kandahar that everyone gathered to resolve disputes and discuss impending changes, or to lobby for an extra sack of rice, basic medicine or schoolbooks.
Unlike Najwa, Khairiah was devout, and had married Osama in 1985, when he was already well on the path to jihad. Osama’s fourth wife, Seham, was also deeply religious, claiming descent from the Prophet and holding a PhD from Medina University. She had worked as a teacher before she married Osama, in 1987, at which point she too set herself the task of having as many children as she could. Before 9/11, Seham’s hut in Kandahar had been the family classroom, complete with slates, chalk and secondhand exam papers purchased in the bazaar. The children remember how Osama would occasionally interrupt, conducting impromptu maths and English tests, with his children lined up in order of size.
Osama expected all his children to play their part in jihad. Rather than celebrating birthdays, the boys were videotaped brandishing weapons or visiting the scenes of battle. Daughters were married at the onset of puberty to mujahideen fighters twice their age, to expand al-Qaida’s sphere of influence.
Only Najwa fought to soften the children’s world and they were drawn to her, eager for the treats she procured, especially her radio on which they remember listening to American pop, and eating her improvised spaghetti bolognese – tomato puree mixed with a packet of Maggi noodles.
So it was Osama’s decision to marry a Yemeni teenager, 18-year-old Amal al-Sadeh, in June 2000, that transformed an unconventional family into a dysfunctional one. Shortly before 9/11, Amal gave birth to a daughter and Najwa walked out, taking her youngest children and one adult son whose disabilities made him dependent on her. As they drove away, headed for Syria, Najwa turned to see the rest of her family enveloped in the dust.
“My mother’s heart broke into little pieces watching the silhouettes of my little children fade into the distance,” she said later. Khairiah and Seham stayed, but froze out Amal.
Then came 9/11, trumping every other concern.
Osama departed, giving each of his sons a string of prayer beads and urging them to “stay strong and true to Islam”. He left behind suitcases containing clothes and gold coins. Dressed in tribal robes, his family would travel through the night and attempt to cross into Pakistan at a remote checkpoint, using documents provided by the Sudanese authorities during the time they lived there in the 90s. Their old Saudi passports were sealed in brown envelopes and hidden away.
***
Mahfouz debated with his colleagues for days what to do with Osama’s family. CIA agents were closing in everywhere. US helicopters flew along the Pakistan border. He needed to escort his charges to somewhere that was completely off limits to America. They were among the world’s most wanted, and relatively easy to spot: tall, fine-boned Arabs, several of whom closely resembled Osama, and who spoke no local languages.
In the end, they reached an unlikely conclusion: send the wives and children of Osama bin Laden, leader of an outlawed Sunni militia, to seek asylum in Iran, the centre of Shia power.
Among the al-Qaida families to arrive were Khairiah and a group of Osama’s children; Seham and her children had elected to stay behind in Pakistan. In Iran, they were guided by Saif al-Adel, al-Qaida’s military commander, to a remote farm east of Zabol.
The advice was of no comfort to Hamzah, who still carried the string of prayer beads his father had given him in the olive groves of Melawa, a moment so painful that he later wrote about it in a letter, saying he “remembered every smile that my father smiled at me, every word that he spoke to me and every look that he gave me.”
When Saif made it clear to the family that he was directly in touch with Osama, Hamzah wrote him a letter, later released by al-Qaida. Born into jihad, Hamzah had never known peace. Now that he was in Iran, he could see no future. “Tell me, Father, something useful about what I see,” he pleaded in 2002. “What has happened to us?”
A few weeks later, Osama, though in hiding and on the run, replied: “Suffice it to say that I am full of grief and sighs. Pardon me, my son, but I can only see a very steep path ahead.” He had a message for all the family: even though they had reached Iran, they were still not safe. “Security has gone, but danger remains.”
By 2007, Osama’s family in Iran had expanded, with the birth of several grandchildren, and they had been relocated to another building in the complex, this one called Block 300. Tensions with their hosts, terrible food and unsanitary conditions had taken their toll. Saad, 28, was by now the father of three children, a boy named Osama and two little girls. A few months earlier his wife, Wafa, had had another son who died because the Iranians had refused a hospital visit. Another shura member’s wife had also died for want of medical treatment; Khairiah suffered excruciating dental problems and walked with a cane.
Osama’s grandsons pelted guards with stones, shouting, 'We have been illegally kidnapped and hidden in this secret jail'
A temporary rapprochement was reached during Ramadan in October 2007, when the Iranians took al-Qaida out for an iftar (breaking the fast) meal at a five-star restaurant in downtown Tehran. Osama’s sons reciprocated by inviting the officials to dine with them in the compound. The following Friday, a car arrived at Block 300 to pick them up, before speeding toward Tehran University. Osama’s sons were greeted by officials who led them through the security gates and around the back of a covered prayer hall into a small waiting area carpeted with prayer mats.
***
Abu Ghaith’s mania eventually caused the Iranians to snap. But when the guards tried to manhandle him, a full-blown prison riot exploded. Egyptian and Libyan al-Qaida brothers ripped up sheets and shattered wooden beds, setting fires, hurling petrol bombs made with secretly stockpiled heating fuel and daubing anti-Shia messages on the walls. Mahfouz remembers watching as Osama’s grandsons pelted guards with stones. “We have been illegally kidnapped and concealed in this secret jail,” they shouted, thumping the wall. “Our ongoing incarceration goes against international law.” They would rather be prosecuted than remain in this “living cemetery”, they said.
Hamzah vowed to sign up for the jihad. His mother, Khairiah, declared she would return to her husband’s side. Meanwhile, Osama’s 17-year-old daughter Iman wished to go to her mother, Najwa, in Syria. However, first someone had to escape to raise the alarm. Everyone hesitated. Despite the tough talking, they had all become fearful of the outside world.
Soon after, Fatima learned that Khadija, her favourite sister, had died in Waziristan giving birth to twins. One baby was also dead; the other, a girl, was critically ill. Fatima was devastated. Deep depression settled over the family compound.
In May 2008, Iranian officials arrived on a detente mission, carrying boxes of sweets and cakes. Saad bin Laden spotted that the gate had been left open and, speaking fast in Arabic, he ordered his nephews and nieces to make a run for it. They hurtled out toward the entrance, surprising the Quds force guards, who stood down, not wanting to fire on children. Soon they were joined by their mothers, who sat down by the main gate, through which they could see members of the public strolling by.
“We want freedom, we want human rights,” Mahfouz remembers the women chanting, remaining immovable for the next 36 hours. Confronted with a top-secret cache of al-Qaida hostages crying out for help, Major General Suleimani sent in ice-creams for the children and a lavish meal for the adults, served out on the gravel. But no one budged. Exasperated, the Iranians eventually sent soldiers dressed in black overalls and ski masks to beat the families back into Block 300.
Days later, Osama’s family was given 24 hours’ notice to pack. Since the Iranians could no longer control their al-Qaida guests, the family was moving. They were driven into the country’s central desert, to the historic city of Yazd. Their new home was a sand-coloured villa surrounded by a low mud-brick wall.
The Iranian escorts took rooms closest to the main gate. There would be no trips out, they said. Such privileges had been lost. But as the family members wandered around, one thing struck them: there were no security cameras at the rear. Hamzah volunteered to hop over the back wall. Khairiah vetoed it. At 19, he was too young. Besides, his wife, Asma, had just given birth to a daughter. Saad, the eldest son present, said he would do it. His siblings shook their heads in disbelief – he would never survive. But that night, Saad slipped over the wall into the desert night. He was determined to find his father in Pakistan and then rescue them all.
After Saad’s escape was discovered, Osama’s family were transported back to Tehran, where they found a new kind of prison waiting for them at the heart of the Quds force complex. It consisted of purpose-built apartments for each family, a school, mosque, football pitch, even a swimming pool. As a joke, they referred to it as the “Tourist Complex”. But with tall walls and motion censors, it was a more modern prison and from their rooms they could hear Quds force recruits training.
At the end of the first month, some of Osama’s sons were offered their first phone calls. Whisked to the Afghan border and given a Thuraya satellite phone – a location and device that were intended to confuse American eavesdroppers – they were ordered to say nothing about their precise location. They reached Omar bin Laden, Osama’s son who had left Afghanistan before 9/11 and was now living in Qatar with his British wife Zaina. Over the years, Omar and his mother, Najwa, had written to the International Red Cross and the United Nations in search of their family. Now, stunned, they got a call from the desert. Omar promised to help.
The phone party returned to Tehran, their spirits buoyed. But then came news from Pakistan. Saad bin Laden was dead – killed in a drone strike in Waziristan. That night, Osama’s grieving sons gathered. They had convinced each other that Saad had been reunited with their father, and now they felt hopeless.
***
On 21 November 2009, Mahfouz was deep into his late night Qur’anic reading when he heard a knock at the door. He opened it to find Iman, Osama’s daughter, now 18, requesting to see his daughter Khadija, her best friend. When they were alone, Iman took off a gold ring and handed it to her. “This was a gift from my father but now it’s yours,” Iman said, explaining that something was about to happen that would “hit the compound like an earthquake”.
Slipping off her niqab, Iman swaddled a doll as if it were a baby, and made her escape
While Khairiah and Fatima bin Laden filled their trolleys, with excited young children trailing behind, demanding sweets, Iman pulled Khadija into the toy section. Weren’t they too old for this, Khadija asked? Iman grabbed a lifesize baby doll and took out some clothes she had snatched off a shelf elsewhere in the store. Khadija watched, stunned, as her friend changed into them, slipping off her black abaya and niqab, and transforming herself with an Iranian chemise, a pair of jeans and a colourful headscarf wrapped around her hair in the Iranian style. Then she swaddled the doll in a blanket as if it were a real baby, embraced her friend and set off. “What are you doing?” Khadija hissed. “What does it look like?” Iman called back, before vanishing into the crowd.
It took a few minutes for their Iranian escorts to realise she was missing, and then intelligence agents swarmed into the square. But Iman was too quick for them and had asked the first woman she saw with a phone if she could borrow it. She rang her oldest brother, Abdullah bin Laden, a Jeddah businessman who had rejected his father’s lifestyle back in 1995. Unable to believe he was talking to someone he had thought was long dead, he instructed Iman to run to the Saudi embassy. He would call ahead.
Back in the Tourist Complex, the family sat in silence, too frightened to be hopeful. For three days there was no news. Then, as Mahfouz and his family watched a local cable channel, a ticker tape ran across the bottom of the screen. Normally, it carried service updates or ads for local kebab shops. But this one was different. “Iman is fine,” it read. “She has come.”
Iman bin Laden was reunited with her mother Najwa in Syria in early 2010, after spending more than 100 days inside the Saudi embassy in Tehran. She now lives in Jeddah with several siblings, including Fatima; her mother often travels to Qatar where many other family members live, including Omar and Ladin.
After a year in Pakistani detention, Khairiah, Seham and Amal, who had all witnessed the killing of their husband, were deported, along with 11 children and grandchildren, to Saudi Arabia. Today they live in a compound outside Jeddah.
Mahfouz, who watched the news reports on Osama’s death from the Tourist Complex, finally escaped Iran in 2012 and returned to Mauritania.

Mrs May is not the most awesome political genius to walk the earth. Far from it. She has little in the way of solid achievement to show for her nine months at Number 10 and has spent her election campaign swaddled in opacity about what she would do with a five-year term. Mrs May only gets to look unbeatable because of the paucity of the competition provided by a Labour leadership that combines unelectable hard leftism with utter ineptness.
It was not “inevitable” that we would have this “Brexit election” at all. This is happening because of the narrow victory for Out in the referendum last year. Only a small amount of mental energy is required to envisage an alternative history that would have produced a different result. A Labour party under more credible leadership that had demonstrated some enthusiasm for the Remain cause could very well have tipped the result the other way when the country made its choice about Europe.
As Labour stares into the jaws of disaster, it is essential to grasp that there was nothing pre-ordained about this rout. The electoral evisceration of Labour wasn’t written in the stars. Defeat is not to be blamed on the whims of the gods or the tides of the moon. This calamity can’t be put down to the caprice of fate. The Tories were handed this opportunity to smash their way to a big majority because Labour made terrible choices and is under abysmal leadership.
A thumping Tory triumph now looks unstoppable. It was never inevitable.

The boy had made the original call, police said in a statement.
According to the statement, two officers responded to a 911 call requesting a welfare check on a 15-year-old standing in front of a school. The caller said the boy was not armed.
A boy at the school pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at one of the responding officers as they exited their patrol cars, the statement said.
The officers drew weapons and instructed the boy to drop the gun, the statement said, but he refused and walked toward an officer, ignoring a second command to drop the gun and continuing to walk toward one of them.
Both officers fired, striking the boy several times. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.
The gun held by the teen turned out to be a semi-automatic BB air pistol, police said.
The boy, who was not identified because of his age, was a local resident who was a student at the school where he was shot, police said.

International support for landmine clearance has fallen below $400m for the first time in a decade
The effects of war are felt in the devastation of services; the destruction of economies; the fragmentation of families and communities; long-term injuries and illnesses; and, of course, the absence of loved ones. But you cannot restore water supplies or reopen schools or plant crops if you cannot cross the land safely. You cannot recover psychologically while living in constant fear of setting foot in the wrong place. The converse of that depressing truth is that investing in munitions destruction and clearance pays dividends. It is the first step to solving many more problems.

“The prime minister warmly congratulates president-elect Macron on his election success,” the statement said. “France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities.”
While Marine Le Pen was projected to take about 11m votes, double her father’s score in 2002, it was clearly satisfying to many leaders that the far right appeared unable to get above the 40% mark, which some feared would be breached.
“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité! France chose that today. The great nation was, is, and remains in the middle and at the heart of Europe,” wrote Gabriel on Twitter, using France’s national slogan.
Not only did the result come as a significant relief for the European commission, but it will be seen by some in Brussels as a vindication of the EU executive’s unprecedented backing for a candidate in a domestic election. The decision to not comment during the Brexit referendum in the UK, and the question of whether that had been the right way forward, had weighed heavily on officials’ minds in Brussels.
Responding to Sunday’s result, Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party, the largest group in the European parliament, of which Merkel and Juncker are members, expressed the relief felt by many at the result and its wider ramifications. “The election shows that people are ready to fight against extremism and populism,” he said. “For all those who think that France can only be strong in a strong Europe and that Europe needs France to be self-confident and sure of its assets, this result is an immense relief.”
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, and now the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “Congratulations to President @EmmanuelMacron! Everyone is looking to #France now to take the lead in a New Deal for Europe.”
Macron is said to be planning to promote democratic conventions in every member state in order to gauge the type of EU citizens are seeking.
He also made public his desire for the 73 seats currently held by UK MEPs to be transferred to a trans-national European list in a symbolic show of support for further pan-European cooperation.
Indeed while Downing Street welcomed the result, the British government may reasonably harbour some concerns about what the result will mean for the Brexit negotiations.

But Berisha’s brilliance – and James Troisi’s extra-time volley that struck a post – could not prevent Sydney’s third A-League title, secured in a mostly jubilant, but uniformly breathless, arena that had witnessed fireworks – both metaphorical and literal – from start to finish. It also went some way to eliminate painful memories of the last time these two sides met in a grand final, two years ago in Melbourne, although Graham Arnold would rather have won in different circumstances.
“I’ve been through that [a grand final penalty shootout] before,” the Sydney coach said. “It’s not the greatest way to win or lose. But that’s the way it is. I thought it was a real cup final. It was a very physical game, a lot of free-kicks, a lot of fouls, a lot of passion.”
Indeed, it was far from a classic encounter between these two old rivals but what it lacked in class and guile was made up for in brawn and, by the end of the night, pure drama. From the first whistle, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque set the tone, leaving a high foot in on eventual Joe Marston medal recipient Daniel Georgievski’s thigh and what ensued during a niggly, and at times spiteful, game should have come as no surprise.
Referee Jarred Gillett had his work cut out – nearly every decision he made was vociferously contested by one side or the other, and the opening period ended with five names in his notebook. He had accrued a total of 11 by the time the shootout arrived. Meanwhile, Graham Arnold and Kevin Muscat spent much of their time stalking the touchline and berating the fourth official.
The flow of the game suffered from the regular stoppages, playacting and constant recriminations – and arguably the state of the pitch, which had been used for a Super Rugby fixture the previous night despite a last-ditch attempt to shift that fixture elsewhere. With both team’s more creative players stifled, the likes of Ninković and Rojas were unable to stamp their authority in the way they might have been expected.
With supply lines cut, scoring opportunities were few and far between. Fahid Ben Khalfallah found Rojas at the back post with pinpoint accuracy after 11 minutes, but the New Zealand international’s pull back across the face of goal was turned over the bar by a Sydney defender.
Ninković was able, fleetingly, to give a glimpse of what he is capable of when he delivered a teasing ball across the face of goal on 16 minutes, the kind that must have been in mind when the term “corridor of uncertainty” was invented. Victory survived, but it led to a brief period when Sydney began to flex their muscles for the first time.
Berisha soon put paid to that with his individual moment of brilliance. The Kosovo international took on the Sydney defence with the kind of single-minded intent that has become his trademark. The way he scythed through Sydney’s backline showed scant regard for a defence that had, to that point, conceded just 12 goals all season. He has now scored in each of the four grand finals he has appeared in.
The initial spate of bookings came soon after the deadlock had been broken and it took just over 20 minutes for Khalfallah and James Troisi to been shown yellow, along with Sydney’s Josh Brillante, Ninković and Filip Hološko. Three of those names were taken following an ugly 20-man coming together in the centre circle as tempers boiled over in a moment that typified the first half.
Any hopes that cooler heads would emerge after the break soon evaporated as Victory skipper Carl Valeri levelled the booking ledger by becoming Victory’s third man into the book, for a crude challenge that might have warranted a straight red on another day.
Football was, however, occasionally allowed to shine through amid the pervading fug. Most of it came from Sydney in the second half and it was the home side who fashioned the better chances – first Hološko ballooned over from close range when he should really have done better, and then David Carney, on for Hološko, saw an effort saved by Thomas.
Carney, who won the title 11 years ago during his first stint with Sydney, was to play a key role moments later. It was his curling shot that Lawrence Thomas tipped onto the inside of the post, leaving a desperate, prone Berisha to head feebly into the path of the onrushing Grant. The right-back tapped gleefully home.
The goal further invigorated Sydney, yet try as they might and amid much huffing and puffing they were unable to blow down Victory’s door again in regulation time. Indeed, they could have been caught on the break, as Rojas and Troisi combined well, but the latter lacked a finishing touch.
“The first half was difficult,” Arnold said. “The first half we didn’t play our way, we ended up playing a game of kick and rush and fighting for the second ball. And when you have the quality of players like Ninković and Brosque that’s not their type of game.
“I said at half-time I’d rather lose than not play our way, the way we’ve played all season, the way we’ve created history with a lot of things. I wanted us to play our way and we did.”
To extra-time and Victory pulses again quickened, momentarily, when a high ball was launched into the box before it skewed away from a posse of players and brushed the outside of the post; the flag was up, regardless.
After the changeover, and with tired limbs in evidence all over the pitch, Troisi dug deep and mustered what so nearly could have been the defining moment of the game – a truly brilliant volley that arguably deserved to be the winner, but he saw it cannon back off Vukovic’s upright.
At the other end, Carney had a chance to settle it with five minutes remaining but he sliced his shot horribly to leave the expectant home crowd frustrated – and preparing to accept that their entire season, which had been so dominant, would not only come down to a winner-takes-all match, but rather one decisive penalty shootout. This time for Sydney, they will feel justice was served.

Fernando Gaviria claimed his first Grand Tour stage victory as what looked like being the most straightforward day of the 100th Giro d’Italia blew apart in howling winds in Sardinia.
Gaviria took the stage win and the race leader’s pink jersey after the Colombian’s QuickStep-Floors team led the decisive break when echelons split through the peloton on the final approach to Cagliari.
A bunch sprint had been expected at the end of the short, flat 148km stage from Tortoli, but the peloton was buffeted by winds reaching 40km per hour in the final 30km. As the road changed direction several times, the winds turned from crosswinds to headwinds again and again, splitting the pack apart and meaning only four riders crossed the line on the same time as Gaviria.
Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas fought gamely to join the QuickStep-led escape before dropping back, but he finished with the main contenders to sit 11th overall, 23 seconds down on Gaviria.

Unearthing an original That’s All Right record became a £4,000 lucky strike; a set of five original Sun singles at one time fetched £25,000. This made them a sort of pension for many collectors. They packed items away, hoping one day to exchange them for a caravan in the Dordogne. However, this has all begun to change.
There are about 32,000 Elvis records being sold on eBay at the moment – this number was closer to 20,000 items for all memorabilia five years ago. And it’s not even as if they are selling well. Of the 40,000 vinyl listings to finish in the past three months, only 16,000 have resulted in a sale. The problem is, there simply aren’t enough collectors left. “You’ll barely see Elvis guys here, not any more,” I’m told by Alan Simpson, an Elvis dealer at Stratford-upon-Avon record fair, as he stands over a vacant stall.

But his victory is more a cause for relief than celebration. The new president has been audacious in his centrist campaign based on a new movement, En Marche!. He has also been incredibly lucky in his rivals. Until this second round, he spoke for a quarter of his compatriots at best. At various stages, François Hollande, Manuel Valls, Nicolas Sarkozy, Alain Juppé, François Bayrou, Benoît Hamon, François Fillon, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Ms Le Pen all threatened. Yet, one by one, the contenders knocked themselves out. He has a huge task of consolidation, particularly given that more than a third of French voters supported a far-right, anti-European, anti-immigrant and racist party leader, right up to the end. There is nothing to salute there.

In a defiant speech, the far-right leader declared the Front National was now France’s main opposition movement. She urged the party to renew itself “to rise to the historic opportunity and meet the French people’s expectations. I will propose to start this deep transformation of our movement in order to make a new political force”.
What Le Pen’s promised transformation meant was not immediately clear, but that did not matter to the crowd, who cheered “Merci Marine” as she left the stage.
The Le Pen team chose a smart brasserie, which was a former hunting lodge for Napoleon III, for their party. Located in the Vincennes wood in eastern Paris, the bucolic scene is far from the grandeur of the Place de l’Opéra in central Paris where her father made fiery speeches every year on May Day.
It was a party to showcase the modern Front National, rebranded by Marine, away from Jean-Marie Le Pen’s more obvious hardline, antisemitic rhetoric. Well-heeled professionals wore discreet blue rose pins, while tables were decorated with fake blue roses. Only a few people sported the older FN flame pin.
Florian Philippot, a senior FN figure, suggested to French media that the party would soon be renamed.
Libération reported that more than half a dozen media outlets were denied entry to the FN party on the grounds of lack of space, including the investigative site Mediapart, Charlie Hebdo and Buzzfeed. But, despite the party’s claim there were not enough places, the press room was never more than half full.
There was no repeat protest on election night. Security was tight: the sprawling park was locked down for the evening, with a dozen police vans guarding the entrance.
Some FN figures have been less complimentary in private, including some sniping about her performance in a head-to-head TV debate with Macron.
“Marine did not convince the undecided,” one anonymous Front National MEP told Le Monde. Another party insider was blunter, describing her performance as a “catastrophe” that “was not worthy of a presidential debate, adding “Macron gave the impression that he had a project … Marine apart from the basics, was frankly not on top form”.
But that mood was far away on Sunday night. Dominic Leliliet, a 57-year old small businessman, said he was celebrating “the victory of the ideas”. He added: “Macron must take these into account, [the ideas of] the patriots”.

Within minutes of arriving to collect my professionally bound thesis, I found myself on the receiving end of an unsolicited and impenetrable rant about female genital mutilation.
“What’s your paper on?” the shop owner inquired.
“It’s on Muslim women and … ,” I began, but before I could finish my sentence, he had launched into the subject.
The fact that I hadn’t even mentioned the words “female genital mutilation” was irrelevant; merely saying “Muslim women” was a wide enough rabbit hole for him to dart down. My presence as a Muslim woman and my half-delivered topic were the only encouragement he needed.
It’s uncanny how often people try to demonstrate their concern about the alleged oppression of Muslim women by humiliating them. Even finding out the details of my research findings doesn’t seem to deter them from baldly sharing opinions.
I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about 'Islam’s treatment of women' countless times
When I was neck-deep in my doctoral research, I attended a black-tie journalism-industry dinner on a windy Sydney night. Some of Australia’s most intelligent and perceptive thinkers were in the well-dressed crowd. I had grown accustomed to answering questions about my subject. I had also grown quite used to the standard responses I received to my thesis, and habitually gave ambiguous answers to avoid them.
A well-known and popular journalist approached me and asked what I did for living. His reaction, despite belonging to a group of people usually known for their cognitive skills, was so representative that I scribbled it down on a dinner napkin as soon as he left so I would not forget a word:
Journalist: So what do you do?
Me: I’m completing my PhD.
Journalist: On?
Me: (purposefully vague) Sociology and politics.
Journalist: But what is your exact research question?
Me: (inward sigh at what was inevitably to follow, but valiantly indifferent exterior) I’m investigating the way Muslim women fight sexism within Muslim communities.
Journalist: (with widened, alarmed eyes) That’s dangerous waters!
Me: (through gritted teeth) Not really. It’s been going on for many hundreds of years, and I’ve been spoiled for choice with the number of women who have been willing to be participants in my research.
Journalist: Did they want it known what they were doing? Or did they need it kept secret?
Me: (icy frustration descends into Arctic winter) Oh, many of them were happy to be identified in my research. In fact, some were angry when I suggested giving them a pseudonym, insisting they wanted to be known for this work.
Journalist: (now completely flabbergasted) But … but, did their husbands know of their apostasy?!
Me: (choosing to ignore use of “apostasy” as eyes take on glacial sheen) Actually, many of the women listed their husbands, or another Muslim man – like their father or imam – as their greatest supporters.
Journalist: (now quite literally speechless) …
I’ve had similar exchanges — too many to count — with non-Muslims over the course of my research. Commonplace is the firm conviction that sexism against Muslim women is rife, most often coupled with the utter disbelief that women who challenge sexism could exist, let alone that there are many of them, that they are not a new phenomenon, and that Muslim men often support them in their efforts. I often wonder how people can be so comfortable presenting these attitudes directly to me, a clearly identifiable Muslim woman in a hijab. They do not appear at all uneasy in making it apparent just how bad they think life is for any and all Muslim women, and how unengaged they believe Muslim women to be in confronting the sexism they invariably face.
I have received similar, but different, reactions within some sections of various Muslim communities when they found out the focus of my research. Often I would be purposefully vague when discussing my topic with them, too. I would restrict myself to saying that I was researching “Muslim women”, and avoid highlighting the “fighting sexism” part, as there is a complicated, often suspicious attitude towards anything that may be perceived as “feminism” within Muslim communities. Or I would rush to reassure them that I was not framing this in an anti-religious perspective.
Their scepticism is perhaps an understandable reaction from a minority community that frequently feels under siege, particularly when it comes to women’s rights. I hoped the fact that my research was being carried out from within a common faith, and that it drew explicitly and deeply on the theological resources afforded by this, reassured them that I, unlike many others, was not engaging in an attack on the faith and communities they held dear.
But still certain people within the Muslim community were scornful, rolling their eyes and calling me a feminist — not as a compliment, but a warning. They saw feminism and Islam as inherently at odds.
This is the terrain in which my research into Muslim women occurred. The subject is fraught on multiple fronts; the topic of “Muslim women and sexism” is a minefield of unflappable certainty and indignation from all corners. Yet for something about which so many people are adamantly sure, I feel there is very little information from the women actually involved. It seems to me that, in the argument in which Muslim women are the battlefield, the war rages on and the angry accusations zing past their heads from all sides. The main casualty is, ironically, women’s self-determination.
Islam is arguably the most discussed religion in the west today, in both media and society, and, after terrorism, the plight of Muslim women is probably the most controversial topic of debate. I have been asked, challenged, harangued and abused about “Islam’s treatment of women” countless times in person and online. Nonetheless, there is only a small amount of published work available on the topic of Muslim women fighting sexism within Muslim communities, and much of that focuses on women who see Islam as inherently part of the problem — if not the whole problem — that Muslim women face.
The assumption is that Muslim women need to be extricated from the religion entirely before anything close to liberation or equality can be achieved.
There are limited sociological accounts of Muslim women who fight sexism from a faith-positive perspective, and only a handful of studies that investigate the theological works of some Muslim feminists. The responses to, and motivations of, these women are dealt with coincidentally, as opposed to primarily. This small pool of available resources clashes with what I know anecdotally to be happening in many Muslim communities, as well as the historical accounts of Muslim women who, from the earliest days of Islam, have been challenging the sexism they have experienced by using religious arguments.
For years now I have been speaking about issues relating to Islam, Muslims and gender to the media, both Australian and overseas. In one sense I choose this, but in another it has been chosen for me, moulded by the way others attempt to define and restrict me, more or less obliging me to respond.
It’s a common story. Jasmin Zine, a Canadian scholar, once observed that not just our actions but also our very identities are constantly being shaped by dual, competing discourses that surround us. There’s the fundamentalist, patriarchal narrative, persistently trying to confine the social and public lives of Muslim women in line with the kind of narrow, gendered parameters that are by now so familiar. But there are also some western feminist discourses that seek to define our identities in ways that are quite neocolonial: backward, oppressed, with no hope of liberation other than to emulate whatever western notions of womanhood are on offer. This wedging chimes with my experience, and it’s a problem because, as Zine argues, both arms deny Muslim women the ability — indeed the right — to define our identities for ourselves, and especially to do so within the vast possibilities of Islam.
It is as though male Muslim scholars and non-Muslim western feminists have handed down predetermined scripts for us to live by. And it is left to those people thought not to exist — Muslim women who fight sexism — to rewrite those scenarios and reclaim our identities.

Hacked campaign documents, internal emails and financial data were posted online anonymously along with papers Macron’s team said were false, just before midnight on Friday, the official end-of-electioneering deadline.
The leak cast a long shadow over the legal “election pause” during which Macron and his far-right rival Marine Le Pen are banned from making any statement until polls close at 8pm French time on Sunday. France’s electoral commission warned that publication or republication of the documents could be a criminal offence. The commission urged media and citizens “not to relay” the leaked documents “in order not to alter the sincerity of the vote”.
Just before the deadline, Macron’s En Marche! team said fake documents were mixed in with papers showing legitimate campaign activities in order to “spread doubt and disinformation”.
“This is not just a simple hacking operation but a real attempt to upset the French presidential election,” it said.
At such a late stage, the hack seems unlikely to influence the outcome of today’s election. With the final Ipsos poll showing victory for Macron with 63% of votes and Le Pen 37%, the En Marche! candidate will be hoping to put a scrappy election behind him and look forward to an in-tray which looks intimidating to say the least.
Macron, who has never held an elected post, has promised change, a new moral dawn in political life, and a bright new future. He will have to deliver quickly with, to date, no formal political party. His movement, En Marche!, has never fielded a single candidate in any election, local or national.
Macron, already accused of being Hollande II, will want to avoid that, but needs to move fast between now and the June legislative elections if he is to secure a majority of seats in the national assembly. If he cannot achieve that, there is a danger that France will be politically paralysed, making the two-round general election at least as important as the presidential vote.
Pascal Perrineau, head of the Science-Po university’s political research institute, said that, while the electorate’s reflex after a presidential vote was to give the new leader a parliamentary majority, Macron would find it a challenge to rustle one up.
“Macron has no MPs. If he wins, he will have to organise a parliamentary majority from scratch in a few weeks,” Perrineau said. “So, you are elected, but the question is, who will you work with? If you have no parliamentary majority, you cannot govern; it’s a dead election. Both Macron and Le Pen are amateurs who don’t understand the logic of parliamentary life. Alone, he is nothing. Politics is an entire career, people are not going to rally to him just because he has an extraordinary smile, young blood and blue eyes. There will have to be some serious negotiations.”
Under France’s constitution, the president is supreme political leader and can choose a prime minister, who then recommends government ministers, all of them normally from the president’s party. If Macron obtains an outright majority from a standing point of zero seats, he will be able to enact policies which are Europe-friendly and economically liberal. If he faces a hostile majority in the lower house of parliament and is forced to appoint a prime minister outside his party, he will face a period of what is known as “cohabitation”, meaning he can do little in the face of constant opposition. A third possibility is that En Marche! could have the biggest group of MPs but not a majority, leaving a Macron government with only limited room to manoeuvre but not entirely stymied.
In January, Macron announced En Marche! would field candidates in all 577 parliamentary constituencies. He wants half to come from civil society or elected local authorities. All must have a clean criminal record, renounce current political affiliations and campaign as an En Marche! candidate. At least half must be women.
Andrew Knapp, emeritus professor in European studies at the University of Reading, believes that Macron probably faces a “protracted war of manoeuvre to get legislation through, typically picking different majorities for different issues”.
According to an OpinionWay-SLPV analytics survey, Macron could gain between 249 and 286 seats, the centre- right 200 to 210, and the Front National 15 to 25. On the left, the Socialists would score the worst result in their history with between 28 and 43 seats and Mélenchon would get only six to eight, it predicts. Political experts, however, have described the poll as highly speculative, given that it is based on intentions to vote and En Marche! has only 14 declared candidates so far.
Aware that many are not voting for him but against Le Pen, a triumphant Macron will want to avoid squandering his popularity with silly mistakes or any triumphalism. After the first-round vote he dined at a chic restaurant and announced he would find a role for his wife Brigitte, both of which sparked criticism.
The success of an eventual President Macron will also depend on how many angry and disappointed FN and hard-left Mélenchon supporters take to the streets. And what he does when they do.
Sylvie Goulard, 52
From the centrist MoDem party whose leader François Bayrou was one of the first political heavyweights to rally to Emmanuel Macron, the Marseille-born Goulard is vehemently pro-Europe, a supporter of greater federalism and a graduate, like Macron, of the elite École Nationale d’Administration. Fluent German speaker. Was part of a team negotiating the reunification of Germany in the 1990s and arranged for Macron to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.
Anne-Marie Idrac, 65
Transport secretary in the 1990s, then president of the state-owned transport companies RATP (Paris region) and SNCF (railways). Also a graduate of ENA. Belongs to the Nouveau Centre party.
François Bayrou, 65
Veteran centrist and leader of MoDem, whose early support for Macron boosted the election campaign. A former history teacher, Bayrou was a candidate in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 presidential elections.

What a difference a week makes. Xhaka felt the same injury here and he was removed from the fray in the 76th minute. This time Arsenal were 2-0 up and coasting towards victory in a game they had to win.
Xhaka departed to a rousing ovation. He had made the difference, turning the afternoon in his team’s favour with a deflected pot-shot, and no one could say the break was not overdue for Xhaka, who has endured a difficult first season in England after his big-money move from Borussia Mönchengladbach, or his club.
Arsenal were up and running, their early nerves a distant memory, and when the former United striker Danny Welbeck rose to head home Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain’s cross, after Anthony Martial had been robbed by Rob Holding, the die was cast. United had offered little in an attacking sense and, when they were asked to respond, it was no surprise they could not.
At the 16th time of asking Arsène Wenger could celebrate victory in a competitive match against a José Mourinho team. Arsenal will need a favour from elsewhere if they are to finish a difficult season in a Champions League position but at least they are still fighting.
As for United, this was the limpest of defeats and Mourinho’s post-match press conference, when he wrote off his team’s top-four chances and had a pop at Wenger for pressuring the fourth official, was much more entertaining than what his players served up on the pitch.
Yes, they had two clear first-half chances, which Martial and Wayne Rooney could not take; Rooney’s opportunity was presented to him by an errant Holding back-pass rather than any creativity on United’s part. Petr Cech stood tall on both occasions. But Mourinho’s post‑match performance should not be allowed to obscure his team’s failings.
Opportunity had knocked loudly for them after Liverpool’s home draw against Southampton earlier in the day. Once again United had control of their destiny in terms of the fight for a Champions League finish via the league. They surrendered it and a single statistic continues to damn them. They have not scored a single goal away from home against a top-six club this season – and that includes the 1-0 FA Cup defeat against Chelsea.
They do retain a shot at next season’s Champions League via the Europa League, where they are 1-0 up against Celta Vigo after the first leg of the semi‑final. Win that competition, return to the Champions League and, with the EFL Cup in the bag, the season is a success. Yet it is plain Mourinho has much work to do and what was remarkable about this defeat which ended United’s 25-match unbeaten run in the league was how meek the manager was about it.
United have been described as injury-ravaged but Mourinho was without only five players because of various ailments – Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. A sixth, Marouane Fellaini, was suspended.
Mourinho’s starting lineup was strong despite the eight changes he made from the first leg in Vigo last Thursday, although he was worried about how Phil Jones and Juan Mata would cope with their first football since late March. The same went for Chris Smalling, who had returned from a similar lay-off as a late substitute against Vigo.
Mourinho, though, would labour the point about how fatigued his squad are, having played three times each week since the beginning of April and certainly there was precious little spark about them.
Arsenal pressed on to the front foot, with United happy to attempt to counter-attack, and the home team had their chances in the first half. Aaron Ramsey drew a fine save out of De Gea from Alexis Sánchez’s through-ball; Welbeck was denied by a desperate Jones block following a corner; and Oxlade-Chamberlain tested De Gea with a deflected blast.
Mourinho had clashed with Wenger midway through the first half after the Arsenal manager complained to the fourth official about a tackle from Rooney on Oxlade-Chamberlain. The home crowd stirred but they truly crackled to life on the one-two punch from Xhaka and Welbeck. Rooney had a couple of efforts towards the end but United could have played on and on and not scored.

“Rock music is a belief system, in a way, and Brian Epstein dedicated everything to the Beatles and to their success. His main concern was their well-being,” said Deller. “In terms of its characters and stories, the way we feel about rock’n’roll music since the Beatles is like religion, or at least an alternative belief system.”
“I am taking a straightforward visual approach to marking the album,” said Deller, who last summer collaborated with the National Theatre’s artistic director Rufus Norris to arrange for hundreds of volunteers to appear across the country dressed as first world war soldiers. “Epstein is someone I have been thinking about for a long time. Without his contribution and sacrifice, the Beatles would not exist as we know them and a lot that we take for granted in our culture would not exist either.”
“Epstein was the band’s friend and helped them more than a little bit,” said Deller. “He was one of a handful of people they could trust.”
The introduction to the book began: “Brian Epstein’s contribution to popular culture is so immense that it is almost too large to comprehend. This might explain why he has been largley written out of the narrative of British popular culture.”
Deller concedes that Epstein is now remembered in the name of a Liverpool theatre, but argues that the Beatles’ manager has not been recognised for the sort of “ultimate sacrifice” that was, at least metaphorically, equivalent to martyrdom.
Epstein came across the band at the Cavern Club in November 1961 and shepherded their early careers. A gay man, he was forced by the laws of the time to keep his private life secret. He was found dead in his bedroom on 27 August 1967, having overdosed on sleeping pills. Homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales a month after his death.
The surviving Beatles, McCartney and Starr, are also to release an anniversary edition package on 26 May, including a new mix of the album by Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin, and Sam Okell that will feature 34 previously unreleased recordings.

Muttonbird, sea plants and eel spines: these native New Zealand ingredients may no longer be components of many diets, but one woman and her cafe are trying to change that.
Jade Temepara, who is of Maori descent, set up Kākano just over a year ago in Christchurch. “Maori people are the unhealthiest, most unfit and most likely to have heart disease – and it’s because of our lifestyle,” says Jade. “Our cause is to bring our traditional food back, and to involve Maori people in the preparation.”
Part cafe, part social enterprise, Kākano was built with the help of the local homeless community on the site of the city’s old convention centre, which was destroyed by the 2011 earthquake. If you walked past it, you’d be forgiven for not noticing the low-rise Portakabin-style building, hidden behind rows of raised garden beds, which are planted with local herbs and vegetables. But it’s more spacious than it appears from the outside, seating 25 (there are an additional 40 seats out on the deck), and though decoration is minimal, the monochrome colour scheme, black and white photos and select few New Zealand handicrafts on display elevate the space.
The whole setup has a distinctly temporary feel, and that’s not by accident: it’s all designed to be “lift and shift”, and in June will be transported from this provisional site to a permanent location just around the corner.
Over the past year, Kākano has built up a strong following among locals, both Maori and non-, and also attracts tourists who, Jade says, “love our story”. Community classes held here – which teach adults and children how to grow and prepare their own food, from fermenting cabbage to gutting fish – always sell out.

The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.

He much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches
At 67, still a man mountain at 6ft 4in, face leathery as a saddle-bag and with his latest hairpiece perfectly in place, it seemed he much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches from toffs in bowler hats and pub brawls to cars leaping across Tower Bridge.
Colourfully and unrestrainedly, it was “fucking” and “goddamn” this, or “shit” and “asshole” that as Wayne, one of Hollywood’s most vocal right-wingers, laid into everything and everyone from “whining radicals who call themselves liberals” and “theatre actors who couldn’t polish a bit player’s shoes” to “bank presidents and stock manipulators running studios who know nothing about motion pictures”.
To make that day even more memorable, his often gleefully intemperate tirades were constantly punctuated by painful throat-clearing and phlegmy hawking which, within minutes, had swiftly evolved into an ear-splitting series of wracking coughs and sonorous spitting (into a hanky).
Yet, as Wayne – who had bravely gone public with his lung cancer, coining the term “The Big C”, just a decade earlier – battled his turbulent throat on this warm day in summer, he never showed any obvious signs of weakening or remotely giving in as I offered the occasional, feeble, “It must be very unpleasant” or “Would you like me to leave?”
Someone once wrote: “Film stars don’t die in Liverpool.” Well, they certainly aren’t meant to peg out in Perivale, west London, either.
In fact, the wheezier he became, the more he seemed to warm to his harangues, which also included “today’s filmmakers who’d let all illusion go out the window”.
When, I asked, would he finally call it a day? “I’m gonna finish,” he declared in that famous drawl, “when they say: ‘Oh, do we have to look at that old sonofabitch again?’”
He died in 1979 after completing just two more pictures.

“It was amazing how beautiful it was,” she told the Guardian on Saturday. “The silver airship against a clear blue sky. How enormous. It was the most exquisite thing I had ever seen.”
Then the zeppelin turned. Its tail swung into view. On it, stark and black, were swastikas.
Her neighbors, she said, gesticulated angrily at the sky.
Not long after, on 6 May 1937, as it was coming in to moor at the naval base at Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Hindenburg caught fire and crashed. Of the 97 people on board, 62 miraculously escaped the burning wreckage. But 22 crew members, 13 passengers and one worker on the ground were killed.
After the disaster, President Franklin Roosevelt and King George sent telegrams of condolence to Hitler.
The Hindenburg crash was the first major transport disaster captured on film, in dramatic footage ever since paired with recorded commentary by a radio reporter who reacted in horror to the shocking scene before him.
Few people directly connected to the disaster are still alive. The lone remaining survivor from the airship itself, Werner Doehner, is now an 88-year-old resident of Colorado.
“Suddenly the air was on fire,” he said this week, speaking to the Associated Press.
The Hindenburg was about 200ft off the ground when it combusted – not “exploded”, as some have since described it. It burned from tail to nose in just 34 seconds but as it collapsed to Earth, Doehner’s mother threw him and his 10-year-old brother from the craft. All three survived.
Just before the fire broke out, however, Werner’s father had gone to the family cabin.
“We didn’t see him again,” Doehner said.
His 14-year-old sister escaped the wreck but rushed back into it to look for their missing father. After emerging without him, she did not survive her burns.
Investigations, however, concluded that a spark of static electricity had most likely ignited leaking hydrogen as, in Zitarosa’s words, “they brought the ship in for landing under thunderstorm conditions”.
It is most widely believed that the leak came from one of the ship’s rear gas containers. What caused the leak is not known. Zitarosa surmised that a broken length of wiring or other piece of hardware somehow ripped the container, which was made of a tough cotton fabric with a film of early latex-type material.
Other factors may have contributed. The Hindenburg was 12 hours late to Lakehurst, having been delayed by strong headwinds across the north Atlantic before spending several hours flying around the area, waiting for storms to clear.
Zeppelins normally took two and a half days to reach the US from Germany, moving twice as fast as an ocean liner. Although the Hindenburg had taken three days, it had plenty of diesel fuel left. It could have flown further.
But passengers, among them dignitaries heading for England and the coronation of King George VI, were waiting. The airship was due to turn around in record time.
Its pilots attempted a so-called high landing, in which ropes were tossed to the ground from around 200ft, for ground crew to pull the giant craft down and secure it to a mooring mast.
Either way, it was known to be extremely dangerous to land in thundery weather. Ground crew members were soaked and there was electricity in the air.
“When the ship dropped its landing ropes, they got wet and acted as conductors,” said Zitarosa. “The ship became grounded and that’s why we think the static electricity made a spark and caught the leaking hydrogen.”
A Chicago radio reporter, Herbert Morrison, bore witness to the raging inferno.
“It burst into flames, it burst into flames!” he cried. “And it’s falling, it’s crashing …it’s crashing terrible … Oh, the humanity … oh, ladies and gentlemen …”
Zeppelins never landed at Lakehurst again. Before long, American dirigibles were taking off from there instead, searching for German submarines.

She in turn called the former economy minister an arrogant, spoilt, cold-eyed, “smirking banker” who was colluding with Islamists, complacent on terrorism and intent on “butchering France” in favour of “big economic interests”.
Both accused the other of taking French people for imbeciles. At one point, after a long attack saying Le Pen was lying to the French public, Macron snapped: “I’m sorry, Madame Le Pen; France deserves better than you.”
Snap polling by Elabe for BFM television just after Le Pen had left the TV studios, accusing Macron of “lies and aggression”, found that a clear majority felt the centrist candidate had been the most convincing. Viewing figures said 16 .5 million people watched the debate.
French media on Thursday declared Macron the winner of a “dirty debate”. Le Pen was criticised for her “permanent aggression” and even normally sympathetic publications found her “unconvincing”.
Libération accused Le Pen of “multiplying attacks and provocations … and thus avoiding any serious debate” while Ruth Elkrief, political editor for BFMTV declared it “not worthy of a presidential election campaign”.
On jobs – one of the biggest concerns in a country that has struggled with decades of mass unemployment — Macron told Le Pen: “Your strategy is simply to tell a lot of lies and just to say what isn’t going right in the country.” She said he favoured “uncontrolled globalisation” and would sell off state assets to the highest bidder.
Although Le Pen was under pressure to flesh out her policy proposals, she spent more time attacking Macron and the record of the outgoing Socialist government.
Terrorism was another key issue after a series of deadly attacks killed more than 230 people in France in just over two years. Le Pen accused Macron of an “indulgent attitude” towards Islamic fundamentalism and said he was slack on fighting extremism. He replied he would be “uncompromising” on terrorism – which he called the biggest issue of the next few years in France – and said the state had to look at the social issues behind why so many terrorists who attacked France were born and raised in France. Le Pen, who this week said “globalisation and Islamism” were the main threats to France, retorted that Macron was lax on Islamism and disregarded French secularism.
Le Pen restated her plan to ban religious symbols from all public places, which would include the Muslim headscarf. Macron warned that her proposals would divide France and lead to “a civil war” and “that’s what terrorists want”. He said: “The terrorists want there to be divisions between us” and accusing his rival of “hate-filled speech”.
On the European Union, the candidates could not have been further apart. Le Pen, who wants to hold a referendum on France leaving the EU, and Macron, who wants closer cooperation, traded more insults on the subject. Le Pen said Macron as president would allow France to be crushed by its economically powerful neighbour Germany and would “lie prostrate” before the powers of Berlin.
“France will be led by a woman, either me or Mrs Merkel,” Le Pen laughed, referring to the German chancellor. He meanwhile attacked her over her muddled stance on the euro. “The euro is the currency of bankers. It’s not the people’s currency,” Le Pen snapped back. Macron responded: “The euro is important. It’s not just a policy.”
Polls this week conducted before the TV debate showed Macron leading by 60% to 40% before the final-round vote on Sunday.
The stage-managed live TV sparring-match is a staple of French election campaigns. The format, in which the candidates face each other across a table for the cameras with no studio audience, has not changed for 40 years. But this bad-tempered exchange, which saw Macron and Le Pen repeatedly exchange insults with rather than expounding on policy, represented a political first.
After France’s two main parties, who had shared power for decades, were knocked out in the first-round vote last month amid anti-establishment anger, the two candidates who faced each other across the table were relative political novices.
The very fact that Le Pen appeared in the debate was considered a major step in normalising her party. In 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the final, the right-wing Jacques Chirac refused to debate him on TV for fear of “normalising hate and intolerance”.
Le Pen has tried to gain a grassroots presence across France and soften her party’s image, attempting to shake off the old jackbooted image of anti-semitism and racism under her Holocaust-denying father, but Macron in rallies has continually described her party as the “party of hatred”.
He said she lacked any knowledge of facts and was “feeding off” French people’s unhappiness. He said she was a “parasite” on the system that she was criticising, manipulating voters’ woes. “What class!” she interjected witheringly.
Le Pen wants a France with closed borders and to prioritise French people over foreigners for jobs, housing and benefits, to send illegal immigrants home, to turn away from the European Union and to abandon free-trade deals. She hopes to solve unemployment by blocking immigration and taxing companies who hire foreigners.
Macron wants to increase European Union cooperation and says France cannot escape the globalised world. He wants to loosen strict labour regulations and reform the eurozone with a common budget.

The interior ministry said turnout at 5pm was 65.3%, noticeably down on 71.96% at the last election in 2012 but in line with pollsters’ projections ahead of the vote. The final abstention rate is set to be 25-27%.
Seen as potentially the most important electoral contest in many years for France and the European Union, it has pitted against each other two candidates with diametrically opposing visions for the future of their country and the continent.
Macron, a 39-year-old former banker and economy minister running as an independent centrist, is economically liberal, socially progressive, globally minded and upbeat. Le Pen is a nation-first protectionist who wants to close France’s borders and possibly leave the euro and the EU.
Macron voted in the coastal town of Le Touquet in northern France alongside his wife, Brigitte, smiling and stopping to pet a black dog as he stepped out of his holiday home in the seaside resort.
For security reasons, he was driven to his nearby polling station at Le Touquet town and shook hands with a large crowd of supporters before entering the building. Le Pen her ballot in Hénin-Beaumont, a small northern town run by her Front National.
She arrived at the polling station with the town’s mayor, Steeve Briois, who took over as the far-right party’s interim leader when she stepped aside last month to concentrate on the campaign.
Feminist activists were briefly detained a couple of hours earlier on Sunday for hanging a big anti-Le Pen banner from a church in the town.
“The commission calls on everyone present on internet sites and social networks – primarily the media, but also all citizens – to show responsibility and not pass on this content so as not to distort the sincerity of the ballot,” the election commission said on Saturday.
Many television news channels opted not even to mention the hack, while Le Monde newspaper said on its website it would not publish any of the nine gigabytes of leaked data before the election – partly because there was too much, and partly because it had clearly been released with the aim of affecting the vote.
“If these documents contain revelations, Le Monde will of course publish them after having investigated them, respecting our journalistic and ethical rules, and without allowing ourselves to be exploited by the publishing calendar of anonymous actors,” the paper said.
The data was posted on a profile called EMLEAKS to Pastebin, a site allowing anonymous document sharing. En Marche! said it was not alarmed by the content, adding the documents “reflected the normal operations of a campaign” but had been mixed with fakes to “sow doubt and disinformation”.
Intelligence agencies in the US said in January that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had ordered hacking of Democratic campaign officials before last year’s presidential election in a bid to boost the chances of Republican candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.
Mainland France’s 47 million voters began casting their ballots at about 70,000 polling stations around the country at 8am (0700 BST). Usually reliable estimates of the result, based on a representative count of actual votes cast, will be released as the last stations close at 8pm (1900 BST).
Voting began in France’s overseas territories on Saturday, starting with Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, an archipelago near the Canadian island of Newfoundland, and continuing in other far-flung overseas territories and French embassies abroad.

Britain has more billionaires than ever in what equality campaigners said was a clear sign the UK economy is only working for the few at the top.
“While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain’s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions,” said Robert Watts, the compiler of the rich list.
Today, the Hinduja Group employs more than 70,000 people and has global investments in a range of sectors including oil and gas, property, media and banking. Current projects include the transformation of the Old War Office in Westminster into a luxury hotel.
The Equality Trust said the £83bn increase in wealth among the richest 1,000 people over the past year could pay the energy bills of all UK households for two and a half years and would be enough for the grocery bills for all food bank users for 56 years.
Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust, said that an elite was sitting on mountains of wealth in the fifth largest economy of the world. “The super-rich continue to streak away from the rest of us, while the poorest see their wealth shrink. This is an economy working for the few, not the many,” she said.
“Record numbers of people visited food banks last year, millions are locked out of a decent home and two-thirds of children in poverty are in working households.
“We know that inequality damages our economy and society, and makes it harder for ordinary people and their children to get on. With the general election fast approaching, our politicians need to decide the sort of country they want to build. One where we can all prosper or one where we’re picking crumbs from the super-rich’s table.”
At least 28 of the top 100 individuals or families in the rich list have donated to the Conservative party or individual Tory politicians, according to the Electoral Commission’s records. Among them are David and Simon Reuben, third on the list, who donated to Boris Johnson.
Others in the top 10 who donated to the party include Guy, George and Galen Weston and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, who donated to the West Suffolk Conservatives.
The combined wealth of all the Conservative donors on the list is £102bn, according to the analysis by Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. “The fact that nearly a third of UK’s 100 richest people have given money to the Tories tells you all you need to know about where Theresa May’s priorities lie,” Watson said. “She claims to speak for working people but she’s beholden to the billionaires that bankroll her party.”
Watts said there was more diversity in this years’ rich list. “More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with private equity barons and hedge fund managers.”

“I want teams to be worried that they have drawn Argentina,” he said, adding that, if his players were where he intended them to be come the World Cup, it would not matter whom they were up against, not that he will be dancing a jig if the Pumas find themselves facing the All Blacks again. As they are ninth in the rankings, they could be pooled with the holders, New Zealand, and their Rugby Championship rivals South Africa, whose annus horribilis in 2016 led to them slipping out of the top four.
Although 20 countries will take part in the World Cup, there will be only 12 names in the draw: the teams that finished in the top three of their groups in 2015. They have been split into three groups according to their position in the rankings: New Zealand, England, Australia and Ireland occupy the first tier, meaning they will avoid each other; then come Scotland, France, South Africa and Wales; and Argentina, Japan, Georgia and Italy form the third wave.
The other eight teams will be decided after qualifying matches in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Whoever draws Argentina could land Fiji, who were the other victims in England’s pool in 2015, Samoa or Tonga; or two of them.
Akira Shimazu, president of the tournament’s organising committee, has said: “Japan is preparing to welcome the world. We are committed to Rugby World Cup and we’re aiming to deliver the best yet. It will be a celebration of rugby and of Japanese culture as we will show off the best of our country and our hospitality on a global stage. The last World Cup was a great success but our task is not to emulate England but to make it a very Japanese event.”
Before the draw World Rugby will debate extending the residential qualification period for Test players. It is currently three years, but member unions are set to agree a recommendation to increase it to five. The change would not be retrospective and would not prevent the Sale wing Denny Solomona, who recently became available for England under the three-year rule, from touring Argentina with Eddie Jones’s side next month.

The go-ahead for the nation state bill by the ministerial committee for legislation means it will now move forward to a vote by the country’s parliament. The bill has to pass several stages in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for it to become law and could also be challenged in the courts.
Critics say the law is discriminatory and could undermine Israel’s balance of being both a Jewish and democratic state by harming the rights of minorities.
Hebrew and Arabic are both Israel’s national languages, but the bill states that Hebrew would be the lone national language, downgrading Arabic to “a special status in the state” whose “speakers have the right to language-accessible state services”.
The legislation is designed to be enshrined in Israel’s basic law, regarded as the closest approximation in Israel to a constitution.
The timing of the bill – after four years of deliberations – is significant, coming two weeks before a planned visit by Donald Trump in which the US president had hoped to breath life into a moribund peace process.
Although the bill has undergone some changes in the drafting process – not least removing language that would have seen Israel’s democracy subordinated in importance to its Jewish identity – it remains highly contentious.
While the way Israel’s legislative process functions has long allowed parties and individuals to put forward legislation likely to be challenged by the courts, the latest proposed law comes in the context of Israel’s most rightwing ever government.
The committee approved the bill unanimously but the measure has been condemned by opposition politicians, academics and in some parts of the Israeli media.
Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, representing Arab-Israeli parties, said the bill was a “declaration of war” on Israel’s Arab citizens. “Discrimination has received a legal stamp. The danger in this law in that it establishes two classes of citizen – Jewish and Arab,” he said.
Erel Margalit, a contender for the leadership of the centrist Zionist Union party, called the bill “reminiscent of dark periods” in history.
Zehava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, said the bill’s intention was to downgrade the rights of non-Jews in Israel. “The result of the Jewish state bill is clear. Jews will get preference over all other citizens, clearly violating human rights, democracy and the rights of the Arab minority in Israel,” she said.
The bill’s sponsor, Avi Dichter, an MP from Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, defended the proposals, as did other ministers.
 ”This is a small step for the Jewish state bill, which establishes that Israel is and will be a Jewish and democratic state, and it’s a big step towards defining our identity, not only in the eyes of the world but primarily for ourselves, Israelis – to be a free people in our land,” said Dichter after the committee’s vote.
He said the bill was necessary because “events of recent months prove that this is a battle for Israel’s image and national identity. The Palestinians no longer hide their goal of erasing the Jewish people’s nation state”.
The legislative committee’s chairman, Yariv Levin, also a Likud MP, said he had decided to put an end to foot-dragging over the bill. “We’ve been waiting to discuss and make a decision on this legislation for too long. This is a basic law, which has the simple objective of safeguarding Israel’s status as the nation state of the Jewish people. I don’t understand why it hasn’t been made into law so far,” he said.

Hargreaves, who is now retired after founding the Hargreaves Lansdown financial services company, said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of EU nationals before the delicate negotiations over Brexit. However, he said, May should simply “make the gesture” and not wait until Brussels agreed to do the same for UK nationals living in EU states.
It coincides with concern among some senior Brexit backers over May’s approach to immigration after Brexit.
Hargreaves said he was happy to see EU nationals already here maintain their current rights. “Most of those are in work and adding to our economy,” he said. “We are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future, but I think there should have been that comfort given, because they came under different circumstances.”
Wolfson said: “While it is important and essential that Britain controls who comes into this country, and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers … it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge.
“We are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war. If we are too draconian on immigration, it will have two adverse effects on our economy. The first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth, and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world.
“The most important thing to come out of Brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world – that Britain is an open country, a free trading country, one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it.”
Marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures, arguing that universities “must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post-Brexit economy”.
“It is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no-brainer to take students out of the migration numbers,” he said.
“Polling of Brexit voters even shows strong support for this change. People in the north and Midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector. They are simply not worried about student migration.”

Their capes bear the slogan: “Lafiyar al’ummarmu hakkin kowa da kowa ne” – “The health of the child is the responsibilty of all.” The lunchboxes are filled with ice and polio vaccine. They have marker pens to dab on the finger of each treated child and chalk to mark every house wall they visit, marking which child was vaccinated and when. No one is to be missed out.
Ismail has mixed feelings as he watches, his useless legs tucked under him in the dust. He contracted polio aged two. “I blame my parents,” he says, “for not having me vaccinated, it makes me angry with them. I don’t feel so glad to see this today, I feel sad.”
Meanwhile, in a nearby village, other gunmen were slaughtering eight women, another team of volunteers. Three days before, a radio show had run an item in which an imam repeated allegations that the polio vaccine was a western plot to sterilise Muslims.
“I can say this,” said Musa. “Without Boko Haram polio would be a thing of the past. Some say health is not the problem; security is. They are linked. If we hear one child in Maiduguri has polio, then that means there are 200. So what if there are 10 children there? And very many children are coming out of the conflict zone. We don’t know, so we have to work harder. We persuade people by educating them. You make them understand. We have reduced the non-compliance rate here now to almost zero. I tell our workers ‘your names are written in gold’.”
But with some religious leaders sharing the distrust, what should have been a celebration of a disease eradicated is now a renewed struggle to finish a job that should have been over. Since the outbreak in Boko Haram-controlled territory, northern Nigeria has been in emergency mode. Teams of vaccinators are out almost constantly. “I almost cried,” said Rhoda Samson, “but not to finish the job is not acceptable.”
A supervisor in the mobilisation teams, Samson is thorough, checking every move her teams make. They visit a woman whose five-day-old baby still has no name. The chalk on the wall outside shows a list of visits here. “Seven times they have said no,” said Samson as her team coo over the baby. “Bamaso,” said the mother, Amina Ali. “We don’t want. My husband says vaccine is not food, why do the government not give us food? He refused and has not offended God.”
At this her husband, Ali Zaki, returns home, angry at the invasion of his house: “I believe God will provide; this is what we are taught.” But he is no match for Samson: “You think God doesn’t make the medicines? You want your children to have polio? To never play? Does Allah want that? What kind of man are you?”
When Zaki grudgingly agrees, the vaccine is quickly slipped into the baby’s mouth and the women clatter off, congratulating the couple. “They’ve a lot of reasons for refusing. We have some who don’t want drugs at all, some who say they won’t because they want something in return, some hear the stories,” said Samson. “The security situation is a problem. People are suspicious, they hear vaccinations make infertility. But we are bringing the numbers of non-compliants down; we will not stop.”
And they are not just fighting polio – they are creating a network and collecting data in a way never before done in Nigeria. A network of trained, community-based health workers, it’s a structure already being used to deliver other healthcare.
Senior state and government officials have recognised the value of this, gracing the polio flag-offs. In their elegant robes and themed hats, and long, often less elegant political speeches, their presence stresses to everyone in the fidgeting crowds of locals that something important is happening here. It is the kind of message that could reverse the damage done by Boko Haram, says Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, Kano’s health commissioner. “Kano used to be a hub of polio cases, now it’s best practice. The last case was 2014 and this did not happen by accident. The teams are headed by the governor himself, it’s high profile This is how we do it. We go into the field every day, every day the volunteers are out there. Then we can use these structures to develop an entire primary healthcare system.”
Displaced people are especially targeted in this campaign. Abule Abdullah has hosted seven families – seven mothers and 33 children – in her home in Katsina state. One of her current guests is Aisha Idris, 40, recently arrived from Maiduguri.
“Boko Haram forced us to come here. The insurgency has stopped everything, the hospitals, the schools, everything is shut down,” she said. “My husband was killed at his Islamic reading group by a stray bullet from the fighting. My child was sick and so I came here with my children. I have to live with no roof over our heads but they have all been vaccinated now.” At the bus stations, and the state and national border crossings, the lunchbox-toting teams are there. Peering into cars, lifting the cloaks of women perched on motorbikes to find the babies strapped to their fronts and backs. Squeezing in the little vials of vaccine.
“If they say no, then we tell them they can go back,” said superintendent of immigration, Charles Tashllani, imposing order on Nigeria’s border with Niger in Katsina. Here, late in the evening, the Polio Emergency Operations committee reviews the campaign’s first day, which has seen 3,661 teams immunise 28,882 underfives. The detail is such that eight missing marker pens are on the agenda, as is the sacking of two town announcers who did not inform people about the programme.
“We look at every single child, everyone counts to us. I’m dealing with human beings. But we do have the iceberg phenomenon: many inaccessible, remote areas where we do not always know what is going on.
“People not feeling that polio is a threat to them, that is a big worry for a resurgence. But the biggest threat to health is Boko Haram. When we learned we had Borno refugees here in Katsina we were worried; they melt into the communities. It is potentially dangerous.”
The legacy of polio can be seen everywhere in Nigeria. Aminu Ahmen el-Wada lives with Hadza, his wife of 28 years, and those of their nine children who still live at home. One of life’s cheerful souls, he is enormously proud of the length of their marriage. “The trick is when I am the problem, I say sorry, when she is the problem, she says sorry,” says Wada.
The couple both skim along the floor using wooden handles Wada designed and carved to protect their hands – when your legs are withered from polio and are folded tiny and useless below your torso, your arms are the limbs that propel you. “I went to school until I became too heavy for my parents to carry me there,” said Wada. “So I taught myself to make hand-operated cycles, first for myself, then for others.” He now employs 20 people, 15 polio survivors. “Otherwise we would be beggars. This is because in Africa nobody can help you if you are disabled. But my father told me: ‘Disabled is in the body, not in the mind or in the heart,’ and this is what I believe.”
His smile falters only when he introduces Ummar, 14. His son contracted polio during a hiatus in the immunisation programme. “It was horrible. But the place behind our house is where people defecate. This is what happens.”
Wada began the Polio Survivors Group, which supports the vaccination drives. “I tell people: ‘Look at me. Do you want your child to end up like this? To never play football?’” Although he acknowledges the irony in that he also coaches a polio survivors’ para-football team. “But they would rather play for Arsenal,” he grins.
In his open-air workshop by the side of a main road in Fagge, the air smells poisonous as the men who would otherwise be beggars weld, cut and paint, making the three-wheeled, arm-operated cycles that give a certain freedom of movement. “This is the small size, for age five, then they can move up, age teenage, age adult,” he says. “One day I would like it that we make no more because polio is eradicated. Then we will make playground equipment instead, slides for happier children.”
He fires up his beaming smile: “Years ago in Nigeria we had leprosy, smallpox. We chased them all away. Now the last one is polio.”

This system is deemed to be democratic because people elect governments and can always vote them out; it’s capitalist because corporations are constrained by the logic of competition, which prizes efficiency, innovation and infinite expansion. That logic, with its penchant for creative destruction of all things stale and permanent, can produce toxic results – which is precisely why government action is needed. Such, at any rate, is the social democratic consensus accepted by both centre-left and centre-right parties.
The questions of war and security – and the existential imperatives that they impose on the most democratic of societies – have always posed unresolved challenges to this framework, as can be glimpsed from occasional warnings about the military-industrial complex expressed by many a political insider nearing retirement. Thus, standard democratic procedures are regularly suspended as governments demand tighter control over the flow of information, classify more of their internal communications and expand surveillance without any requisite checks and balances.
The standard critique of such practices attacks the undemocratic-because-unaccountable activities of the so-called “deep state”. Rooted in campaigns to defend privacy, opponents aim to make the deep state shallower – ideally by means of legal interventions aimed at restoring transparency and accountability. The real problem, they argue, is with the malfunctioning of democracy – we could easily ignore the capitalist part of “democratic capitalism”: we just need more and better legal instruments to tame the intelligence agencies.
Governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies – they are engaging in toxic activities of their own
Alas, the world in 2017 is not so easy to pigeonhole into the neat compartments of this scheme. Consider just one example: cyber-security. Plenty of rogue states are, indeed, busy hacking the servers of their adversaries in western Europe or North America. Likewise, there’s no denying that non-state hackers, operating for commercial or patriotic motives, have damaged their targets.
They do this for motives that some might view as noble: to identify early signs of terrorist activity, to track down criminals, to disable devices that might be part of sophisticated plots to wreak havoc on our cities. Whatever the motives, we should not lose sight of the larger political effects produced by such actions.
First, the expansion (and even the maintenance) of the surveillance capabilities of democratic governments presupposes a permanent structural insecurity of our communication networks. That insecurity, in turn, gets exploited not just by democratic governments but by anyone else, including all those rogue states and non-state hackers. However, once insecurity is structural, the right response is not more security, but more insurance. This explains why cyber-insurance has become one of the most promising segments of the insurance market, with even sectors like manufacturing (itself increasingly wired up and interconnected) needing to spend more and more to insure against disruptive cyber-attacks.
In essence, cyber-insurance – like any other form of insurance – is a domain of rentiers who are keen to extract a regular premium payment from those needing their services. The truly innovative element here is that the risk that creates this new class of rentiers exists partly – and, one could even say, mostly – because of government activity.
Here, the logic of democratic capitalism is no more: governments are not restraining the toxic activities of companies; rather, they engage in toxic activities of their own, which companies mitigate with activities that are either more or less toxic – depending on one’s views about the parasitic nature of economic activities pursued by rentiers. The second political effect of the ever-expanding surveillance apparatus is the disadvantage it creates for small companies and non-profits, not to mention individuals. Remember the early utopian vision of a digital world, where we would all be running our own mail servers and, with time, might even master our own version of the connected home?
Well, today we demand more autonomy at our own risk: given the sophistication of cyber-attacks – which both aim to steal data and overwhelm sites with fake traffic – it’s obvious that the only actors capable of defending ordinary users, be they individuals or corporations, are big tech firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This, too, violates the basic premise of democratic capitalism: citizens are encouraged to seek protection from companies, not governments.
When both spam and security threats are assessed using the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, one can forget about any other, smaller player being able to compete with such firms that use the structural insecurity created by governments to further consolidate their near-monopoly status.
Democratic capitalism is thus always democratic monopoly capitalism – and even more so in its digital version. The idea that the normal imperatives of capitalist competition would exert extra pressure on digital giants seems quaint. There’s no garage big enough to house a startup that can unseat Google, not with its trove of customer data and artificial intelligence.
The third effect of this new post-democratic compromise is that, in presenting cyber-insecurity as a natural rather than human-made problem, it delegitimises the role of law – and politics in general – in mitigating conflicts between citizens and corporations. Consider how we deal with other types of disasters. It would be imprudent to rely on the power of law and politics to ward off floods and earthquakes; insurance, under these conditions, is not an unreasonable option. But none of this prevents us from requiring stricter building standards so as to minimise the damage when the disaster does strike.
The world of cyber-security does not follow this logic. Imagine if the government regularly dispatched a group of well-paid and well-educated saboteurs to weaken the anti-flood or anti-earthquake defences of our houses, leaving us no option but to turn to the private sector for security, either in the form of better defences or better insurance. This is the situation we are in right now; the only difference is that cyber-security disasters are almost entirely human-made and thus avoidable.
Rhetorically, the governments might even agree that, in the face of all these dangers, we all need to strengthen our privacy laws. In reality, though, we all know that it would only result in them sending even more saboteurs – with even more powerful tools – to weaken our defences. Who, under these conditions, would retain any faith in law and politics, rather than accept protections promised by the market, however flawed and expensive?
Cyber-security, alas, is just one of the many examples where the legitimacy of democratic capitalism – as well as of the social democratic parties that have traditionally defended it – has expired, even if its talking points are still in circulation. No wonder that social democratic parties are collapsing, as elections in the Netherlands and France have shown: they claim to be defending a system that no longer walks the talk.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Hak Song had worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before he was held on Saturday.
“A relevant institution is now conducting detailed investigation into his crimes,” the KCNA said.
Kim Sang Duk was arrested at the Pyongyang International Airport on 22 April, the KCNA said. It said he was “intercepted for committing criminal acts” to overthrow the North’s government, but didn’t elaborate.
On Sunday, the KCNA did not say whether the two cases were connected.
In Washington, the state department said it was aware of the report of the new detention and that “the security of US citizens is one of the department’s highest priorities”.
Kim Hak Song and Kim Sang Duk are among at least four Americans being detained in North Korea, as tensions between the two countries continue.
The others are Otto Warmbier, who is serving a 15-year prison term with hard labor for alleged anti-state acts, and Kim Dong Chul, serving a 10-year term with hard labor for alleged espionage.
Washington, Seoul and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, which in recent years have involved high-profile American missions sent to secure releases.
When an American citizen is reported detained, the US works with the Swedish embassy in the North Korean capital, since the US and the North do not have diplomatic relations.
The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is the only privately funded university in North Korea and is unique for having a large number of foreign staff.

Bzzz. Bzzz. I can still remember the sound and the feeling of having my head shaved for the first time. It was a warm evening in July, I had some kind of throat infection and we were about to go on holiday. I had been dyeing my hair various colours of the rainbow since I was 12. The only options I had left were green or … shaved. I was about to start a new job and felt, for a few reasons, that I was starting again. Shaved it would be. As my hair dropped to the floor, and we went shorter and shorter with the clippers, I felt lighter, liberated, ecstatic. It sounds ridiculous, but the effect was so powerful that my tonsils, or whatever it was, stopped hurting.
I had recently stopped drinking and I wanted to cut off the past and its boozy repetitions, to shed a side of me that was dangerous and destructive. I wanted to raze myself to ground zero and build myself back up again. Shaving my head felt like the most elemental and easy way to do it. Perhaps it was also a reaction against a conception of life as a sober person. It felt like an emboldening, a taking control of my identity, something anarchic and subversive in the face of a lifetime of Diet Coke, tea and early-to-bed. It also felt a bit brave, as if by doing it I could front away the fear of life without my crutch. In those early months, I felt raw, as if my skin had been removed, and having a shaved head somehow made me feel stronger.
When you find yourself drunk all the time, or hungover, your self-esteem can take a kicking. It took time to build mine back, but having a shaved head gave me a starting point. It also affirmed in me the simple concept of growth as intrinsic to life (well, for a while), that things change and move forward. Hair grows. Patterns can be broken. Neurons adapt.
The reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Friends seemed to like it, but elderly relatives? Not so much. My mother cried the first time she saw it, because she thought I looked ill. A friend’s mother told me it looked awful and scary. My grandmother was upset because it reminded her of images of people in Nazi concentration camps. I was a lot more comfortable at a festival or in a city rather than the rural corners of Scotland or the news desk of the newspaper where I was working at the time.
It is true that, historically, a shaved head is associated with some pretty bad stuff. Deposed emperors in Byzantium would have their heads shaved, along with castration and disfigurement. The Merovingians shaved the heads of dethroned kings or failed successors. French women who slept with German soldiers in the second world war had their heads shaved and were then paraded through the streets. It has been used as a tool to shame, dehumanise and mark in different cultures. It’s not all bad, though: Grace Jones said that shaving her head led directly to her first orgasm.
I kept my head shaved for a couple of years, enjoying the ease of my husband getting his clippers out, not costing a penny, wash and go. I loved the way my scalp felt like a velvety vole. But in a way, it was high maintenance. It required makeup and a proper outfit. And growing it out was a bore.

Three Australian swimmers are facing two-year bans from all competitions for missing three drugs tests over a period of 12 months.
“Swimming Australia confirms it has recently been informed by Asada and Fina that members of the Australian Dolphins Swim team may have failed to update their whereabouts appropriately over the previous 12-month period,” the Australian team said in a statement on Sunday.
All athletes in registered drug testing pools of international federations and national anti-doping organisations are required to provide their whereabouts for one hour every day (between 5am-11pm) when they will be available for testing. Asada said that at the point of each missed test, athletes have the opportunity to put forward an explanation before a missed test declaration was made.
Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson said he would be disappointed if protocols weren’t followed by the swimmers. “Both Swimming Australia and our athletes have been very clear on our position in relation to anti-doping both here in Australia and internationally,” Anderson said in a statement. 
“The Australian Dolphins Swim Team has worked hard to develop a culture of professionalism and respect. Part of that professionalism is ensuring each athlete is accountable and responsible for accurately providing their locations so testers can access them when required. It is extremely disappointing if this has not occurred as it should.”

The chalk on the wall outside shows a list of visits here. “Seven times they have said no,” said Samson as her team coo over the baby. “Bamaso,” said the mother, Amina Ali. “We don’t want. My husband says vaccine is not food, why do the government not give us food? He refused and has not offended God.”
At this her husband, Ali Zaki, returns home, angry at the invasion of his house: “I believe God will provide; this is what we are taught.” But he is no match for Samson: “You think God doesn’t make the medicines? You want your children to have polio? To never play? Does Allah want that? What kind of man are you?”
When Zaki grudgingly agrees, the vaccine is quickly slipped into the baby’s mouth and the women clatter off, congratulating the couple. “They’ve a lot of reasons for refusing. We have some who don’t want drugs at all, some who say they won’t because they want something in return, some hear the stories,” said Samson. “The security situation is a problem. People are suspicious, they hear vaccinations make infertility. But we are bringing the numbers of non-compliants down; we will not stop.”
And they are not just fighting polio – they are creating a network and collecting data in a way never before done in Nigeria. A network of trained, community-based health workers, it’s a structure already being used to deliver other healthcare.
Senior state and government officials have recognised the value of this, gracing the polio flag-offs. In their elegant robes and themed hats, and long, often less elegant political speeches, their presence stresses to everyone in the fidgeting crowds of locals that something important is happening here. It is the kind of message that could reverse the damage done by Boko Haram, says Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, Kano’s health commissioner. “Kano used to be a hub of polio cases, now it’s best practice. The last case was 2014 and this did not happen by accident. The teams are headed by the governor himself, it’s high profile This is how we do it. We go into the field every day, every day the volunteers are out there. Then we can use these structures to develop an entire primary healthcare system.”
Displaced people are especially targeted in this campaign. Abule Abdullah has hosted seven families – seven mothers and 33 children – in her home in Katsina state. One of her current guests is Aisha Idris, 40, recently arrived from Maiduguri.
“Boko Haram forced us to come here. The insurgency has stopped everything, the hospitals, the schools, everything is shut down,” she said. “My husband was killed at his Islamic reading group by a stray bullet from the fighting. My child was sick and so I came here with my children. I have to live with no roof over our heads but they have all been vaccinated now.” At the bus stations, and the state and national border crossings, the lunchbox-toting teams are there. Peering into cars, lifting the cloaks of women perched on motorbikes to find the babies strapped to their fronts and backs. Squeezing in the little vials of vaccine.
“If they say no, then we tell them they can go back,” said superintendent of immigration, Charles Tashllani, imposing order on Nigeria’s border with Niger in Katsina. Here, late in the evening, the Polio Emergency Operations committee reviews the campaign’s first day, which has seen 3,661 teams immunise 28,882 underfives. The detail is such that eight missing marker pens are on the agenda, as is the sacking of two town announcers who did not inform people about the programme.
“We look at every single child, everyone counts to us. I’m dealing with human beings. But we do have the iceberg phenomenon: many inaccessible, remote areas where we do not always know what is going on.
“People not feeling that polio is a threat to them, that is a big worry for a resurgence. But the biggest threat to health is Boko Haram. When we learned we had Borno refugees here in Katsina we were worried; they melt into the communities. It is potentially dangerous.”
The legacy of polio can be seen everywhere in Nigeria. Aminu Ahmen el-Wada lives with Hadza, his wife of 28 years, and those of their nine children who still live at home. One of life’s cheerful souls, he is enormously proud of the length of their marriage. “The trick is when I am the problem, I say sorry, when she is the problem, she says sorry,” says Wada.
The couple both skim along the floor using wooden handles Wada designed and carved to protect their hands – when your legs are withered from polio and are folded tiny and useless below your torso, your arms are the limbs that propel you. “I went to school until I became too heavy for my parents to carry me there,” said Wada. “So I taught myself to make hand-operated cycles, first for myself, then for others.” He now employs 20 people, 15 polio survivors. “Otherwise we would be beggars. This is because in Africa nobody can help you if you are disabled. But my father told me: ‘Disabled is in the body, not in the mind or in the heart,’ and this is what I believe.”
His smile falters only when he introduces Ummar, 14. His son contracted polio during a hiatus in the immunisation programme. “It was horrible. But the place behind our house is where people defecate. This is what happens.”
Wada began the Polio Survivors Group, which supports the vaccination drives. “I tell people: ‘Look at me. Do you want your child to end up like this? To never play football?’” Although he acknowledges the irony in that he also coaches a polio survivors’ para-football team. “But they would rather play for Arsenal,” he grins.
In his open-air workshop by the side of a main road in Fagge, the air smells poisonous as the men who would otherwise be beggars weld, cut and paint, making the three-wheeled, arm-operated cycles that give a certain freedom of movement. “This is the small size, for age five, then they can move up, age teenage, age adult,” he says. “One day I would like it that we make no more because polio is eradicated. Then we will make playground equipment instead, slides for happier children.”
He fires up his beaming smile: “Years ago in Nigeria we had leprosy, smallpox. We chased them all away. Now the last one is polio.”

This was a staggering, historic high for the anti-European, anti-immigration party that during the campaign was slammed by political opponents as racist, xenophobic, antisemitic and anti-Muslim despite Le Pen’s public relations efforts to detoxify its image in recent years. 
Political scientists have warned that no one should write off the French far right after Marine Le Pen’s presidential loss. The Front National has slowly been gaining ground for the last 45 years and its steady electoral increases must be seen in the long term. The issues that the party has sought to focus on and capitalise from – the terrorist threat, the refugee crisis, immigration, mass unemployment, deindustrialisation, voters who struggle to make ends meet – are unlikely to instantly disappear.
“The Front National is not finished,” said Jean-Yves Camus, director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean-Jaurès foundation in Paris. “We have no reason to believe that the job market will change for the better in the next few years. We have no reason to believe that the negative impact of globalisation will stop during the years to come. So there might be a drop in the Front National vote, but if the situation is bad in 2022 [at the time of the next presidential election], they could rise again.”
The Front National’s immediate focus now is the French parliamentary election to be held in two rounds on 11 and 18 June. The party only has two MPs in the 577-seat French national assembly and the current voting system – which does not feature proportional representation – makes it hard for the far right to translate millions of presidential votes into constituency seats. The Front National is hoping to win at least 15 MPs, which would be enough to have its own parliamentary grouping, but much depends on how the left, right and Macron’s new centrist En Marche! movement decide to field opposing candidates. 
Party strategists must now decide whether this can be translated to seats in parliament. Le Pen has not said if she will run for parliament herself.

They are blaming Simon Mayo for 'normalising' drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus
Yes, obviously the DJs mentioned booze loads and repeatedly implied that it was fine and nice. As Northumbria’s associate professor of public health and wellbeing put it: “Alcohol consumption is often portrayed as the norm without negative consequences, and just 5% of references on all stations were about sensible drinking.” That’s a lot more discussion of sensible drinking than I would’ve expected.
This is a bit of a soft target, you might think. Leave the guys at Northumbria University alone. If they can get funding for counting the number of times Steve Wright mentions Lambrusco, maybe I should wish them luck. But I don’t. Because it’s another case of people scrutinising how other people talk and vetting them for inadvertent divergences from an approved value system. A mild case, perhaps – these guys aren’t no-platforming Peter Tatchell – but they are blaming Simon Mayo for “normalising” drunkenness. I’m pretty sure it’s been normal since Dionysus. The study will probably be ignored but, in these inane times, you just can’t be completely sure.
So it might be worth saying something obvious: DJs on the radio have to talk like human beings – the specific human beings they happen to be. That’s the premise of this form of entertainment: natural chat interspersed with music. It’s not high culture but it passes the time in heavy traffic.
But it won’t work if the people at the microphone, desperately trying to keep the energy up, also have to reflect some externally imposed consensus of how life should be lived. That’s Thought for the Day, which is scripted in advance and lasts under three minutes. Any longer than that and it really would drive listeners to drink…

When we say “addict”, we rarely think of people aged over 65. You might think this is uncommon. It isn’t. People expect to live longer, so they’re not slowing down just because they’re in their 60s. It shouldn’t be a surprise that we are seeing substance misuse, dependence and addiction in older people: think how many old fashioneds Don Draper got through in each episode.
We are woefully unprepared to meet the needs of older people struggling with substance misuse. So what will happen in 2030, when members of Generation X – the twentysomethings who popped pills at warehouse raves in the 1990s – start to turn 65? Addiction in older age is not a problem that’s going to go away. By 2030, nearly a quarter of the population in England will be over 65. That’s around 12 million people. We’re sitting on a ticking time bomb, waiting for the inevitable fallout of each generation overindulging in its substance of choice.
Lifetime use of cannabis and cocaine in 65- to 74-year-olds increased seven-fold and five-fold respectively between 2000 and 2014. In the last 10 years, the number of people in that age group admitted to hospital for drug-related mental health problems, such as psychosis, rose from 181 to 1,345. Use of prescription drugs for pleasure is also on the rise in older people, with opiates and medication for insomnia often used for non-medical reasons. As addiction services are being dismantled, more baby boomers with illicit drug misuse are entering old-age psychiatry services. Snorting cocaine, smoking cannabis or experimenting with psychoactive substances shouldn’t raise the eyebrows of psychiatrists providing care in older people’s mental health services, but even I initially failed my MRCPsych exams for lacking the necessary expertise on substance misuse. I didn’t realise how central it was to old-age psychiatry.
We wrongly assume that substance misuse is a younger person’s problem and there are huge challenges in increasing access to services for older people because of this.
When they do, they need care that not only addresses misuse, but takes into account chronic physical health problems and mental health conditions such as dementia. Treatment also has to manage the normal physical pain of ageing and the unfortunate truth of social isolation and bereavement.
Sadly, I see a future in which poly-substance misuse in older people is common. We have a lot of catching up to do to provide services for substance abuse beyond alcohol and tobacco. Baby boomers are the generation that laughed off inebriation, saw alcohol advertised daily on television and thought relaxation was more about smoking a joint than mindfulness.
But at what age do we assume people “grow out” of the pub night three times a week or smoking cannabis? The “you’re only young once” approach can easily go from a relaxed attitude in middle age to dependence and addiction in older life.
Substance misuse in the over-65s may seem strange because we characterise older people as fusty, but it’s not surprising that the attitudes of youth carry into later life. If we continue to ignore substance misuse in people over 65, we are closing the door on ensuring their quality of life as 70, 80 or 90-year-olds. In 2017, that door is still barely ajar.

She in turn called the former economy minister an arrogant, spoilt, cold-eyed, “smirking banker” who was colluding with Islamists, complacent on terrorism and intent on “butchering France” in favour of “big economic interests”.
Both accused the other of taking French people for imbeciles. At one point, after a long attack saying Le Pen was lying to the French public, Macron snapped: “I’m sorry, Madame Le Pen; France deserves better than you.” 
Snap polling by Elabe for BFM television just after Le Pen had left the TV studios, accusing Macron of “lies and aggression”, found that a clear majority felt the centrist candidate had been the most convincing. Viewing figures said 16 .5 million people watched the debate.
French media on Thursday declared Macron the winner of a “dirty debate”. Le Pen was criticised for her “permanent aggression” and even normally sympathetic publications found her “unconvincing”. 
Libération accused Le Pen of “multiplying attacks and provocations … and thus avoiding any serious debate” while Ruth Elkrief, political editor for BFMTV declared it “not worthy of a presidential election campaign”.
On jobs – one of the biggest concerns in a country that has struggled with decades of mass unemployment — Macron told Le Pen: “Your strategy is simply to tell a lot of lies and just to say what isn’t going right in the country.” She said he favoured “uncontrolled globalisation” and would sell off state assets to the highest bidder.
Although Le Pen was under pressure to flesh out her policy proposals, she spent more time attacking Macron and the record of the outgoing Socialist government.
Terrorism was another key issue after a series of deadly attacks killed more than 230 people in France in just over two years. Le Pen accused Macron of an “indulgent attitude” towards Islamic fundamentalism and said he was slack on fighting extremism. He replied he would be “uncompromising” on terrorism – which he called the biggest issue of the next few years in France – and said the state had to look at the social issues behind why so many terrorists who attacked France were born and raised in France. Le Pen, who this week said “globalisation and Islamism” were the main threats to France, retorted that Macron was lax on Islamism and disregarded French secularism.
Le Pen restated her plan to ban religious symbols from all public places, which would include the Muslim headscarf. Macron warned that her proposals would divide France and lead to “a civil war” and “that’s what terrorists want”. He said: “The terrorists want there to be divisions between us” and accusing his rival of “hate-filled speech”.
On the European Union, the candidates could not have been further apart. Le Pen, who wants to hold a referendum on France leaving the EU, and Macron, who wants closer cooperation, traded more insults on the subject. Le Pen said Macron as president would allow France to be crushed by its economically powerful neighbour Germany and would “lie prostrate” before the powers of Berlin. 
“France will be led by a woman, either me or Mrs Merkel,” Le Pen laughed, referring to the German chancellor. He meanwhile attacked her over her muddled stance on the euro. “The euro is the currency of bankers. It’s not the people’s currency,” Le Pen snapped back. Macron responded: “The euro is important. It’s not just a policy.”
Polls this week conducted before the TV debate showed Macron leading by 60% to 40% before the final-round vote on Sunday.
The stage-managed live TV sparring-match is a staple of French election campaigns. The format, in which the candidates face each other across a table for the cameras with no studio audience, has not changed for 40 years. But this bad-tempered exchange, which saw Macron and Le Pen repeatedly exchange insults with rather than expounding on policy, represented a political first.
After France’s two main parties, who had shared power for decades, were knocked out in the first-round vote last month amid anti-establishment anger, the two candidates who faced each other across the table were relative political novices. 
The very fact that Le Pen appeared in the debate was considered a major step in normalising her party. In 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the final, the right-wing Jacques Chirac refused to debate him on TV for fear of “normalising hate and intolerance”. 
Le Pen has tried to gain a grassroots presence across France and soften her party’s image, attempting to shake off the old jackbooted image of anti-semitism and racism under her Holocaust-denying father, but Macron in rallies has continually described her party as the “party of hatred”.
He said she lacked any knowledge of facts and was “feeding off” French people’s unhappiness. He said she was a “parasite” on the system that she was criticising, manipulating voters’ woes. “What class!” she interjected witheringly. 
Le Pen wants a France with closed borders and to prioritise French people over foreigners for jobs, housing and benefits, to send illegal immigrants home, to turn away from the European Union and to abandon free-trade deals. She hopes to solve unemployment by blocking immigration and taxing companies who hire foreigners.
Macron wants to increase European Union cooperation and says France cannot escape the globalised world. He wants to loosen strict labour regulations and reform the eurozone with a common budget.

Similarly, what does the supreme leader mean by “community”? It appears more than 80 times in his message, so it must be important. Close reading suggests that Zuckerberg hasn’t the faintest idea of what a real community is: a social group comprising people who don’t agree on everything (think of an English village) but who have devised ways of getting along and doing what needs to be collectively done.
“The reason the idea – that community-building on a planetary scale is practicable, necessary and altogether good – did not seem ‘controversial’ in the beginning was,” observes Carr, “that Zuckerberg, like Silicon Valley in general, operated in a technological bubble, outside of politics, outside of history. Now that history has broken through the bubble and upset the algorithms, history must be put back in its place. Technological determinism must again be made synonymous with historical determinism.”
Carr is right. The best reason for reading the Zuckerberg epistle in full is that it provides the best illustration we have of the degree to which Silicon Valley has become detached from reality. En passant, it also shows how someone can be both staggeringly clever and also astonishingly naive. Facebook’s supreme leader is not an evil person. He just knows little about the world that actual human beings inhabit.
There is also, I am sorry to say, a less charitable explanation. It is that he has concluded that what is wrong with the world – all the fanaticism, cruelty, warfare, myopia and xenophobia – is because some parts of the world are not yet on Facebook. If only they were all part of that mythical “global community” then everything would be OK.

“The vow is we must never, ever allow Forest to be in this situation again,” the relieved manager, Mark Warburton, said after the game. “Can’t happen. The last five or six weeks, the relegation dogfight, it’s not what we’re about. We told the players: ‘Remember the feeling at kick‑off’, and that must never happen again.”
Before the game at the City Ground Mick McCarthy promised that he wanted to give the Ipswich fans “something to smile about” despite having nothing to play for, but one imagines not many of the travelling support came away with grins on their faces. This was not so much a bad performance as a non-performance, unable to take advantage of the inevitable nerves from a relegation-threatened side.
Forest started with some purpose, going close through a curling Jamie Ward shot in the third minute, but the nerves showed when Jordan Smith fumbled a routine cross, like a child handed a valuable vase and sternly told to absolutely, 100%, under no circumstances break it. Shortly afterwards, though, Smith made a save that Warburton described as “world-class”, tipping the ball on to the bar while changing direction after a close‑range Grant Ward shot took a deflection. Given the nerves that showed in leaden legs and confused decision-making early on, that save probably kept Forest up.
Forest still looked jittery after the break, sitting deep and with little composure to their play. But after 57 minutes they doubled the lead: David Vaughan squared to the captain, Cohen, around 25 yards out and his shot took a flick off a defender on its way to the top corner. There could not have been a more appropriate and popular scorer than the club captain, making his 300th appearance after last season returning from his third cruciate ligament injury.
Ten minutes later Forest had the chance to remove all doubt, when professional irritant Ward won another penalty, this time barged to the ground by substitute Josh Emmanuel. Assombalonga stepped up and side-footed to Bialkowski’s left but the goalkeeper produced a wonderful save to tip the ball over the bar.
No matter, though. Five minutes later Assombalonga jinked down the side of the area, was shown on to his left foot by a backtracking Luke Chambers and, accepting the invitation, launched the ball into the roof of the net with that very foot. A few moments later Vaughan, as so often Forest’s most composed character in midfield, crunched into a (fair) tackle and, for the first time in a while at the City Ground, there was a sense that everything was going to be OK.
Warburton’s thoughts have already turned to the summer and next season, with a clear idea of how he wants to shape the squad with the help of Frank McParland, the director of football he called “the best in the business”. Warburton said: “We’re not proud of being in a relegation fight. It’s a muted celebration in that respect but the job’s been done and now we can build.”
At St James’ Park, goals from Ayoze Pérez, Chancel Mbemba and the substitute Dwight Gayle secured a deserved 3-0 victory against Barnsley in front of the owner, Mike Ashley, and a crowd of 52,276 at St James’ Park, and Jack Grealish’s last-gasp equaliser for Aston Villa denied Brighton victory to allow the Magpies to leap-frog them into top spot.
Rafael Benítez, the Newcastle manager, has insisted for weeks that promotion was the only objective, but as he prepares for the talks with Ashley which will determine whether or not he remains on Tyneside he will do so with a bonus piece of silverware sitting in the trophy cabinet.
Shorn of the services of Jamaal Lascelles and the winger Matt Ritchie through suspension and injury respectively, Benítez was forced to play the midfielder Isaac Hayden in central defence, although his problems grew when the former Arsenal man had to leave the field with a head injury. As a result, the Magpies were disjointed as they set about their task with Barnsley enjoying the better of the opening 15 minutes.
However, as the midfielder Christian Atsu roused them from their slumbers, they slipped into gear and took the lead with 23 minutes gone. Jonjo Shelvey expertly clipped Aleksandar Mitrovic’s lay-off into the path of Atsu, who cut inside the full-back Callum Elder before back-heeling the ball to DeAndre Yedlin to cross for Pérez to cleverly flick home.
The Barnsley goalkeeper, Adam Davies, did well to turn Atsu’s fierce shot over the bar after the winger had tricked his way past Elder with the visitors under intense pressure, and he excelled himself a minute before the break to deny the same man as he fired hard and low towards the far post.
The substitute Massadio Haïdara blazed over from 12 yards just before the break and Pérez tested Davies seconds after it as Newcastle dominated but struggled to kill off the game. That changed when Davies dived to save Pérez’s stinging 59th-minute effort, only for Mbemba to follow up from close range and make it 2-0.
Davies was called up once again 10 minutes later to tip over Mitrovic’s header and Shelvey struck the foot of the post two minutes later, but opposite number Rob Eliot had to make late saves from substitutes Marley Watkins and Elliot Lee to preserve his clean sheet. Gayle added a third at the death and news of Villa’s equaliser sent the home fans into raptures.
The Seagulls were already promoted, ending a 34-year exile from the top flight, and victory would have seen them go up as champions but they lacked urgency and rhythm for long spells.
Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said: “Today is a negative day, it’s difficult, but there are far more pluses. What these lads have achieved this season has been magnificent. David has been excellent for us all season and he had made two very good saves from free-kicks before. There’s never any portion of blame. We have to accept it as a team.
“For us the season is finished and we have achieved our goal. We’re playing in a division where there are some very big teams, who have spent big money, and we have managed to come in the top two.”
Brighton rode their luck in the first half and Henri Lansbury wasted a glorious Villa chance as the home side finished a disappointing season 13th with the manager, Steve Bruce, needing to revamp his squad in the summer.
Villa, relegated last year, had long hoped there would be a promotion party in Birmingham but it was the visitors who were celebrating going up – even if they struggled to get going. Lansbury’s low effort was shovelled wide by Stockdale during a low key start. It was competitive enough but there was little action until Lansbury somehow managed to head wide from five yards after Sébastien Pocognoli chested the ball into his path.
Brighton seemed too relaxed over their title chase and needed Stockdale to bail them out after another Pocognoli error after 33 minutes. The on-loan West Bromwich Albion defender played a blind backpass to slip in Scott Hogan but Stockdale deflected his shot wide and the goalkeeper was then needed again to save Conor Hourihane’s free kick.
There was little on offer from Brighton and they survived a huge penalty scare five minutes after the restart when Lewis Dunk tackled Keinan Davis but the referee, Darren Bond, waved away Villa’s protests. But the visitors suddenly woke up as Murray headed wide and then Baldock forced Sam Johnstone into a smart save just before the hour. And the title swung Brighton’s way when they went ahead after 64 minutes. Murray slipped in Baldock and he managed to scuff an effort at Johnstone, only for the referee to rule Baker had fouled him before he got his shot away. The defender was sent off and Murray scored from the spot, his 23rd goal of the season.
Four minutes later Brighton should have doubled their lead when James Chester blocked Baldock’s effort following Tommy Elphick’s short backpass. But while it remained 1-0 there was always a chance the Seagulls could lose the title and Stockdale had to produce a fine stop from Hourihane’s free kick with five minutes left. However, the 31-year-old then cost his side the league title when he allowed Grealish’s low 25-yard effort to sneak in with a minute left.

The shadow chancellor said those most affected by income tax increases would be “the 1% at the top”, a figure that roughly equates to the proportion already on the highest, 45% rate, of income tax.
McDonnell was careful to avoid being too specific but when questioned he declined to rule out raising the top rate of tax to 50p, saying the party was still “consolidating and confirming our manifesto”.
McDonnell had hinted earlier in the weekend that those earning over £80,000 would be asked to pay a “modest” increase. This would effectively create a new tax bracket for those earning between £80,000 and £150,000.
Conservative sources responded by claiming that McDonnell backed an even higher tax rise, pointing to a 2012 blog in which he called for “the restoration of progressive income tax of 60% on incomes above £100,000”.
Those earning high salaries would benefit in other ways from Labour’s manifesto, he told the audience at the Museum of London. “I want to pay tribute to those who do pay their taxes at the high level,” he said. “They make their contribution and we thank them for that. At the same time, we want a fair taxation system. If we upgrade our economy, we will create a richer society.”
“I’m not working on wild hypotheticals,” he said. “I think we’ve got a period of time in which we’ve not been able to get our policies across. Partly that’s the media, I have to say. I have to be straight about that. But also we are campaigning with a united party, our campaign has got to step up a notch. The general election starts now.”
On the ground, local Labour activists opposed to Corbyn have been discreetly compiling data from voters on whether a change of leadership could persuade them to back the party. Activists in a number of areas where the Labour vote slipped in the local elections, including parts of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and West Midlands, have been asking voters “what could we change that would persuade you to vote Labour?” according to canvass returns seen by the Guardian.
Canvassers mark papers with a ‘J’ if voters suggest changing the leadership. Those who suggest the Labour leader is the problem will get call-backs from the local Labour MP to try to bring in personal votes.
Alan Johnson, a Labour former home secretary who is stepping down as an MP at the election, said Corbyn had shown he could deliver his message to “rallies to hundreds of supporters in safe Labour territory,” but had to expand this reach in the election. “Here’s a chance for him to do that and he has to grasp [it],” Johnson told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.

And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (£78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn’t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (£356m).
One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: “Why did you do it?” At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: “I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.”
Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.
He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors’s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.
Why did I do it? I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer
Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?
“There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,” he says.
Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors’s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year’s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (£10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel “sick”.
“I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,” he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.
But it didn’t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. “I didn’t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,” he says. “It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You’re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don’t get to go outside and say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’”
Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn’t really see anyone who wasn’t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn’t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.
And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company’s liking. He did as he was told.
“Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?” he writes. “Should any such line be drawn at all?” I’m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?
“I think it’s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that’s what I wish I had done much earlier,” he says. “But it’s very easy for me to say: ‘Follow your own morals and it will be fine.’ But it won’t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you’ll begin to run into trouble.” He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it’s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.
I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. “I don’t want to say,” he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned “a seven-figure sum”. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.
“You get these bonus cheques, but there’s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I’ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.” At £1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.
But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn’t perform well, and he felt short-changed.
I didn’t think about the system as a whole. You never say: ‘Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?’
“Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It’s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn’t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It’s more like you’ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.”
Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.
I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says – he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. “The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.”
But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He’s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? “I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,” he says, “but I don’t think so.” He says he couldn’t do it without becoming obsessed again.
Does he miss the money? “Of course, it’s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn’t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.”
A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: “Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn’t spend much time thinking about it – at least not until it was too late.”
“That was the only thing that I really liked,” he says now. “Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.”
I think he should stick to lecturing.
Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time – but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.
During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo Häyhä. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when Häyhä was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: “I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.” Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed “snipers”. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees – no matter what their job description is.
I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.
I wouldn’t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I would become
“Don’t worry,” I was told. “We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.” I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee’s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.
Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.

He much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches
At 67, still a man mountain at 6ft 4in, face leathery as a saddle-bag and with his latest hairpiece perfectly in place, it seemed he much preferred to chat about anything but a film that would perpetuate all the old touristy cliches from toffs in bowler hats and pub brawls to cars leaping across Tower Bridge.
Colourfully and unrestrainedly, it was “fucking” and “goddamn” this, or “shit” and “asshole” that as Wayne, one of Hollywood’s most vocal right-wingers, laid into everything and everyone from “whining radicals who call themselves liberals” and “theatre actors who couldn’t polish a bit player’s shoes” to “bank presidents and stock manipulators running studios who know nothing about motion pictures”.
To make that day even more memorable, his often gleefully intemperate tirades were constantly punctuated by painful throat-clearing and phlegmy hawking which, within minutes, had swiftly evolved into an ear-splitting series of wracking coughs and sonorous spitting (into a hanky).
Yet, as Wayne – who had bravely gone public with his lung cancer, coining the term “The Big C”, just a decade earlier – battled his turbulent throat on this warm day in summer, he never showed any obvious signs of weakening or remotely giving in as I offered the occasional, feeble, “It must be very unpleasant” or “Would you like me to leave?”
Someone once wrote: “Film stars don’t die in Liverpool.” Well, they certainly aren’t meant to peg out in Perivale, west London, either.
In fact, the wheezier he became, the more he seemed to warm to his harangues, which also included “today’s filmmakers who’d let all illusion go out the window”.
When, I asked, would he finally call it a day? “I’m gonna finish,” he declared in that famous drawl, “when they say: ‘Oh, do we have to look at that old sonofabitch again?’”
He died in 1979 after completing just two more pictures.

According to the Washington Post, its reporter’s phone was grabbed by event organisers who blocked attempts to interview investors and ordered reporters to leave. “This is not the story we want,” a PR representative was quoted as saying.
Similar events at five-star hotels were scheduled to follow in at least three other Chinese cities: Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. 
On Sunday afternoon investors were due to gather at the Four Seasons hotel in Shanghai’s glamorous former French concession, according to one Shanghai-based consultant for Qiaowai. “Invitation is free of charge,” the consultant told the Guardian. “If you offer to invest in the project, then you would sign a contract and have certain fees to pay.”
It is not clear whether Kushner’s sister will also speak at those sessions but Qiaowai’s website said a number of “VIP guests” would be present including Ben Curtiss, the vice-president of Kushner Companies. Investors would have “opportunities to speak with these distinguished guests”, Qiaowai’s website promised.

Jonny Bairstow has done all he can to nudge England towards a rethink of their plans before this summer’s Champions Trophy with his brutal exhibition of hitting and the golden arm of Joe Root setting up an 85-run win over Ireland at Lord’s.
Asked to bat under initial grey skies, England hustled their way to 328 for six with Root and Morgan striking 73 and 76 respectively in a stand of 140 before Bairstow turned on the afterburners at the back end of the innings with an unbeaten 72 from 44 balls.
Facing a target one greater than their famous chase of 328 against the same opposition in Bangalore six years ago, Ireland were bowled out for 243 in 46.1 overs as Root’s off-breaks returned three for 52 and Liam Plunkett took three for 23. Nevertheless, individuals stood up for the supportersin green, with 82 from the captain, William Porterfield, following a brawny 48 by the Middlesex opener Paul Stirling.
Stirling’s initial salvo, one of eight crunched fours and a mighty six over the ridiculously short boundary, was, truth be told, the only time England looked as if they might end up grateful for the late flourish to their own innings, where 61 runs were reaped from the final four overs as Bairstow put on something of a show for the 23,000-strong crowd.
The Yorkshireman is due to be a drinks-carrier when Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler return from the Indian Premier League to face South Africa this month before the summer’s main event. But as he mowed Ireland’s bowlers to all parts his inability to command a regular place seemed all the more baffling. At the very least the position of first reserve ahead of Sam Billings – who was given the gloves ahead of him in Buttler’s absence – has surely been locked down.
Putting on 88 in 7.4 overs with his county team-mate Adil Rashid, who wristily flicked a 25-ball 39 from No7 himself, Bairstow delivered his full repertoire, standing tall with his high backlift and manipulating boundaries through power and placement.
Bar one heart-in-the-mouth moment, when George Dockrell held him on the midwicket rope on 43 only to tumble over and throw the ball back into play, he positively glowed in the form that brought him 1,470 Test runs last year, cracking seven fours as well as three sixes.
After heads understandably dropped in the field on Friday, Ireland’s performance in the field was much sharper. Tim Murtagh got the new ball to nibble first up on his home ground, castling Alex Hales on 32 with one that seamed up the slope, while his fellow right-armer Barry McCarthy – until some late tap from Bairstow – was the pick with two for 61.
Porterfield rotated his attack throughout, making 23 bowling changes in a bid to prevent the home side settling. Settle they did, however, after Hales and Jason Roy fell in the space of three overs – the latter picking out extra cover to make it 60 for two in the 13th – with Morgan and Root then easing to half-centuries at around a run a ball when an England team of old might have consolidated.
Morgan, whose one wobble before eventually chipping McCarthy to extra cover came on 39 when a ball from Stirling’s off-spin trickled on to the stumps without disturbing them, carved the bowlers in typical fashion thereafter, while Root glossily stroked his way to a fifth 50-plus score in seven innings this year before picking out mid-off.
England struggled early in the reply – not least David Willey, who saw his three overs with the new ball crashed for 23 runs and did not return – but after Jake Ball removed Stirling in the 14th over, thanks to a faint snick behind picked up on review, the second innings belonged to Root, who bowled the full allocation for the first time in his one-day career.
Castling Ed Joyce with a sliding round-arm delivery for 16, and then getting Niall O’Brien and Gary Wilson held in the deep, Root’s form with the ball may be the best way for his fellow Yorkshireman, Bairstow, to be retained in a move that would mean England leaving Moeen Ali out as they have during this mini-series.
With Chris Woakes similarly coming back from the IPL, Plunkett made sure he will not be one to make way following a strong tour of the Caribbean in March by trapping Andy Balbirnie lbw with an 89mph delivery and persuading both Murtagh and McCarthy to pick out Ball on the rope in his second spell.
Rashid followed his five-wicket showing in Bristol by ending Kevin O’Brien’s brief repeat of his Bangalore six-hitting on 18. Mark Wood, who along with Willey endured some early butchery from Stirling, snuffed out Portferfield’s vigil when he was bowled trying a flick down leg, before completing the win by crashing a yorker into Dockrell’s stumps.

Enlightenment values – tolerance, respect for the importance of fair debate, checked and balanced government, objectivity and impartiality, recognition of international interdependencies – are being trashed. Matters could get very ugly, very fast. It is not just Europe we are leaving, but an idea of Britain.
The chill can only increase as the scale of the gulf between Britain and Europe becomes clearer. If Britain does crash out of the EU, possibly with sanctions being imposed by our former partners because we refuse to pay what they consider are our proper financial obligations, there could be a further run on sterling, a collapse in overblown property values, a second banking crisis and a deep recession. Worse, the enmity towards Europe thus provoked will poison British popular attitudes, as we suffer a lost decade or more, as our weak economy struggles to compensate for lost markets in Europe. Any deal is better than no deal.
We need our principal opposition party to force potential responses into the national conversation – federalising the constitution to avoid the risk of national break-up, rebuilding our relationship with Europe, repurposing our economy and reaffirming a new social contract. These would address the challenges in a way that inspires hope. The shrunken Labour party and its leadership’s preoccupation with yesterday’s failed leftism will be incapable of holding May to account. Or, because of the weakness of its electoral support, it has not the heft to threaten political consequences if she backs off from confronting her party’s right and its media allies.
It is a perfect storm. Corbyn must be persuaded to promise that, in the event of the likely crushing defeat, he will stand down after the election, offering Labour MPs some chance of saving themselves and their party. It is improbable. Maybe Labour will be so broken that a new party, with roots in the best of the British working class and committed to Enlightenment values that unite the best of our political traditions, will have to be started with a clean slate. It’s going to be a long hard road ahead.

Under Ireland’s Defamation Act 2009 a person who publishes or utters blasphemous material “shall be guilty of an offence”. A conviction can lead to a fine of up to €25,000.
While being interviewed on The Meaning of Life TV programme, Fry was asked what he would say to God if he had a chance.
“I’d say ‘Bone cancer in children, what’s that about?’ How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault,” Fry replied. “It’s not right. It’s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?”
Fry said if he met the Greek gods he would accept them quicker because, “they didn’t present themselves as being all seeing, all wise, all beneficent”. 
“Because the god who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish. We have to spend our lives on our knees thanking him. What kind of god would do that?”
“I told the garda I wanted to report Fry for uttering blasphemy and RTÉ for publishing/broadcasting it and that I believed these were criminal offences under the Defamation Act 2009.
“The garda then took a formal written statement from me in which I quoted Fry’s comments in detail. This written statement mentioned both Fry and RTÉ specifically.”
He said he was asked by the garda if he had been personally offended by the programme and if he wished to include this in the written statement. 
“I told the garda that I did not want to include this as I had not personally been offended by Fry’s comments – I added that I simply believed that the comments made by Fry on RTÉ were criminal blasphemy and that I was doing my civic duty by reporting a crime.”
After hearing nothing for 18 months, the complainant wrote to the head of the Irish police, Commissioner Noirín O’Sullivan, “asking if the crime I reported was being followed up. A few weeks later I got a standard ‘we have received your letter’ from her secretary.”
But recently the man was contacted by a detective from Donnybrook garda station in Dublin (the same suburb where RTÉ is headquartered) to say they were looking into the blasphemy claim. “He said he might have to meet me to take a new more detailed statement.”
“I was merely saying things that many finer heads than mine have said for hundreds of years, as far back as the Greeks ... I never wished to offend anybody who is individually devout or pious, and indeed many Christians have been in touch with me to say that they are very glad that things should be talked about.”
The host of the The Meaning Of Life programme, Gay Byrne, said “Of course [Fry] hadn’t wished to cause offence. But that’s what the internet is for, controversy, debate and people’s opinions.”

The seconds that stretch between the act of giving birth and waiting to hear a baby cry are the most harrowing moments in an otherwise privileged life. My second son, Frank, didn’t cry.
At first, still dazed from the birth, I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I remember thinking how strange it was that for hours on end all the focus had been on my body, and the monumental effort to make it do what it was supposed to, and now everything had shifted. It was like I’d been split in two and what was left of me – the remaining husk – seemed almost incidental to the scene.
I heard an alarm wailing in the corridor outside our room and I thought, vaguely, that there must be an emergency on this floor. Residents and interns in scrubs began streaming through the door, craning to see the patient – our motionless, minutes-old son. Before long there was a standing- room only crowd around the baby. My husband squeezed my hand as I processed the silent revelation that the emergency was us.
We watched the doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent as their movements became quicker. We scanned their faces for panic or relief and saw nothing, only blankness. We waited for the baby’s cry, but it never came.
Hours later, to our immense relief, we were told Frank was fine. The resident paediatrician made it clear he wasn’t concerned – or even particularly interested – in Frank’s case. He could offer no real explanation for why our son was born “flatline” (his term) apart from the obvious deduction that he’d been knocked out by the grip of the forceps on his head. “It happens,” the doctor said. “We don’t know why.” He had a touch of jaundice, but there had been no evidence of oxygen deprivation.
We watched doctors placing a toy-sized oxygen mask on our son’s face and heard them fall silent
By contrast, I was worse for wear. In addition to the forceps, I’d had internal and external tearing as well as an episiotomy – cut open and stitched back together. As one doctor later put it: “It’s like a truck drove through your pelvic floor.” I was given transfusions for blood loss and paracetamol for the pain, which didn’t help much.
When I was finally taken up to the neonatal unit in a wheelchair and able to hold him, my son was so bashed up he looked like he’d been in a bar fight. “You should see the other guy,” the nurse joked. “You already have,” I said. “The other guy is me.”
This is not the story of a personal tragedy. I’m conscious while writing this of the many mothers who have experienced far worse. Pregnancy and childbirth, when it goes wrong, can result in all manner of horrors, including the loss of a child – an experience I cannot pretend to understand.
Instead, this is a story about what’s been written out of Britain’s official birth narrative. Frank’s birth, as described, would be classified in our maternity system as a success. For a system that prides itself on being female-centred, the NHS maternity care system is failing post-natal women. Not only has the physical and mental health of new mothers become secondary, it sometimes seems inconsequential. This is the untold story of the suffering our maternity care system ignores.
It’s difficult to admit this now, eight months after Frank’s birth, but in those first weeks I did not feel the exhilaration that comes with a baby. I cared for my son dutifully, feeding, bathing, burping, swaddling, soothing him through the night, but much of the time I felt weirdly detached, like a zombie shuffling through the motions.
The sound of his cry induced black thoughts, a darkening of my already dull mood. I remember looking at him and registering the fact he was beautiful, but being unable separate his body from the horror of his birth. I obsessed over the idea that something was wrong with him, that he’d been deprived of oxygen and the doctors had hidden it from me. I took him to see the community midwife twice because I was convinced his eyes were crossed. When I demanded to know if the midwife thought he looked like he had brain damage she looked at me oddly.
In those first few weeks I had flashbacks every day. I’d be standing in the queue at Sainsbury’s and suddenly I’d be back in the madness of the delivery room, blood pooling on the floor beneath my bed wondering if my baby was dead. I ruminated over the details of what happened for weeks, unable to think about little else. Some days I told the story to anyone who would listen; others I could barely speak at all. Finally I went to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with trauma. Not post-partum depression – she was very clear on this point – but post-traumatic stress, as a result of the physical and emotional ordeal of Frank’s birth.
Physically I was also struggling. As Frank grew bigger and bonnier, lighting up the world with his first gummy grins, I wasn’t bouncing back. Every time I found myself alone in the room with a doctor, health visitor or community midwife I’d demand they examine me to determine whether or not I was healing properly. Again and again I was told everything looked fine – the stitches had healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss.
The stitches healed and I was given the all clear for exercise, for sex, for life. But something was amiss
This is not as fun as it sounds.
In spite of all this, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most women who experience birth injury and trauma never get properly diagnosed or treated. It’s hard even to get any one to recognise there might be a problem. My husband, astonished there was no routine follow up for me after such a traumatic birth, tracked down the obstetrician who’d delivered Frank to seek guidance from her. She did not respond. We found out later this sort of contact is not encouraged; no comment or advice could be offered. A hospital collectively delivers.
It’s obvious that childbirth is deeply traumatic for many women’s minds and bodies. Just over a century ago almost 7% of pregnant women in England and Wales died from it. But birth is much safer now – so why are so many women still suffering its after-effects undiagnosed and untreated?
Part of the reason is that the conversation around birth trauma and injury is steeped in shame and institutional sexism. I’m not just talking about the general prudishness surrounding women’s reproductive health issues. There is a prevailing attitude I encountered among many health professionals which is that new mothers should basically learn to suck it up. As one GP said to me in semi-exasperation: “You’ve had two children. Your body’s changed. You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before.”
The attitude is new mothers should just suck it up. One GP said: ‘You can’t expect to feel the same as you did before’
Part of the problem, I have come to believe, is that pregnant women are not properly informed of the risks of birth trauma and injury in advance.
With my first pregnancy I was determined to have an all-natural, drug-free, at-home water birth. I rented a birth pool at the urging of my NHS homebirth midwife and when labour began I went around the house lighting scented candles. But seven hours in, when my baby turned out to be an undetected breech, I was rushed to hospital in a wailing ambulance. Once it was determined my son would be born via emergency caesarean, a doctor talked me through all the risks in advance and asked me to sign a surgical waiver. And yet, with my second son, when I waived my right to an elective C-section and opted instead for a “normal” birth, I was assured by several midwives that opting for a VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean) was the safer, better option and would result in an easier recovery than a surgical birth.
To get state-funded care, you have to fight for it, which many birth-injured and traumatised new mothers are in no state to do. Complicating matters further is the issue of post-partum depression. Just look at the postnatal chat groups online and you will find women frustrated at being told they simply have a hormonally induced case of “baby blues” when what they’re actually feeling is a normal reaction to a profoundly distressing experience. Diagnosing a birth-injured or traumatised mother with post-partum depression is the healthcare equivalent of asking a justifiably irate woman if maybe, just maybe, she’s about to get her period? And yet it happens all the time.
There is a reasonable explanation for this apparent state of institutional denial. Birth trauma and injury conflict with the NHS’s dominant maternity care ethos, that “natural” births are safer and more empowering for women. This despite the fact that the UK has one of the highest infant morality rates in western Europe and, according to the NHS litigation authority, pays out hundreds of millions in maternity negligence claims each year.
According to Treadwell, birth trauma is exacerbated by a culture that celebrates only one kind of birth. “The system, as well as the dominant culture, fills women with false expectations. It deludes women into thinking that birth ought to be this wonderful, empowering experience and when it isn’t women feel terribly ashamed.”
Last year when Jamie and Jools Oliver had their fifth child, Oliver tweeted about his wife’s “unbelievably composed natural birth”. It sounds ridiculous, but I cried reading that tweet. New mothers are deeply susceptible to guilt and it often begins with not having performed birth in the circumscribed way.
Eight months on, Frank and I are muddling along in an exhausted state of contentment. The trauma of his birth is fading, superseded each passing day with the marvellous reality of him. My body is now the body of a mother – battle-worn, cosy and intimidating in its accomplishments. I am grateful for my boys and for the fact that I got help for a condition many mothers experience but for which few ever seek acknowledgement, let alone treatment.
Like I said, I’m one of the lucky ones.

I’m a sucker for the American west as seen from a bus and I loved the wild, magical, almost mystical portrayal of the landscape in this coming-of-age road movie by Andrea Arnold. I also loved the tender relationship between the main character, who has run away to join a circus-like group of teenage sales people in the US, and the animals she keeps trying to save. Her familiar longing to save these little creatures from an unpredictable world is almost godlike and echoes the viewer’s desire to see her and her young friends safely delivered to a better future.
Sorry to choose a reissue for the music choice. I have to admit that at some point, I think my late 30s, I decided I had enough music to last me a lifetime and stopped being hungry for new stuff. Music still feels like a lifeline to me but like most other middle aged people, I’d rather listen to music I’m already familiar with. When I left London, I gave away or sold my record collection, most of which was covered in candle wax and jam. I still find it thrilling and the greatest possible luxury to be carrying around all my music in my pocket and be able to find whatever I’m looking for within moments. But I digress. I chose this album because it’s just been rereleased and so counts as something sort-of new. I completely missed Elliott Smith the first time round, I’m not sure how, and was introduced to this album by my husband. It’s now one of my all-time favourites – it’s start-to-finish absolute perfection. I don’t have much tolerance for sad music, but this is gentle and smart and somehow weirdly comforting, and it’s not depressing at all.
I’m so ashamed that I bought the lie that Bernie had no chance of being elected if he won the Democratic nomination. Looking back, I think that was totally wrong. I’ve been ignoring American politics since I’ve lived here, partly because the system seems so messed up and partly because I believed Obama was genuinely a good guy and if he couldn’t do it, it couldn’t be done. Reading this book was a huge eye-opener. I’ve also woken up to the fact that I need to start paying attention and doing what I can. I was just in South Carolina with a friend, helping to register voters for the special election there in June. I hope the extremity of what is happening in the US now gives birth to a truly progressive revolution. The Women’s March was incredible and it’s been heartening to see how many grassroots campaigns are springing up.
Ram Dass was a big-shot Harvard psychology professor in the 60s [under the name Richard Alpert], until he found himself in the office next door to Timothy Leary, which led to drinking the Kool Aid and getting himself very publicly dismissed. In an effort to find a more sustainable high, and to seek the origin of the truth he had glimpsed while taking psychedelics, he traveled to India and found his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. He came back to the US and became one of the archetypal 60s spiritual teachers who spread the teachings of the east to the west. He’s funny and wise and I love him. This book is a recently compiled collection of his writings. Ram Dass is in his eighties now and has lost the ability to speak fluently after suffering a stroke, so this book is read by his pal Rameshwar Das, who does a great job.

Le Pen says she's not 'against immigrants, just against immigration' – it's like being against juggling but not jugglers
And what of her opponent? For Le Pen, Macron represents “a morbid continuity, littered with the corpses of jobs transferred offshore, the ruins of bust businesses, and the gaping holes of deficit and debt”. (Such apocalyptic metaphors of death and decay are, it must be admitted, very fascist.) Macron himself is having none of it. Le Pen, he says, is “a threat to democracy” who propagates “dangerous untruths”; she leads a party that still promotes “hatred” and is against “liberty”. It’s promising the people “presents”, but they are “lies” that the party could never finance. (One thinks mildly here of £350m a week for the NHS.)
So will the French vote for the people, the Republic, la France, or something else? The Front National, Macron warned this week, is actually “the anti-France party” – an interesting choice of words, given that the phrase “anti-France” was first coined by the French far right who imagined Jewish conspiracies at the end of the 19th century. The civilised choice is clear, but when each side accuses the other of being the enemy of the people, one may forgive the people for thinking they don’t have many friends left in high places.

She now has the right to live and work in the UK permanently after Brexit, irrespective of the outcome of negotiations between Brussels and London. 
She swore allegiance to the Queen and completed a “life in the UK” test to prove she was assimilating into British culture, even though she is bilingual, has lived in the country for most of her adult life and is married to a British man with whom she has two British children.
Hawkins, like other EU nationals receiving British citizenship, was handed a standard letter from the home secretary congratulating her on her new status. In a sign of the struggle the Home Office is facing dealing with the volume of applications from EU citizens, the letter was signed by Theresa May, who stepped down as home secretary when she became prime minister almost a year ago.
“I am delighted to finally be British, having felt part of this wonderful and beautiful country for many years now,” said Hawkins. “The ceremony was quick, it felt odd. I have very mixed emotions about it.”
It was a bittersweet moment for the IT consultant. She no longer has to worry about her status post-Brexit but, on the downside, she has learned that she has lost several rights conferred under EU freedom of movement laws.
“Some time after submitting my application in January, I was horrified to learn from a lawyer that in fact by becoming a dual-national British citizen, I have signed away several rights that I had before,” she said. 
The first thing Hawkins did following the citizenship ceremony was register to vote in the general election, something that EU citizens are not eligible to do, bar the Irish, Maltese and citizens of the Republic of Cyprus. She said she was “especially pleased” to be able to vote in an election that would affect the future of the three million EU citizens living in the UK.
She said she was concerned about other EU citizens who, after the referendum, discovered they were not entitled to be here because they were caring for a disabled child; were stay-at-home parents; or students who were not notified by the Home Office or their universities that they were required to have private health insurance to stay. “These are the people I worry about, that is what keeps me awake at night,” Hawkins said. 
 She has been asked to speak at at an event organised by the Dutch MEP Sophie in ’t Veld, who set up the parliament’s task force in January to look into the rights of people and families affected by Brexit.
Last December, Hawkins described her treatment by the Home Office as being as “absurd as a Monty Python sketch”.
She had sent officials an 85-page permanent residency application along with documents such as historic employment records, council tax statements and proof of absences from the country. However, the Home Office refused her application on the grounds that she had sent in a notarised copy of her passport rather than her original, which she needed for travelling to the Netherlands to handle the paperwork generated by the death of her father.
“As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom, you should now make arrangements to leave,” the rejection letter stated.

The president used his favorite bullhorn, Twitter, on Sunday to begin the lengthy process of browbeating wavering Republican senators into line. “Republican Senators will not let the American people down!” he said.
Republican Senators will not let the American people down! ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up - it was a lie and it is dead!
His chief of staff, Reince Priebus, signaled that a more dignified pace of debate might be tolerated in the Senate, in contrast with the unseemly haste of the House. “Everyone is excited and ready to go to work and take the time necessary to look at the bill … No one’s going to be beating down their door,” he said on Fox News Sunday.
But there were already alarming signs for the White House of a groundswell of discontent among moderates that presages a stormy ride in the Senate. Susan Collins, the senator from Maine who is an expert on healthcare, vowed to effectively bin the House bill and start all over again.
Making a veiled dig at the breakneck speed of the passage through the House, she told ABC’s This Week: “The Senate is starting from scratch. We are going to draft our own bill and I am convinced we are going to take the time to do it right. We will come up with a whole new approach.”
John Kasich, the governor of Ohio who sought the Republican nomination for president, sounded the alarm over the plan to rein back Medicaid expansion. He said that could impact 700,000 people in his state, a third of whom have mental illnesses or experience drug addiction.
“What happens to those people?” he asked on CNN’s State of the Union. “They give you a $3,000 or $4,000 tax credit to buy insurance. What do you think they can buy for that?”
Kasich also raised the other knotty problem that is causing divisions within the Republican party: pre-existing conditions. He was derisive about the $8bn subsidy allowed under the House bill to help set up “high-risk pools” to insure people with pre-existing medical conditions in states that opt to allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums to such individuals.
“These high-risk pools, they aren’t funded,” Kasich said, “$8bn is not enough. It’s ridiculous. States are not going to opt for that.”
Trump’s health and human services secretary, Tom Price, side-stepped questions over cuts to Medicaid and cover for pre-existing conditions. He stuck to his official line, telling CNN “the winners under Obamacare were the federal government and insurance companies, the winners under the program we provide will be patients and families and doctors”.
Underlying the increasingly bitter fight are concerns that if the legislation ends up hurting millions of Americans the party could itself be punished. 
As Republican leaders downplayed the threat of a rout in 2018, Priebus, a former chair of the Republican National Committee, went so far as to suggest that voters would thank his party.
The electorate, he said, would “reward the Republicans that sat up and said, ‘We are not going to see the Obamacare system, which is failing and collapsing, continue any longer.”
The speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who was instrumental in ramming the legislation through, called the bill a “rescue mission”. He told ABC: “We are proud of this effort, it’s us keeping our promises and it’s a lot better than Obamacare.”
After the comment, his audience erupted in jeers and boos.

At least the ensuing war of words and public emotion shows that both sides realise just how much is at stake. The truth is that the upcoming negotiations will be incredibly complicated, for both technical and political reasons.
For example, how can we deal with the land border in Ireland? The new arrangements will have major implications for business and trade but also for the hundreds of thousands of people in the north with a passport from the republic. Nearly 20,000 workers commute across the border. These are not technical issues but questions with far-reaching political consequences, including for the peace process.
And Northern Ireland is only one of many such issues, where technical complexity meets political tension. Perhaps most important is the need to reach a deal that defines the rights of expats on both sides. But which rights should these migrants keep? A British citizen living in Spain currently has the right to vote in local elections. Should this be preserved? What about the French student who pays domestic rates at a London university? And how do we process the pension rights accrued by a Polish worker who spends six years in the UK but then leaves? The EU has mechanisms for these situations, and lives were planned around the existing rules.
Whatever the agreement on citizens’ rights, they must be enforceable and protected. So who will watch over them, and what will be the relevant jurisdiction? Theresa May talks of escaping oversight by the European court of justice (ECJ), while the EU wants the ECJ to adjudicate. All of these questions are technically fraught and politically charged, but both sides have repeatedly insisted that citizens’ rights are a priority. So now they must deliver. The UK and European public rightly expect politicians to sort out the mess and minimise the damage to people’s lives.
A second issue is future trade relationships. On a technical level, this should actually be easy to agree. We are not talking about a trade deal between two vastly different economies: on the contrary, the Great Repeal Act will translate the current body of EU law into British law. Thus, on the day of Brexit, standards and regulations will essentially be identical. The questions here are whether either side imposes tariffs, and how to deal with future regulatory divergence. These are standard topics, often negotiated in trade agreements, and they are less complex than the fine detail of migrant citizens’ lives.
With political will, a sensible trade agreement is in reach. A deal that primarily covers goods, rather than investment and services, could easily be passed on the EU side. More elaborate agreements would require unanimity, and the recent near-collapse of the EU-Canada Ceta agreement shows that this can be tricky to achieve. But still, it is in both sides’ interest to avoid a no-deal scenario and a fallback to WTO rules.
A final big issue is the infamous “Brexit bill”. Although economically insignificant, politically this might be the most toxic issue. It is important to understand that even a sum of €60bn would not be at all threatening to the UK’s economic fortunes – it is around 3% of UK GDP, and it would be spread over a number of years. But for politicians the bill is extremely explosive, mostly because of the emotional headlines it will trigger on both sides.
After Brexit, economic and political links between the EU and the UK will be weaker. But the UK will still be the EU’s closest neighbour and an important ally. It is time to discuss in earnest how to soften the damage of Brexit for citizens and business on both sides. And it is time to explore how to structure future cooperation in fighting terrorism. Brexit will not be a success, but aiming for failure serves no one. Goodwill and a sense of perspective are the way to protect the EU and UK alike.

Look at a map of the country and you can see how our old cities were built around rivers, back when people used them daily as a source of water or trade, or for sewage. Today, we rely on them less – but they still play a vital part in British life, and hide some fascinating stories. Here are just a few of the most interesting things about them.
In 1909, the Gloucester and Sharpness canal was in danger. The nearby river Severn was widening day by day and threatened to spill over into the neighbouring waterway. Something had to be done urgently, so the canal company had the idea of killing two birds with one stone. They would shore up the riverbank and decommission some old boats at the same time, by beaching them where the land was thinnest.
 In so doing, they created a unique mausoleum of British nautical history. Barges, schooners and trows – cargo boats with masts that could be taken down to go under bridges – continued to be added until the 1970s, including the Catherine Ellen, a two-masted schooner that had been involved in the Irish War of Independence, and the two barges that caused the 1960 Severn Railway Bridge disaster, when five men lost their lives.
The Avon comes from the Celtic “abona”, via the Welsh “afon”, which just means “river”. As a result, there are eight Avons in England and Scotland, and even an afon Afan in Wales. In the same way, both the Wye and the Wey, a tributary of the Thames, seem to derive from Celtic “weg”, meaning “flowing water”. Thankfully our forebears found time for a double bluff now and then. It makes sense that Cambridge should be the name of the city that straddles the river Cam, but in fact it worked the other way round. Originally called the Granta, on which the city of Grantebrycge was founded, the river changed its name after the city did.
The stretch of the Thames between Kingston and Oxford is one of the most famous sections of river anywhere in the world. This is not because many celebrities have mansions there, although many do – including George and Amal Clooney – but because this was the section travelled by Jerome K Jerome and his friends George Wingrave and Cart Hentschel in a series of short holidays, which became the basis for one of the world’s most uneven yet greatest comic novels, Three Men in a Boat (1889). Though the book may seem like a self-deprecating love letter from the English to themselves, it sold more than a million (mostly bootleg) copies in the US, was a huge hit in Germany and Russia, and has been translated into virtually every language that exists in print. Retracing the route in the story is a popular pilgrimage with fans, not least because the towns and even many of the pubs that Jerome writes about are still there.
Or a percentage of your home at any rate, through one of the country’s 200 or so hydroelectric power stations. To fill you in, hydroelectricity was one of the first forms of renewable power to be generated in Britain, or indeed anywhere. In fact its roots are ancient, since these plants are essentially just grand water wheels, which make water turn a turbine as it flows downhill. This is usually done by damming a river and controlling the flow. Britain’s hydroelectric plants, most of them in Wales and Scotland, supply 1-2% of the country’s electricity, though there is scope to build more. They are especially useful because they can be turned on and off fairly easily according to demand, unlike wind and solar.
The Canal & River Trust cares for 2,000 miles of waterways across England and Wales. It’s a fascinating network full of life, that’s free and open to all, and where there’s something for everyone – whether you are walking your dog, having a family day out or simply want a moment to yourself.

The uncertainty stemmed from India’s evident dissatisfaction with the new power and revenue-sharing model agreed by the International Cricket Council last month. But in a short statement attributed to the BCCI secretary, Amitabh Choudhary, those fears were allayed – and India will therefore defend the trophy they won four years ago, also in England.
India missed the initial deadline of 25 April to name their squad – a date met by all other participating nations – but will face no sanction for the delay. Further discussions are, however, in the offing over India’s response to the ICC’s policy change before it is adopted at the world governing body’s annual conference next month.
The BCCI added in its statement: “The board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI, while keeping its legal options open.”

Cleaning up all that was straightforward: turn the machine down to 30C and use an eco detergent.
In terms of plastic fibre volume, a city the size of Berlin may be responsible for releasing the equivalent of 540,000 plastic bags’ worth of them into the ocean daily.
That sounds overwhelming, but the more natural fibres you wear (such as cotton), the better. Frequently washed items should be non-synthetic where possible.
With the rise of the clean beauty movement it can be difficult navigating the plethora of products out there that claim to be natural and organic.
Green People, celebrating 20 years in the business, is the real deal. This is the brand that defined what it means to be organic.
Back in 1999, founder Charlotte Vøhtz, was invited to be on a committee for the Soil Association (the UK body with the most stringent organic certification) to design the first standards for organic beauty.
Vøhtz’s drive to create her truly organic skincare range began when her young daughter Sandra was battling multiple skin allergies and eczema. Now her brand offers 160 sustainable skin and hair products (including two special anniversary ranges), but nothing that has been diluted or bulked out with high levels of water, drying alcohol or synthetic fillers.

Hargreaves, who is now retired after founding the Hargreaves Lansdown financial services company, said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of EU nationals before the delicate negotiations over Brexit. However, he said, May should simply “make the gesture” and not wait until Brussels agreed to do the same for UK nationals living in EU states.
It coincides with concern among some senior Brexit backers over May’s approach to immigration after Brexit.
Hargreaves said he was happy to see EU nationals already here maintain their current rights. “Most of those are in work and adding to our economy,” he said. “We are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future, but I think there should have been that comfort given, because they came under different circumstances.”
Wolfson said: “While it is important and essential that Britain controls who comes into this country, and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers … it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge.
“We are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war. If we are too draconian on immigration, it will have two adverse effects on our economy. The first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth, and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world.
“The most important thing to come out of Brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world – that Britain is an open country, a free trading country, one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it.”
Marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures, arguing that universities “must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post-Brexit economy”.
“It is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no-brainer to take students out of the migration numbers,” he said.
“Polling of Brexit voters even shows strong support for this change. People in the north and Midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector. They are simply not worried about student migration.”

Do they kiss their mommas with those mouths? When interviewed, marchers said that Trump was an “embarrassment” and “unwelcome”. In the end, Trump completed his official engagement and veered back to his New Jersey golf course without even popping in to Trump Tower to see if he could find which cupboard Melania had frantically hidden in this time.
What’s the betting that Trump was sitting in the back of his car pulling his maddest, crossest presidential face – you know, the one that makes him resemble Mount Rushmore before the stonemasons started work?
Only recently, Trump was hinting that being the leader of the free world wasn’t all it was cracked up to be and now this happens.
The people of New York need to take a long hard look at themselves. Anyone would think that the only way that they’d want Trump to take another bite of the Big Apple would be if he instantly choked on it and they got to watch.

Picking up on the same theme, Farage tweeted: “A giant deceit has been voted for today. Macron will be Juncker’s puppet.”
As well as praising Le Pen in recent weeks, Farage declared in a TV interview on Sunday morning that the 48-year-old had “lost weight” and was “looking pretty fit”. 
Katie Hopkins tweeted a picture of the pair and the caption: “Macron’s wife has promised him a special new toy from the shops tomorrow for being such a clever little boy.”
Echoing a line used by Le Pen in a televised debate with Macron on Thursday, Simon Richards, the CEO of the libertarian group the Freedom Association, said: “Macron evidently likes older women, so he’ll make an excellent lapdog for Angela Merkel.”

What is it about Italian coaches? Certainly, Serie A offers them the comprehensive grounding. Paul Pogba, the Manchester United midfielder, who spent four seasons at Juventus, described Italy’s top division as “the university of football, especially at a tactical level”. Then, there is Coverciano, the Italian Football Federation’s acclaimed technical centre and finishing school for managers.
“There is a good school in Italy but, honestly, when you arrive in England and you face this league, you must change your mind on a lot of things,” Conte says. “You must adapt very well and very quickly to this league. It is very difficult, very strong and it’s totally different to the Italian or Spanish leagues.
“In every single game, you must fight a lot. You must put all of yourself into every game and if you think you’re playing a team at a medium level you’re actually preparing for a defeat. For this reason it’s not easy [for an English team] to reach the end of a European competition. Also, for the national team, it’s very difficult to do very well in the World Cup or the Euros because you arrive at the end of the season and the players are tired.”
That is for the summer. For now, Conte is consumed by Middlesbrough and the final title push. It stands to lead him into elite company. “For sure, I looked at the past in England and I saw many Italian managers had won the title,” he says. “It’s great for our school and it’s logical to be proud, no? Last season, I supported Claudio Ranieri a lot to win the title and in Italy we celebrated this win in a great way.”

It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened
But it’s Monday morning, he’s just woken up, and he’s in no mood to enter that headspace. When I remark that the album has more darkness and meditations on mortality, he yawns and says, “Maybe, I dunno. Maybe I was just being a jackass.” Has he picked up any adult life skills recently? “Uh I don’t think I have very many… fuck. Ummm. I learned how to wipe my own ass last week,” he guffaws (the joke is later reprised several times). His preferred way of starting an answer is “I dunno”.
Two sides coexist in the DeMarco universe: one laid-back and sunny, one more introspective. A casual listen to the album doesn’t immediately reveal the ruminations within: the music sounds upbeat and melodic, there are odes to love (inspired by his long-term girlfriend), guitars twang serenely. Yet, DeMarco’s father looms large throughout. In opener My Old Man, DeMarco sings about becoming more like his father – “Uh-oh, looks like I’m seeing more of my old man in me” – a relatable-enough sentiment, made more touching by the knowledge that his father is an alcoholic and an addict whom he hardly knows.
Nevertheless, he warns against taking this too literally. “Anytime I see myself becoming something that I don’t necessarily agree with, that’s kind of what I’m talking about there, I guess,” he says. “But that can be taken in several different ways. Take it like a trope or whatever. It doesn’t matter – it’s a pop song.”
The album was written months ago, when his father had become very ill: the last song goes: “The thought of him no longer being around / Well sure it would be sad but not really different / And even though we barely know each other / It still hurts watching him fade away.” Although his father’s health has now improved, the two are still not in touch. Did exploring these issues on the album change the way he views his father? “Um, no. I mean, I was trying to understand it. But I don’t know, I really don’t. It just solidified [the fact] that I don’t understand.”
A much happier relationship is with his girlfriend, Kiera McNally. They met aged 14, got together five years later, and are still together seven years on (“almost eight”, she chirps in the background). The album’s love songs are varied – some are about past fights (“I never meant to make her cry”), some about fluctuations of affection (“sometimes my heart may seem awful cold”), one harks back to the feeling of “seeing her for the first time”, others are inspired by emotions from the distant past.
Considering that a lot of music is about break-ups or falling in love, is it harder to find inspiration in a contented, settled relationship? “It still comes,” he says. “I think that just being in love – being out of love, being in love, being confused by love, wanting love, not wanting love, being scared of love – it doesn’t matter which. There are so many things better than feeling nothing at all. Long-term relationships are like a fucking mountainscape, you know? Things go up, things go down. That’s the fun of it.” What’s his top relationship advice? “Be kind. Be respectful. And be real.”
DeMarco has always railed against the “cool guy fantasy” of rock stars being separate from fans: “the idea of that sexy guy in the band, dark and tall and handsome, looking at his shoes like, ‘Don’t talk to me’ – that has been so unappealing to me for ever.” Most of the fans he encounters are excitable young kids, with the occasional surprise. “It’s always weird when someone takes their pants down and has a drawing of me tattooed on their butt. That’s happened a couple times.”
But he also likes to throw curveballs about his life into the mix: he told one interviewer that Kiera has sadly passed away; he informed an audience they had broken up. Recently he said in an interview that he had become a father, prompting family members to get in touch to congratulate him; his mother said it almost gave her a heart attack. “The whole thing with the internet,” he says with a groan, “it’s the wild west. People read into things too much – it’s all horseshit and I like to treat it that way and have fun with it.”
I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth – it’s so twisted
He’s unlikely to repeat the experiment in his new place. He has just bought his first house, which made him feel “kind of weird and old”, after moving from New York to Los Angeles last August (“No real reason why – it just seemed a happening place, so it was like, ‘let’s go give it a shot’”). Now that he’s in LA, has he started to see the appeal of yoga and juice cleanses? “Nah, I don’t think so. I don’t like a juice, I like a smoothie, I like the chunkiness – a smoothie is halfway to a milkshake, and I’d have milkshakes every day if I could.”
It isn’t easy to get a strong opinion out of DeMarco, prime purveyor of contemporary slacker rock (in terms of sound rather than work ethic). What makes him angry? “I don’t get genuinely angry very easily. I don’t know. A whole number of different things. It’s hard to pinpoint what.” I try to stir him up a little. What does he think of life under Trump? “A lot of people are really put out, sad, disappointed… but I dunno. It’s not that it’s not my place to talk about American politics, but it’s a little complicated.” How worried is he about nuclear war? “If we got nuked I’d probably be fried before I even noticed it, which would suck, but would I know? Hopefully nuclear war doesn’t happen, that would really blow ass.”
How does he feel about social media? “It’s bizarre, but I understand how fucked up the youth is now, where your online life is equal to your self-worth. Kids have been led to believe that the number of likes you get on a post or something is equal to your popularity or how cool you are – it’s so twisted and evil. It’s really fucked up and scary, and it’s getting scarier.” He does have Twitter and Instagram accounts but rarely touches them; one of his most recent tweets, from last October, simply reads “#jarjarbinks”.
Social media has also meant that footage of his wilder live shows – nudity, drinking, a notorious incident involving a drumstick – live on online. “When those kinds of things happen it’s usually because I’ve had an off show,” he says. “What I try to focus on is try and play as well as I can and make sure everybody’s happy.”
Until then, does he have any pearls of wisdom to impart? “Nah, I’m good,” he says. “Just tell everybody to brush their teeth twice a day – keep it fresh.”
Mac DeMarco’s album This Old Dog is out now on Captured Tracks. He plays two sold-out nights at the O2 Academy Brixton, London SW9, on 30 and 31 May

The author also said Donald Trump “sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m”.
“Trump was strutting up and down, talking to his new members about how they were part of the greatest club in North Carolina,” Dodson said. “And when I first met him, I asked him … you know, this is the journalist in me … I said, ‘What are you using to pay for these courses?’ And he just sort of tossed off that he had access to $100m.”
Eric Trump, the president’s younger son who is now executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, was also present.
Dodson continued: “So when I got in the cart with Eric, as we were setting off [to play], I said, ‘Eric, who’s funding? I know no banks – because of the recession, the great recession – have touched a golf course. You know, no one’s funding any kind of golf construction. It’s dead in the water the last four or five years.’ 
He said, ‘Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia'
“Now that was three years ago, so it was pretty interesting.”
He also said: “And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”
Dodson, meanwhile, recounted a meal of cheeseburgers and being enveloped in a “bro hug” by Trump, and said: “You know, I liked the guy. I liked him. I mean, he was somebody you’d like to play golf with.”
“And I told Arnold that the next night at dinner and he laughed and said, ‘Really, Shakespeare? It’s more like this.’ And he crossed his hands and put them at his own throat.”

The three-time Olympian, three-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champion was 37.
“The only reason why the USA is in any conversation in the sport of bobsled is because of Steve Holcomb,” said US bobsled pilot Nick Cunningham, who roomed next to Holcomb in Lake Placid. “He was the face of our team. He was the face of our sport. We all emulated him. Every driver in the world watched him, because he was that good at what he did. It’s a huge loss, huge loss, not just for our team but for the entire bobsled community.”
No cause of death was immediately announced, but officials said there were no indications of foul play after the preliminary parts of an ongoing investigation were completed. USA Bobsled and Skeleton said it was believed Holcomb died in his sleep.
An autopsy was scheduled for Sunday. Funeral arrangements are expected to be finalized in the coming days.
“USA Bobsled and Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend,” federation CEO Darrin Steele said.
Holcomb was a native of Park City, Utah, and his signature moment came at the 2010 Vancouver games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold medal drought for the US in bobsled’s signature race.
“The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb,” US Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said. “Steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, and his perseverance and achievements were an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve’s family and the entire bobsledding community.”
Holcomb was still one of the world’s elite drivers, finishing second on the World Cup circuit in two-man points and third in four-man points this past season.
The final victory of his career was last December in Lake Placid. He won 60 World Cup medals in his career, 10 more at the world championships and three in the Olympics, making him one of the most decorated pilots in the world.
“You will be loved, missed and remembered forever,” US women’s pilot Jamie Greubel Poser wrote on Twitter.
Holcomb was an Eagle Scout and served as both a member of the Utah Army National Guard and the Army World Class Athlete Program. He was cherubic, almost always happy in public, someone whose sense of humor was well-known throughout the close-knit bobsled world. Teammates even spent a season chronicling his “Holcy Dance,” a little less-than-rhythmic shuffle that he would do at each stop on the World Cup circuit to make fellow sliders laugh.
But there was also a troubled side, including battles with depression and alcohol, plus a failed hotel-room suicide attempt involving sleeping pills in 2007 which he wrote about in his autobiography, But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold.
“After going through all that and still being here, I realized what my purpose was,” Holcomb said in a 2014 interview.
Winning gold with push athletes Steve Mesler, Curt Tomasevicz and Justin Olsen at the Vancouver Olympics turned Holcomb into a full-fledged star. In the months that followed, Holcomb met President Barack Obama, played golf with Charles Barkley, hung out with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Cleveland Indians game and went to the Indianapolis 500.
In the bobsled world, he was larger than life. “We’re all still in shock,” Cunningham said. “I don’t know if mourning will happen for a long time, because the shock part will take a while.”

Picked up in Red Cross vehicles and given the agency’s branded T-shirts to wear, the young women boarded military helicopters and were flown to the capital, Abuja, to meet the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, as anxious families awaited an official list of the names of those released. Information was given out gradually: by mid-afternoon, only 20 names had been published.
Buhari, who has not been seen in public for several weeks because of illness, later flew to London for medical checkups. His departure had been delayed so he could meet the Chibok women, according to his office.
“Boko Haram members have executed and tortured thousands of civilians and raped and forced into marriage girls and women. They have been indoctrinated and even forced to fight for Boko Haram. The Nigerian authorities must now do more to ensure the safe return of the thousands of women and girls, as well as men and boys abducted by Boko Haram.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told the Guardian that it had acted as a neutral intermediary and organised the transportation of the girls and young women to freedom. “We were not involved in the negotiations for their release, as negotiations often imply a political process which is contrary to the apolitical-neutral nature of the ICRC’s work,” said a spokeswoman. “Therefore we cannot make comments on the conditions agreed by the parties for their release [or] whether there are more so-called Chibok girls in the hands of the armed opposition.”
The freed captives were expected to be reunited with their families on Sunday, she added.
Lengthy negotiations took place in Switzerland and Sudan, according to Shehu Sani, a Nigerian senator, though he added that the Boko Haram representatives did not attend those in Bern. Sani told the Guardian that it was he who introduced Zanna, the chief negotiator, to the government and came up with a road map for the talks.
Two of the 82 girls were physically injured, Sani said. One had a wrist injury and the other was on crutches.
Asked whether the five commanders could strengthen Boko Haram, analyst Ryan Cummings thought not. “I doubt it very much. Boko Haram is massively decentralised and is more an umbrella movement than a monolithic movement. Commanders could have a localised impact in areas that they return to but it will have no wider impact,” he said.
Since the Chibok abduction, Boko Haram has splintered into different factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
An unnamed Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation told Associated Press (AP) the women were found near Banki, a town close to the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram remains active in the area, despite claims by Buhari that the militant group has been crushed and forced from its last forest hideout.
