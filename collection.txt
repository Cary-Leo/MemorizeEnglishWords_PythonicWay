Matus and DeVoursney, a former Marine from Georgia, were found dead Monday in Belize. Authorities in the Central American country have named 54-year-old John Deshaies as the prime suspect.
But the friend of the suspected killer says police have the wrong man. The friend said Deshaies, the owner of a Canadian construction company, would never harm Matus.
The friend believes police targeted Deshaies because he left the country shortly after Matus and DeVoursney went missing.
Deshaies lived in the lower half of Matus' home in Belize. Matus, 52, was a Canadian real estate investor and split her time between Belize and Canada.
"Belize is a very corrupt country," the friend said. "I think they're actually keeping him in jail for his own safety. They want it to seem like it's a Canadian or American problem rather than a Belizean one."
DeVoursney, 36, and Matus, who had only been dating for a few months, were last seen alive at Scotty's Bar and Grill in Corozal. They were found dead in a field near the village of Chan Chen a week after they disappeared.
It was determined that Matus and DeVoursney had been strangled.

May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. bobsledder Steven Holcomb, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead at a training site on Saturday, the U.S. Olympic Committee said.
Holcomb, 37, was discovered in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York, the committee said in a statement. It gave no further details.
Holcomb, who underwent successful surgery in 2008 to overcome a degenerative eye disease, made history at the Vancouver Olympics when he piloted the U.S. four-man bobsled team, nicknamed "Night Train," to the gold medal.
It marked the first U.S. gold medal in the event since 1948 and the three-time Olympian's comeback from depression over increasing blindness, according to his biography on the Team USA website.
Holcomb took bronze medals in both two-man and four-man bobsled at the 2014 Sochi Games. He also won five world titles among his 10 world championship medals and was a six-time overall world cup champion, winning 60 world cup medals.
The New York State Police, which is handling the case, had no immediate comment on Holcomb's death.
"The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb," U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun said in a statement.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and the entire bobsledding community."
Holcomb's autobiography, "But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold," had outlined how people suffering from depression should seek treatment, the Team USA profile said.
"USA Bobsled & Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend," said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Chief Executive Darrin Steele. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, N.C. and Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

ABUJA (Reuters) - Boko Haram militants have released dozens of schoolgirls out of a group of more than 200 whom they kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok in April 2014, officials said on Saturday.
A government minister, asking not to be named, said 82 girls had been released. Unconfirmed reports on social media put the number of freed girls at between 50 and 62.
"The girls were released through negotiations with the government," one official said, asking not to be named, adding that an official statement would follow shortly.
A military source said the girls were currently in Banki near the Cameroon border for medical checks before being airlifted to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.
The kidnapping was one of the high-profile incidents of Boko Haram's insurgency in Nigeria's northeast, now in its eighth year and with little sign of ending. About 220 were abducted from their school in a nighttime attack.
More than 20 girls were released last October in a deal brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Others have escaped or been rescued, but 195 were believed to be still in captivity before this release.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said last month that the government was in talks to secure the release of the remaining captives.
Although the Chibok girls are the most high-profile case, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of adults and children, many of whose cases have been neglected.
The militants have killed more than 20,000 people and displaced more than 2 million during their insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria.
Although the army has retaken much of the territory initially lost to Boko Haram, large parts of the northeast, particularly in Borno state, remain under threat from the militants. Suicide bombings and gun attacks have increased in the region since the end of the rainy season late last year.

First daughter Ivanka Trump has revealed that she and husband Jared Kushner are exploring Washington, D.C.—in fact, they took a walk around the National Mall Sunday night.
She added, "We're trying to explore this new environment and new city, and really sort of interact with it and enjoy it."
At one point, Kushner walked in the room and declined to be formally interviewed, but he described their nighttime walk as "Beautiful. Great Company. Beautiful scenery."
She and Kushner moved to a nearly 7,000-square-foot home in the upscale Kalorama neighborhood of D.C. in January.
She said, "I do believe that in time I'll get to the right place. In the short run I'll have missteps, and, in some cases, I'll take shots that I could have avoided if I had publicly said what I think."

France's election campaign commission said Saturday that it is examining the reported hacking attack on candidate Emmanuel Macron's political movement and subsequent document leaks online.
It urged French media not to publish the documents, warning that some of them are "probably" fake. It also urged citizens not to relay the data on social media to protect the integrity of the French vote.
French electoral law imposed a blackout Saturday and most of Sunday on any campaigning and media coverage seen as swaying the election, to allow voters a period of reflection before casting their ballots.
The Macron team asked the campaign oversight commission Saturday to bring in cybersecurity agency ANSSI to study the hack, according to a government official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the details publicly.
ANSSI can only be called in for cases where the cyberattack is "massive and sophisticated" — and the Macron hack appears to fit the bill, the official said.
Someone on 4chan — a site known, among other things, for cruel hoaxes and political extremism — posted links to a large set of data Friday night.
Macron is seen as the favorite going into Sunday's runoff against far-right leader Marine Le Pen, with most polls showing him leading the National Front candidate by double digits. 
The hacking incident comes at time when many have said that the future of the European Union and its currency, the Euro, hang in the balance depending on what voters decide Sunday.
Macron, a former investment banker and centrist, is widely seen as being pro-immigration and in favor of continuing and strengthening the European Union. 
Fears of hacking, fake news manipulation and Russian meddling clouded the French campaign but had largely gone unrealized — until late Friday's admission by Macron's campaign that it had suffered a coordinated online pirate attack had led to the leak of campaign emails and financial documents. It was unclear who was behind the hack and the leak.
Putin has long denied such claims. On Tuesday, during a tense meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian president was forced to again deny reports of Russian meddling in international elections.
Merkel said she was confident that Germany can weather any disinformation campaign targeting Germany's upcoming election. Asked about the threat during the news conference, she cited two recent incidents of what she described as "gross misinformation."
Le Pen, meanwhile, told The Associated Press that she believes she can pull off a surprise victory in the high-stakes vote that could change Europe's direction.
Le Pen has lately played down her plans to quit the EU and the euro, saying this may not be her top priority. But if she wins, the euro will fall around 5 percent in the immediate aftermath, a Reuters poll found this week.
A campaign blackout starting minutes after the Macron team announcement means that Le Pen's campaign can't legally comment on the leak.
In a statement, Macron's En Marche movement said the hack took place a few weeks ago, and that the leaked documents have been mixed with false documents to "seed doubt and disinformation" and destabilize Sunday's presidential runoff. Hillary Clinton's U.S. presidential campaign suffered similar leaks, and also said that authentic documents were mixed with false documents.
The documents' release just before France enters a roughly two-day-long blackout means that the leak may have very little impact beyond the overheated world of Twitter and Reddit.
On the other hand, the messages' release just before France's political machinery shuts down for the weekend might mean that talk of the leak - regardless of its veracity - will dominate dinner table conversations as French voters make up their minds Saturday.
The candidates stopped campaigning at midnight Friday to give voters a day of reflection before the election. It's a stark choice: Le Pen's anti-immigration, anti-European Union platform, or Macron's liberal, pro-EU stance.
From depressed northern France to the streets of Paris, few voters seemed aware Saturday of the hacking attack on Macron's team — although several were looking forward to the end of a vitriolic campaign.
In Henin-Beaumont in northern France, where Le Pen will cast her ballot on Sunday, 28-year-old Thomas Delannoy said the campaign "looks like reality TV." The construction painter called the electoral process "laughable," saying that neither candidate had a platform he could identify with.
Macron will vote Sunday in the seaside town of Le Touquet, where his wife Brigitte went for a walk Saturday with her daughter and grandchildren.

A Republican congressman from western New York has gotten an earful from constituents over his vote to repeal the federal health care law commonly called “ObamaCare.”
Reed defended his vote Thursday to repeal the Affordable Care Act and said there is “misinformation” about the replacement bill that narrowly passed the House of Representatives.
Some residents brought signs that said “Repeal and Replace Tom Reed” and “Reed Took Away Pre-Existing Coverage.”
Attendees at an earlier town hall in Hinsdale said they’re afraid they’ll lose coverage for pre-existing conditions, including cancer and diabetes.
Reed told them he hopes the new health bill will bring down costs. He said the current law is collapsing.
Similarly, across the country, Republican Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho faced a chorus of boos after claiming nobody dies due to lack of health care at a town hall on Friday.
“You are making a mandate that will kill people,” said a woman who stood up and challenged the Idaho representative over the newly passed bill.
Other House Republicans are bracing themselves for encounters with angry constituents when they return to their districts this weekend. 
Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), the centrist who negotiated the amendment that helped bring the House GOP’s healthcare bill over the finish line, expects his town hall next Wednesday could get rowdy. MacArthur noted the event is being held in Willingboro, N.J., where he only won 10 percent of the vote in the last election.

The entire town of St. George in Georgia’s southernmost county is now under a mandatory evacuation order issued after a wildfire in the Okefenokee Swamp began encroaching onto private property.
The unincorporated community has about 2,000 people. Saturday’s evacuation initially included a sparsely populated rural area of Charleton County from Jim Crawford Loop road south to St. George on the west side of Highway 121.
The area, on the Georgia-Florida line, is also under a dense smoke advisory that extends to northern Duval County near the Jacksonville International airport.
A temporary shelter has been opened in the gymnasium at the Folkston Elementary School.
The wildfire started by lightning April 6 and has since burned more than 150 square miles on public lands.

Min Bahadur Sherchan died at the Everest base camp on Saturday evening but the cause of death was not immediately clear, said Dinesh Bhattarai, chief of Nepal's Tourism Department.
Mountaineering official Gyanendra Shrestha, who is at the base camp, said the cause was likely cardiac arrest but he could not elaborate due to a poor telephone connection.
Sherchan, a grandfather of 17 and great-grandfather to six, first scaled Everest in May 2008 when he was 76 — at the time becoming the oldest climber to reach the top.
His record was broken in 2013 by 80-year-old Japanese climber Yuichiro Miura.
Before leaving for the mountain last month, Sherchan told The Associated Press that once he had completed the climb and became famous, he intended to travel to conflict areas to spread a message of peace.
He had trained for months before the attempt, saying that he did not suffer from any respiratory problems and his blood pressure was normal.
Being born in the mountains, he said he had did not have any problems with high altitude or the low levels of oxygen there.
Sherchan's love of mountaineering began in 1960 when he was assigned by the Nepalese government to be a liaison officer for the Swiss team climbing Mount Dhaulagiri.
He later became an apple farmer and constructed roads and dams before settling down to run hotels in Kathmandu.

He suited up and started digging through a mountain of trash. He recovered the phone in 30 minutes and it still worked.
Workers were close to dumping the trash into a 50-foot-high (15 meters) and 25-foot deep (7 meters) pile of garbage.
Covanta's Rich Harrington says there's a little better than 50 percent success rate when they can identify the trash truck.

Michelle Obama is back and she's confusing the heck out of Twitter.
On Friday afternoon our former FLOTUS tweeted what appears to be a phone number from her personal Twitter account, which was promptly deleted but not before some die-hard Obama fans grabbed screenshots.
Her tweet was a simple ten digits, yet it sparked massive curiosity across the internet. We, too, dying to know who the number belonged to, so we called.
Our hopes that we would soon be speaking with FLOTUS herself came to a crashing halt when the call went straight to voicemail of someone named Duncan Wolfe. Google Voice also identified the number as belonging to the name.
Today is my last day working at the White House || Over 9 years ago I arrived in snowy Iowa just in time play a very minor role in bringing home the most unexpected caucus victory for Senator Obama. Today, after attending the President's Farewell Address in Chicago last night, I return to the White House one last time to turn in my badge and walk out a completely changed person.  It will be a minute before I can process all that's happened, but I'm so grateful for all that have supported me and for all the amazing people I've met along the way. I couldn't have had a better team to work alongside. It's been an honor to serve this President in a job that has given me experiences I will never live down. Thanks for the photo @lowjack68
While we were busy getting the inside scoop, Twitter users who likely watched the number vanish before getting a chance to dial the digits began hypothesizing who Michelle could be attempting to put on blast by sharing the number.
What does this MEAN, Michelle?

KFC wants you to give your mom a romance novella for Mother's Day.
In fact, they wrote one for you to give her. This is great if you don't want to spend hours thinking about what kind of ingenue she considers herself. Very thoughtful of them, that chicken company.
Well, also, the novella is starring a hunky (by hunky we mean, like, he's described as muscular) Colonel Sanders, a chicken magnate turned sailor in disguise who romances a stagnant young woman.
Female protagonist Lady Madeline Parker first falls for Colonel Harland Sanders' "woolen peacoat crusted with sea salt," and his "light and fair" hair.
As their relationship grows, so does Lady Madeline's independence: "No longer did she have to maintain her modesty; on the contrary, she was free to be with whomever she desired, regardless of whether they were going to end up being her husband." Yes girl! Get it!
So, set aside a night that you feel comfortable looking back on with confusion, grab a bucket of fried chicken, and get to greasing up your Kindle. Happy Mothers' Day!

Membership is most certainly priced for the rich and famous with a $7,500 annual membership fee. That doesn't even include the terminal fee, which you have to pay every time you fly: $2,700 for up to four people. (That's $3,000 for international flights.) At least that includes free pre-flight massages and manicures.
The Private Suite experience is different from any other airport experience from the get-go. Travelers are screened by the TSA in the private terminal and don't have to deal with their baggage. A team of eight people are at your disposal, including several drivers and an airport escort.
"It typically takes 2,200 footsteps from car seat to plane seat," the website reads. "For members of The Private Suite, it's 70 footsteps. And they are all peaceful footsteps."
Instead of searching for your gate and then scrambling to buy a bottle of water and magazines to read on the plane, members can hang out in their fully stocked private suites or a shared lounge when waiting for their flight. Then, instead of lining up to board, members are driven on the tarmac straight to their plane "head-of-state style."
Experiencing #theprivatesuite at #LAX leaving for#shanghai  thank you Gavin de Becker for the amazing experience... up up and away!!!!✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️
Just checked into my own suite at the all new private celebrity terminal at LAX. Easily the most luxurious airport experience ever! 8 people taking care of each guest, suites right next to the runway, and private BMW chauffeur to the airplane stairs. Also, private TSA and Customs lounge just for you. This is bliss! #theprivatesuite #lax
If he was actually going to catch a flight, a silver BMW 7 Series would have taken him across the tarmac straight to his plane.
The major appeal of the private plane boarding and disembarking seems to be no paparazzi, which admittedly sounds great for stars hounded by cameras.
The only problem: Those suites are going to make it hard to want to get on the plane.

Two coffee shop unicorns are sharpening their horns to wage a legal battle.
Needless to say, Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino contained none of those ingredients.
Looks like 🎂🍭🍬🍦💎🍰🍩 . Tastes like 🍋🍯🌴🙃🤷🏼‍♀️💥🌈 . Made with 🌊🌿🌺🍯🍋🍈💙 . Makes you feel like ⚡️🙌👁🦄😍🤸🏽‍♀️🚀 . 📸: @shilin_cchen
However, The End claims that the Unicorn Frappuccino was too similar in outward appearance to their unicorn latte. Both drinks prominently display bright colors, pink and blue in particular.
The End also felt that Starbucks' product launch was designed to overshadow their unicorn latte, with the lawsuit also noting that The End has had a trademark pending on the drink name since January.
Image: starbucks
Starbucks, of course, stated that the accusations have no grounds. And while part of us hates siding with corporate giants, we may have to agree with them here. It's very hard to imagine that Starbucks designed both their drink and their marketing campaign to purposefully overshadow a small cafe in Brooklyn.
The drinks are also fundamentally different to their very core. Starbucks' unicorn is all about sugary sweetness while The End's unicorn attempts to help people find energy through all-natural ingredients (algae!). Because of that, these two unicorn drinks automatically target two almost completely different audiences. You drink the latte when you want to keep your good vibes going after some restorative yoga, and you drink the frappuccino when you want to treat yo'self and feel really guilty about it later.
Maybe everyone should just move on and stop the unicorn trend altogether.

Today in daily airline outrage: A husband and wife with two small children onboard a recent overbooked Delta flight were threatened with jail time after being told they could not use a seat they'd purchased for their 18-year-old son, who had instead taken an earlier flight.
Brian and Brittany Schear were flying from Maui to Los Angeles with their three children, reportedly ages 18, 2 and 1. They bought three tickets, likely thinking the youngsters would sit on the laps of the other three during the flight. But the family changed plans ahead of time, buying a ticket for their older son on an earlier flight so, as the father said, their other son would actually be able to sleep.
This did not sit well with Delta.
Because the Schear's older son never checked in for the later flight on which he was booked, the airline likely viewed it as an open seat available to a passenger not yet onboard.
The Schears bought the seat, though, and figured it wouldn't be a problem to set up a safety seat for one of their infants.

Thus, the conflict.
The video starts with Brian Schear being told that he and his wife could wind up in jail with their children in "foster care" if they didn't give up their third seat.
The situation was already tense, but it's about to get confusing, so stay with me.
At this point, a woman introduces herself and begins to explain the situation, although she doesn't appear to have a good grip on what she's explaining. Presumably an airline employee, she informs the Schears that their younger son has to be held in their laps instead of a safety seat.
"With him being two, he cannot sit in the car seat," she says, and goes on to say that this is an FAA regulation.
In fact, the opposite is true. According to an emailed FAA statement, "children two [years] of age or older are required to be in their own seat."
We've asked Delta to get on the phone with us in hopes of clearing up which employees were responsible for providing incorrect information, and why that information was provided in the first place. They haven't taken us up on it yet.
Now, it seems logical to just transfer the older son's ticket to the younger son. With a new name attached to the seat, the flight manifest would accurately reflect the actual flight, and everyone onboard could go about their business. But Delta doesn't allow ticket transfers.
After it becomes plain that the Schears won't be able to use the three seats they purchased, Brian asks whether — for the sake of finally taking off — they can just hold their kids and get out of there.
Apparently not. He's told, "it's come too far," and their options are either to go or Delta will deplane everyone.
"What are we supposed to do?" Schear asks. "I've got two infants, and my wife, we have nowhere to stay, there's no more flights. What are we supposed to do, sleep in the airport?"
Schear presses for an answer, but the (presumable) Delta employee says it's not up to her or any of her colleagues.
"At this point, you guys are on your own," she says.
"Un-fucking-real," Schear says.
Hard to disagree.

Farkhan Mahmood Shah, a Pakistani-American, alleges that his co-workers called him a terrorist and said that he was a member of the Taliban or Hezbollah. One flight attendant also reportedly tried to convert him to the Christian faith.
Shah has worked for American Airlines as a flight attendant since 1999. According to the lawsuit, his first report of harassment occurred in 2008. After reporting the harassment, Shah said he faced retaliation when he noticed incorrect marks on his attendance record for missing work or being late. In 2013, Shah brought up the false marks on his record and was told it would be fixed, but it never was.

According to Shah's complaint, one of his co-workers also allegedly said, "It was the Muslims and that Muslims are evil" during a conversation about the Sept. 11 attacks. According to the lawsuit, Shah responded to co-workers saying some people claimed 9/11 was an inside job and that the CIA created ISIS.
After making those remarks, Shah said in the lawsuit he was reported to supervisors and then placed on a watchlist by American Airlines several weeks later. The complaint also said FBI agents paid a visit to Shah's home in Edison, New Jersey. Shah also said that he was offered no resolution with his harassment case, and that he was referred to different human resources representatives.
Shah's lawsuit, filed to the Superior Court in Middlesex County, seeks damages, attorney fees and other relief funds.

Edward Crawford, a St. Louis resident who was the subject of an iconic photo epitomizing the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, is dead.
Crawford was photographed throwing a flaming tear gas canister in an image broadcast widely during the months of unrest that followed the fatal shooting of Michael Brown Jr. by a police officer.
His death was confirmed to NBC News by the St. Louis Office of the Medical Examiner. Investigator Rose Psara said Crawford was pronounced deceased shortly before midnight on Thursday at 1435 Salisbury Street in the Hyde Park neighborhood.
The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department told NBC News that Crawford shot himself in the backseat of a car while it was moving, according to two witnesses who were seated in the front of the car.
"The victim began expressing he was distraught over personal matters to the witnesses," said the police department's Public Information Officer Leah Freeman. "The witnesses heard the victim rummaging in the backseat, then heard a gunshot and observed the victim had sustained a gunshot wound to the head."
Crawford was pronounced dead on the scene. Police said an investigation is ongoing and, while initially declared a suicide, the official cause of death will be determined by an autopsy.
According to his father, Edward Crawford Sr., the 27-year-old was the father of four young children, had just gotten a new apartment, and was training for a warehouse job.
It's not the first time a notable Ferguson protester has died from gunfire.
NBC News sent several requests for comment about the death of Edward Crawford to the St. Louis Police Department but did not receive a response.
It is unclear where Crawford's body was found.
On social media, notable leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and the St. Louis community mourned Crawford's death.
Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said that Crawford was a local hero after he famously picked up the tear gas canister and threw it out of the way of protesters.
In the photograph, which won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography in 2015, Crawford appeared to be throwing the canister back at police while wearing a shirt emblazoned with an American flag. The photo came to symbolize anger at police killings of unarmed black youth.
He was later charged for assault and for interfering with a police officer in relation to the tear gas incident.
"I didn't throw a burning can back at police," said Crawford. "I threw it out of the way of children."

There isn't much North Korean media, but what little exists is full of images of nuclear destruction — of U.S. cities incinerated by North Korean nukes. News anchors promise that a coming conflict will leave Washington in "a sea of fire." A Communist party website warned Tuesday that Pyongyang is "waiting for the moment it will reduce the whole of the U.S. mainland to ruins."
North Korean propaganda has gotten so over-the-top that after that last headline, the Chinese urged the Koreans to pipe down. The Chinese Foreign Ministry suggested both the North and the U.S. should "remain calm and exercise restraint, stop irritating each other," which experts said was directed more at Pyongyang than D.C.

It all sounds very ominous, but is it? While the tempo of anti-U.S. rhetoric is higher than in past years, there hasn't been that much of a change in its content. As one U.S. intelligence official noted, there's always been "hyperbole and propaganda in their messaging."
In fact, say experts and U.S. officials, most of the rhetoric so widely replayed in Western media is not meant for the world stage but for internal consumption in the "hermit kingdom."
Still, at least one expert on North Korean propaganda said that while a lot of Pyongyang's rhetorical flourishes are "eminently mockable," they shouldn't be ignored.

"Their bluster now carries more weight," said Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo Korea Foundation Professor in Korean Studies at the Fletcher School. "We can patronize them, but when their ability to carry out such attacks gets close, when they show the technology, I think their threats become more credible."
Lee also said that outsiders "should not be reduced to patronizing a regime that is very cruel."
A second U.S. intelligence official said the recent increase in noise is about attention.
"They need it," said the official, noting they weren't getting it from the Obama administration. "So they've been pounding out stuff at a sustained pace for at least a year."
See Gallery
And the messaging can get even more personal. Lee points to attacks on President Obama and the recently impeached president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, in 2015. Obama, he said, was referred to as a "wicked black monkey" who should return to Africa "and feed off bread crumbs thrown by tourists" while Park was called a "dirty old whore." The North, Lee said, received criticism in the international community for its racist and sexist commentary.
Some of the more recent videos directed against the U.S. have high production values, with heavy use of graphics and animations.
One U.S. official said the videos are at once a throwback to earlier Cold War messaging and strangely au courant. He called them "almost post-modern, ironic rather than earnest."
There is a numbing sameness to North Korea's words and imagery, but the U.S. monitors the messages closely for any changes. As a second U.S. official said, if the Koreans stop talking about turning South Korea into a "sea of fire" and threaten something even more horrific, the intelligence community — and the world — need to take note.

One U.S. archdiocese is cutting ties with the Girl Scouts of the USA because it apparently promotes "programs and materials reflective of many of the troubling trends in our secular culture."
Archbishop Joseph Naumann of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas said the organization is "no longer a compatible partner." 
He cited its relationship with an international scouting association that he said advocates for "contraception and abortion as preventive health care for women." He also has concerns with the Girl Scouts featuring Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan as role models because they "stand in stark opposition to what we believe."

Donald Trump is convinced that the Mideast should no longer be riven by violence and that peace is within reach.
"I want to see peace with Israel and the Palestinians," he told Reuters in an interview last week. "There is no reason there's not peace between Israel and the Palestinians — none whatsoever."
For decades, this goal has eluded world leaders, including Trump's predecessor Barack Obama. That Trump has tasked his son-in-law Jared Kushner with negotiating peace and longtime lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, to be his on-the-ground envoy deal are signs of the importance the president places on the issue.
A possible step in the direction of peace will be his meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday.
But according to Ghassan Khatib, a professor of political science at Birzeit University in the West Bank, Trump may be underestimating the task at hand.
"The main concern for Palestinians is to make him understand that there are two sides ... and that the second side is important," he said.
See Gallery
This "second side" is the Palestinian version of a long-running struggle that many such as Khatib feel Trump may not possess an in-depth knowledge of.
At the heart of the conflict is the Palestinians' desire for an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem — land Israel captured in 1967. Talks for this have ground to a halt with each side accusing the other of not being willing negotiate in good faith.
According to Israeli emergency services, some 48 Israelis were killed and 608 wounded in attacks by individual Palestinians since August 2015 — the latest bout of violence. During the same period, around 260 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces and more than 18,000 wounded, according to Palestinian officials.
Palestinians also allege that Israel is undermining efforts to achieve an independent state by allowing Jewish settlement on land occupied after the Six-Day War in 1967. The number of settlers on territory claimed by the Palestinians grew from 198,300 in 2000 to 385,900 in 2015, according to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. Palestinians complain that these growing settlements make a contiguous state impossible.

Trump also has a cordial relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying early on that he wanted to strengthen America's relationship with Israel — which is already the U.S.'s largest recipient of foreign aid.
While admonishing Israel in February over Jewish communities being built on Palestinian land, saying that he would like Netanyahu to "hold back on settlements," Trump also unexpectedly shifted years of U.S. policy when he withheld clear support for an independent Palestine.
This possible endorsement of a one-nation solution to the conflict would be very difficult for both sides. It would either end up being two systems for two peoples, which Palestinians would see as apartheid and unending occupation — or equal rights for all, which would compromise Israel's Jewish character.
So for Palestinians, it will be vital that Abbas simply presents an alternate view of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
"For us the most important thing in this meeting is that it will allow a Palestinian perspective," Khatib said. "The current American president is very familiar with the Israeli side and is constantly in touch with the Israeli point of view, but is a stranger to the Palestinian narrative."
Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at London's Chatham House think tank, said it is possible that Trump's well-known unpredictability could be a positive for the Palestinians.
"He's not interested in details," he said. "Israelis and Palestinians know all the details. What Trump can contribute is that he is ready to act regardless of not knowing the details, which might do something ... in the unpredictable world we live in right now."
Trump's close relationship with Netanyahu will not be the only thing the Palestinian Authority leader is up against. Abbas, 82, also faces challenges at home. Palestinians — who are partly governed by militant group Hamas which has ruled the seaside enclave of Gaza since it won an election there in 2006 — are more despondent and divided than ever.
There is widespread disappointment at the lack of a political solution to the Israeli occupation and general malaise brought on by a slowing economy and high unemployment.
Israel has fought three wars with Hamas, which does not recognize its legitimacy as an independent Jewish state. Militant rockets are often fired at Israeli territory. The group rules the desperately poor population of approximately 1.9 million people — 1.3 million of whom are refugees displaced during the establishment of the state of Israel — with an iron fist.
Abbas' Palestinian Authority is also at odds with Hamas in Gaza, which has been blockaded by the Israelis for years. His security officials regularly crack down on the pockets of the hard-line group in the West Bank.
Kobi Michael, from the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, called the release of the Hamas document "an internal Palestinian game."
He added: "The pressure is for Hamas to change its policy and position towards Israel. They are not giving up on their armed resistance."
In other words, Hamas is simply repositioning itself within the Palestinian political scene, according to Michael.
But Mekelberg — the Chatham House associate fellow — said Hamas' document was much more important than that, and so those looking for peace in Israel and beyond should seize on it in a bid toward a negotiated peace.
"It is a significant move," said Mekelberg, who is also the head of international relations at Regent's University in London. "It indicates that Hamas is not monolithic ... and that they reached a conclusion that militarily they are not going to defeat Israel."
Regardless of internal Palestinian politics, Trump's planned visits or regional and international opinion, longtime British diplomat and Middle East watcher Richard Dalton said it was high time that the United States took Palestinian aspirations seriously.
"Every day we hear that freedom is the motivating spirit of the United States," said Dalton, who served as Britain's effective ambassador to the Palestinian Authority in 1993 to 1997. "But it is never recognized that Palestinians have the right to that same freedom."

A white former South Carolina police officer pleaded guilty Tuesday to violating the civil rights of Walter Scott, the unarmed black motorist he shot dead in 2015.
"The defendant used deadly force even though it was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances," the plea agreement says.
Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Scott's brother, Anthony, thanked federal prosecutors and said his family was grateful to have "justice."
"For me and my family, the healing starts today," Anthony Scott said, adding that Slager's guilty plea was a "victory" for his city, state, country and the world.
Walter Scott's mother, Judy, fought back tears as she told reporters she forgives Slager.
"I forgive Michael Slager because the forgiver is in me. That he [Slager] admitted he did it was enough years for me," she said.
Slager, 35, pulled over Scott on April 4, 2015, due to a broken taillight. Scott, 50, then ran from the traffic stop. The incident escalated, Slager has claimed, when Scott wrestled away the officer's Taser. Slager then fired his weapon as Scott ran away. Scott was struck five times in the back.
See Gallery
Slager's federal trial was set to begin on May 15, and jury selection was slated to begin May 9.
The former officer pleaded guilty to violating Scott's civil rights by shooting him with no justification — formally known as deprivation of rights under color of law. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
"We hope that Michael's acceptance of responsibility will help the Scott family as they continue to grieve their loss," Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, said in a statement. Sentencing has not yet been scheduled, Savage said.
The shooting itself heightened tension nationwide over alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement and systemic racism in policing.

When a family of crocodiles stole a tiger’s meal, the big cat refused to give up.
It sat for nearly 8 hours, watching the crocodiles fail at consuming his meal.
So, the big ferocious cat went back into the crocodile infested waters to reclaim his meal.
Watch what happens.
The strike, which utilized over 50 Tomahawk missiles, took place around 8:45pm EST. Trump, who is at Mar-a-Lago, made a statement from his private club to announce the action, specifically mentioning retaliation for al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons.
“My fellow Americans, on Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of beautiful men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror.
Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be  no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behavior have all failed and failed very dramatically.
As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies. Tonight I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for God’s wisdom as we face the challenges of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed and we hope that as long as America stands for justice then peace and harmony will, in the end, prevail.
Goodnight and God bless America and the entire world. Thank you.”
Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau led a delegation of 600 people, including more than 125 United Nations ambassadors, to a Broadway play. Ivanka Trump was also invited and in attendance that night.
The show is filled with symbolism that points to the importance of welcoming outsiders, a message that is very much at odds with what Ivanka’s father, President Donald Trump, is pushing for with his recent travel bans.
Also in attendance at the show that night was a woman whose name you might not recognize – Diane Davis.
Davis is a resident of the small town in Canada that welcomed the stranded travelers, one of the people on whom the show’s characters are based.
Davis, along with the other residents of Gander, Newfoundland, welcomed the travelers, showing them kindness and generosity at a time when everything seemed uncertain, especially safety.
During a telephone interview with Rare, Davis, who now works with and advocates for refugees, revealed what she hopes Ivanka took away from the play and possibly relayed to her father.
David said that she hopes Ivanka took away the message that “everyone in the community did the best they could do at the time to provide something to someone in need. […] There’s no need to fear someone because they’re different.”
She added: “I would hope that she saw that every person who was stranded, no matter their religion or their politics or their skin color or their sexual orientation, had the same needs of shelter and food and comfort.”
She also made sure to point out that the show’s message isn’t just important for America, saying, “It’s also an important message for Canada and other countries.”
Davis used her time at the show to advocate for refugees to the Canadian prime minister, telling him that a large portion of the refugees that she works with are fully employed, paying taxes and have integrated well into Canadian life.

The “Mother of All Bombs” is the largest non-nuclear weapon ever fired dropped by the United States military.
“And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you/Brought to you Courtesy of the Red White and Blue,” Keith could be heard singing in his song.
Fox’s Brian Kilmeade seemed pleased as punch about the bomb.
“That’s what happens when a 21 thousand bomb, uh, a 21 thousand pound bomb explodes in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region where at least 36 ISIS fighters have lost their life,” Kilmeade said.

May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. bobsledder Steven Holcomb, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead at a training site on Saturday, the U.S. Olympic Committee said.
Holcomb, 37, was discovered in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York, the committee said in a statement. It gave no further details.
Holcomb, who underwent successful surgery in 2008 to overcome a degenerative eye disease, made history at the Vancouver Olympics when he piloted the U.S. four-man bobsled team, nicknamed "Night Train," to the gold medal.
It marked the first U.S. gold medal in the event since 1948 and the three-time Olympian's comeback from depression over increasing blindness, according to his biography on the Team USA website.
Holcomb took bronze medals in both two-man and four-man bobsled at the 2014 Sochi Games. He also won five world titles among his 10 world championship medals and was a six-time overall world cup champion, winning 60 world cup medals.
The New York State Police, which is handling the case, had no immediate comment on Holcomb's death.
"The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb," U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun said in a statement.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and the entire bobsledding community."
Holcomb's autobiography, "But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold," had outlined how people suffering from depression should seek treatment, the Team USA profile said.
"USA Bobsled & Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend," said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Chief Executive Darrin Steele. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, N.C. and Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

ABUJA (Reuters) - Boko Haram militants have released dozens of schoolgirls out of a group of more than 200 whom they kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok in April 2014, officials said on Saturday.
A government minister, asking not to be named, said 82 girls had been released. Unconfirmed reports on social media put the number of freed girls at between 50 and 62.
"The girls were released through negotiations with the government," one official said, asking not to be named, adding that an official statement would follow shortly.
A military source said the girls were currently in Banki near the Cameroon border for medical checks before being airlifted to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.
The kidnapping was one of the high-profile incidents of Boko Haram's insurgency in Nigeria's northeast, now in its eighth year and with little sign of ending. About 220 were abducted from their school in a nighttime attack.
More than 20 girls were released last October in a deal brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Others have escaped or been rescued, but 195 were believed to be still in captivity before this release.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said last month that the government was in talks to secure the release of the remaining captives.
Although the Chibok girls are the most high-profile case, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of adults and children, many of whose cases have been neglected.
The militants have killed more than 20,000 people and displaced more than 2 million during their insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria.
Although the army has retaken much of the territory initially lost to Boko Haram, large parts of the northeast, particularly in Borno state, remain under threat from the militants. Suicide bombings and gun attacks have increased in the region since the end of the rainy season late last year.

FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Leading French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign said on Friday it had been the target of a "massive" computer hack that dumped its campaign emails online 1-1/2 days before voters choose between the centrist and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen.
Macron, who is seen as the frontrunner in an election billed as the most important in France in decades, extended his lead over Le Pen in polls on Friday.
As much as 9 gigabytes of data were posted on a profile called EMLEAKS to Pastebin, a site that allows anonymous document sharing. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for posting the data or if any of it was genuine.
See Gallery
In a statement, Macron's political movement En Marche! (Onwards!) confirmed that it had been hacked.
"The En Marche! Movement has been the victim of a massive and co-ordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information," the statement said.
An interior ministry official declined to comment, citing French rules that forbid any commentary liable to influence an election, which took effect at midnight on Friday (2200 GMT).
The presidential election commission said in statement that it would hold a meeting later on Saturday after Macron's campaign informed it about the hack and publishing of the data.
It urged the media to be cautious about publishing details of the emails given that campaigning had ended, and publication could lead to criminal charges.
Comments about the email dump began to appear on Friday evening just hours before the official ban on campaigning began. The ban is due to stay in place until the last polling stations close Sunday at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
Opinion polls show independent centrist Macron is set to beat National Front candidate Le Pen in Sunday's second round of voting, in what is seen to be France's most important election in decades. The latest surveys show him winning with about 62 percent of the vote.
RUSSIAN HAND SEEN
Former economy minister Macron's campaign has previously complained about attempts to hack its emails, blaming Russian interests in part for the cyber attacks.
On April 26, the team said it had been the target of a attempts to steal email credentials dating back to January, but that the perpetrators had failed to compromise any campaign data.
The Kremlin has denied it was behind any such attacks, even though Macron's camp renewed complaints against Russian media and a hackers' group operating in Ukraine.
Vitali Kremez, director of research with New York-based cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, told Reuters his review indicates that APT 28, a group tied to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, was behind the leak. He cited similarities with U.S. election hacks that have been previously attributed to that group.
APT28 last month registered decoy internet addresses to mimic the name of En Marche, which it likely used send tainted emails to hack into the campaign's computers, Kremez said. Those domains include onedrive-en-marche.fr and mail-en-marche.fr.
"If indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome," Kremez said.
France is the latest nation to see a major election overshadowed by accusations of manipulation through cyber hacking.
U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of parties tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to influence the election on behalf of Republican rival Donald Trump.
On Friday night as the #Macronleaks hashtag buzzed around social media, Florian Philippot, deputy leader of the National Front, tweeted "Will Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?"
Macron spokesman Sylvain Fort, in a response on Twitter, called Philippot's tweet "vile".
En Marche! said the documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but that authentic documents had been mixed on social media with fake ones to sow "doubt and misinformation".
Ben Nimmo, a UK-based security researcher with the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank, said initial analysis indicated that a group of U.S. far-right online activists were behind early efforts to spread the documents via social media. They were later picked up and promoted by core social media supporters of Le Pen in France, Nimmo said.
The leaks emerged on 4chan, a discussion forum popular with far right activists in the United States. An anonymous poster provided links to the documents on Pastebin, saying, "This was passed on to me today so now I am giving it to you, the people."
The hashtag #MacronLeaks was then spread by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist whose Twitter profile identifies him as Washington D.C. bureau chief of the far-right activist site Rebel TV, according to Nimmo and other analysts tracking the election. Contacted by Reuters, Posobiec said he had simply reposted what he saw on 4chan.
"You have a hashtag drive that started with the alt-right in the United States that has been picked up by some of Le Pen's most dedicated and aggressive followers online," Nimmo told Reuters.
Alt-right refers to a loose-knit group of far-right activists known for their advocacy of extremist ideas, rejection of mainstream conservatism and disruptive social media tactics.

The man believed to be the world's heaviest was preparing on Friday, May 5th to undergo biliopancreatic bypass surgery in Mexico.
According to local media, thirty-three-year-old Juan Pedro Franco - who has weighed up to 1,311 pounds - has been largely bed-ridden for the last seven years due to his large size. He was recently put on a diet to help shed some weight as doctors fear for his life.
The surgery is scheduled to take place on May 9, after Franco dropped 385 pounds over the last couple of months, making surgery possible.
See Gallery
Five days before surgery are needed to prepare for the operation, where blood, imaging, pulmonary and cardiac function will be studied by a team of doctors.
Franco has battled obesity all of his life, but the problem took a turn for the worse following an injury at age 17.
Juan Pedro is from the small Mexican state of Aguacalientes and has been in Guadalajara for his treatment, over the last couple of months.
His mother, Maria de Jesus Salas Lemus, is optimistic about the outcome of the surgery.
Threats to his health ranging from diabetes to organ failure prompted the surgery, which is an important challenge for the medical science team due to Franco's weight.
Franco's doctor, Jose Castaneda will operate on Franco, together with other specialists including an instrumentalist as well as a team of two anaesthesiologists and a cardiologist who will watch over Franco's vital signs during the 20 -minute surgery.
Hopeful that his treatment will be a success, Franco also remains positive.
According to the World Health Organisation, Mexico is a global leader in obesity with 35 percent of its adolescents overweight or obese.

            Places that lacked an electrical grid and land-line telephones throughout the 20th century are powering their homes and businesses with the latest 21st-century technology.         

                    In some of the most remote locations of the world, technology exists in a kind of twisting time warp.                

                    Consider Kenya.                

                    In many remote towns and villages, bedrock technologies of the 20th century - like the electrical grid and land-line telephones - simply never arrived. But cutting-edge technologies, like solar panels and smart phones, are popping up with increasing regularity. And that's making Kenya an ideal setting for testing a variety of fast-moving entrepreneurial initiatives.                

                    The British-Kenyan startup company SteamaCo, for example, has been combining solar energy with mobile technology to bring affordable electricity to rural communities bypassed by the 20th century.                

                    The company specializes in working with local technicians to set up small, self-sustaining solar microgrids that harvest energy from Africa's abundantly sunny climate. By way of high-capacity solar panels and local power hubs, SteamaCo and its partners supply electricity to homes and businesses that lie too far away from municipal power grids.                

                    In the absence of existing infrastructure and entrenched business interests, companies can deploy clean tech relatively cheaply and rapidly. It's an intriguing 21st-century inversion: Some Kenyan villagers can access clean energy options that aren't commercially available in many parts of the developed world.                

                    But a fundamental challenge remains: How does an energy provider collect payment in places where you can't hire meter readers or send bills?                

                    That's where the mobile phones come in.                

                    Kenya is one of the busiest mobile phone markets in the world, according to World Bank. Upwards of 95 percent of Kenyans are mobile phone users, while only 32 percent have regular access to a traditional power grid.                

                    SteamaCo allows customers to prepay for their electricity by way of mobile banking platforms, like Paypal and M-Pesa. Kenyans are quickly adopting the process because it works like the prepaid mobile phone services with which they are already accustomed.                

                    "Since we came to this town, a number of businesses have come up," says Nyagilo. "The system is able to power welding, people are starting barber shops, video shows. We are now able to serve cold beers."                

                    Kenya isn't the only country powering up with help from their mobil phones. SteamaCo says it operates 40 minigrids in seven African and Asian countries, and is expanding its mobile payment system to include access to irrigation pumps and biogas facilities.

            The heavy-lift Long March-5 booster made its long-awaited debut flight on Thursday.        

                    "The Long March-5 is needed to lift the station modules," said Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College in Rhode Island.                

                    "They are building infrastructure and building blocks for a long-term human presence in space," Johnson-Freese, an expert on China's space program, told Seeker.                

                    China's state-run media reported that the Long March-5 blasted off from the Wenchang Space Launch center in south China's Hainan province at 8:43 p.m. Beijing time (8:43 a.m. EDT).                

                    The rocket, which stands 187 feet tall and is fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, is more than twice as powerful as any previous Chinese booster. It is capable of carrying payloads weighting as much as 27 tons into low-altitude orbits around Earth.                

                    That makes the Long March-5 twice as powerful as any previous Chinese booster and nearly the matching the lift capacity of the most powerful rocket in the U.S. fleet, the Delta 4 Heavy, made by United Launch Alliance.                

                    China's new rocket is more powerful than Europe's Ariane 5 and Russia's Proton.                

                    U.S. satellites and satellites with U.S. components are prohibited from flying on Chinese rockets due to concerns about missile technology ending up in enemy hands. The regulation are  known as ITAR, or International Traffic in Arms Reduction.                

                    NASA and private companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, are working on even bigger rockets that will be needed for human exploration and development of the moon and Mars, and for sending robotic probes on fast tracks to planets and moons farther away in the solar system.

            Memory might form simultaneously in the hippocampus and the cortex, but remain "silent" in the cortex for several weeks before maturing.        

            While there are atmospheres around much larger gas giants orbiting other stars, this is the first evidence of an atmosphere around an exoplanet that's near Earth's size.        

                    But the researchers also found something strange, they said: One of the wavelengths showed a larger dip in brightness than the others each time the planet passed by. This world, for some reason, appeared larger at that wavelength than at others, suggesting that the planet had a surrounding atmosphere that this wavelength couldn't penetrate, the researchers said.                

                    Going forward, GJ 1132b's atmosphere will be a high-priority target for study with the Hubble Space Telescope, ESO's Very Large Telescope and the future James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2018, the researchers added.

Retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Randolph "Tex" Alles, the current head of Customs and Border Protection, was named the director of the Secret Service on Tuesday.
Alles will take over for Secret Service Deputy Director William Callahan, who has been leading the agency in an acting capacity since March 4, when then-Director Joseph Clancy retired.
Alles' selection by President Donald Trump does not require Senate approval, and it marks a departure for the Secret Service, whose leaders have typically come from within its own ranks.

The announcement was made in a brief statement distributed by the White House.
The former major general will inherit an agency that's been mired in scandals, negative press attention and low morale.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is embarking on an ambitious early childhood education plan to make full-day preschool free for all 3-year-olds regardless of family income by 2021.
"This is going to be a game-changer," the Democratic mayor said while announcing the plan Monday at a school in the Bronx.
The plan, dubbed 3-K for All, is intended to build on the city's ongoing efforts to provide prekindergarten education to all 4-year-olds through an initiative known as Pre-K for All, which the city says has more than tripled the number of 4-year-olds enrolled in pre-K education since it launched in 2014.
"This extra year of education will provide our children with a level of academic and social development that they cannot get later on, while at the same time, alleviating some of the strain New York City's working families face today," de Blasio said.
​​​​​​"Research shows children benefit more from two years of high quality pre-K than one year," says Abbie Lieberman, an early education policy analyst for Washington think tank New America. "There's been so much attention to pre-K for 4-year-olds, but very few have expanded access to 3-year-olds."
By the fall of 2018, officials hope to have a seat readily available for every 3-year-old living in those two districts, projecting an enrollment of about 1,800 children there – triple the number enrolled today, according to the mayor's office.
Providing free, full-day early education to every 3-year-old child in the city will save families approximately $10,000 in child care, according to the mayor's office and the New York City Center for Economic Opportunity, which also reportedly estimates that 1 in 4 families who take advantage of the benefit are likely to work an average of four more hours per week, resulting in an estimated $2,400 in additional income per family.
"The benefits of early care and education programs have a clear and measurable impact on the health and wellness of children and communities as a whole," Herminia Palacio, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services, said in a statement. "By introducing 3K for All and strengthening programs in the birth-to-5 continuum, New York City is ensuring that all children, including those who are most vulnerable, get a critical boost that will positively impact their lives for years to come."
"I'm happy to see they are implementing it a little more slowly than Pre-K for All," she says. "This would allow for more thoughtful implementation. Scaling up too quickly can jeopardize quality, and that was a big concern for Pre-K for All."

Aside from traditional public high schools, parents may already be able to send their teens to charter schools – public schools run by independent organizations with more flexibility to experiment with how schools operate. There are also magnet schools, which are designed around a theme, like STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – and may attract more academically gifted students via an application.

U.S. News evaluated more than 28,000 public high schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Five hundred public high schools received gold medals, 2,109 took home silver and 3,432 received bronze in the national rankings.
First, U.S. News looked at student performance on state-required tests during the 2014-2015 school year. Schools had to perform better than statistically expected on these tests in their state, given their student poverty levels, to make it to the next step. Then, schools were evaluated on whether their least-advantaged students – those of black, Hispanic and low-income backgrounds – performed at or better than the state average.
The third step required schools that passed the first two steps to have a graduation rate of at least 75 percent. Those that did made it to the final phase – which determined if their national ranking was a gold, silver or bronze medal. In this fourth step, U.S. News looked at how well schools prepared students for college based on participation in and performance on Advanced Placement exams.
The top 25 nationally ranked high schools performed equally in this phase and a new tiebreaker process was used to determine their numerical ranks. The tiebreaker looked at the percentages of seniors who took and passed AP exams in at least four different subject areas – which showed how well students were prepared for college across a variety of disciplines.
The International Baccalaureate Organization was unable to provide U.S. News with IB data as it had in previous years for the final step, so schools only using IB exams weren't eligible to receive gold or silver medals. But like all high schools that pass the first three steps of the methodology, IB schools were eligible for bronze medals.
In a new feature to the rankings, some schools with bronze medals performed well enough on college readiness to be numerically ranked within their own state.

Yes, even the rich and famous have to deal with mental illness. Here are 25 celebrities that have talked about their battle.
It was really bad. The first time I had a panic attack I was sitting in my friend’s house, and I thought the house was burning down. I called my mom and she brought me home, and for the next three years it just would not stop. I would go to the nurse at lunch most days and just wring my hands. I would ask my mom to tell me exactly how the day was going to be, then ask again 30 seconds later. I just needed to know that no one was going to die and nothing was going to change.
She went on to explain why acting is therapeutic for her. “There’s something about the immediacy of acting,” Stone continued. “You can’t afford to think about a million other things. You have to think about the task at hand. Acting forces me to sort of be like a Zen master: What is happening right in this moment?”
Affleck will play Coughlin, while Chris Messina, Sienna Miller, Brendan Gleeson, Elle Fanning, and Max Casella will co-star. The movie is scheduled for a limited release on December 25, before a wide release on January 13.

Well, no offense, but it’s probably something you said — or something you did — maybe without even knowing. The job search can be a long and gruesome row to hoe, with many interview do’s and don’ts getting buried beneath the weeds.
So it’s time for a refresher course on interview mistakes. Some you might know, but others you might have forgotten (such as No. 9). Regardless, you should avoid these mistakes at all costs when looking for a new job.

Bad hygiene is a surefire way to land your application in the trash. Sloppy clothes and unwashed hair can be off-putting to anyone, especially hiring managers. Pay close attention to your hygiene. Do you, um, smell funny? Your days of showing up to an 8 a.m. class disheveled after a Thursday night full of college frat parties are over. Wear a subtle amount of perfume, and remember to apply deodorant. Comb your hair, and brush your teeth. An overpowering aroma will definitely make you a memorable candidate — but not in the way you’d hoped.
You better get your timing down …

More recently, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked a Trump administration order to withhold funding from cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a temporary ruling that will stay in place while the lawsuit moves forward.
Plus, the billions of dollars cities get from the federal government don’t come from a single source. Money flows into cities for housing, education, transit, cultural programs, and more from different branches of the federal government. Some of it goes directly to city government, but separate agencies and nonprofit organizations also receive funds. Terminating all of those payments would likely be difficult. Complicating matters is there’s no single, clear definition of a sanctuary city.
Let’s take a closer look at which 15 cities Trump could punish the most.

Newark received more than $200 million in 2016 from the federal government, including $70 million for the Newark Public Housing Authority and $59 million for the city’s public schools. But those numbers haven’t stopped city leaders from speaking out against Trump’s threat to cut off sanctuary cities.

We’ve become accustomed to seeing the negative headlines bubble to the top of our respective news feeds when it comes to the economy. Jobs are being lost in sector X, for example, or perhaps a politician running for office is trying to make the economy look a lot worse than it is. But there is good news to report, too. Unemployment is currently pretty low, for one, and average incomes for middle-class households are on the rise as well.
Not only that, but there are many jobs that are actually seeing wage boosts — which is something we’re not used to hearing about given the prevailing political and economic climate.
Here are those 13 jobs experiencing the largest salary and pay increases over the past year.

That doesn't mean some — like Bill Maher — aren't ready to lob some criticism, not necessarily at Kimmel but more at the ideas he presented. Thankfully, it has nothing to do with Kimmel's situation with his son — it would take a real heel to criticize that on television — but Maher does take exception with Kimmel's assertion that all sides land along the same lines on basic healthcare. When Kimmel says Republicans and Democrats all agree that "If your baby's going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make," Maher stops his audience from applauding and proceeds to rant:
"Unfortunately that's not true, One side wants to tax rich people so that babies don't have to die and one side is mostly against that. And this lets Republicans off the hook...
"Let's not f*ck around with this, we are not on the same page with this."
See photos of Bill Maher:

Maher sprinkled healthcare talk throughout Friday's show, kicking things off with a monologue that made fun of the celebration in The White House rose garden and saying that the GOP told Jimmy Kimmel's baby "go screw yourself." It also led to Maher dropping a New Rule that called out the folks who characterized the 2016 election as a "choice between the lesser of two evils." He includes plenty of other examples from Trump's first 100 days, including his many questionable cabinet positions, and proceeds to lecture all of the major names that seemed to put Clinton in the same basket with Trump.

Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon may be trying to make their relationship work again.
The couple, who got divorced back in 2015 after six years of marriage, have always spent a lot of time together, especially when with their children. They share twins Moroccan and Monroe, 6, and frequently post photos on social media and attend events together as a foursome. A couple week after stepping out as a family to the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, Carey and Cannon brought their twins to Disneyland for their birthday.

Though another insider contends that they're merely "co-parenting," the other source's claims make sense given that Carey recently broke up with her background dancer boyfriend, who she was dating for about a year after ending her engagement to Canadian billionaire James Packer.
"We're together when it counts," Carey told ET at her Butterfly MC Records launch event on Tuesday when asked about their relationship. "We're together for the kids, and I think that's the most important thing."
Back in February, Cannon welcomed another child, two-month old son Golden, with former Miss Arizona, Brittany Bell.

The superstar musician tweeted on Wednesday (May 3), following news of the planned American Health Care Act vote, encouraging his followers to get engaged: "Stop #Trumpcare. Save Lives. Call your rep today!"
He continued, "House GOP literally voting to let people die. This sounds hyperbolic but it isn't. Make them regret this vote."
Legend then turned his attention to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, accusing him of lying about the new healthcare bill constantly. He joked that Ryan would surely wait for the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to releases a report on the expected impacts of the bill, when all signs point that he will do no such thing.

Tomlin, always quick with a quip, asked if the audience even knew who Hollywood royalty Fonda was. "No, they didn't know who I was," replied Fonda. "I wouldn't be here alive today if they did." That, believe it or not, was not even the most bizarre part of Jane's Music City getaway. "But then we went on her tour bus and one of the first stops was at her cousin's still in the Ozarks because she wanted me to know what really good white lightning was," Fonda continued, explaining to Corden that Parton's cousin filtered his moonshine an extra time for more goodness.
When in the Ozarks... Fonda plugged her thumb in the jug and took a swig. "I didn't know I was drunk!" she said. "I was drunk for 10 days and didn't know it."

"I love Jill, and she's obviously part of the reason the show is as successful as it is. "
© 2017  AOL Inc.
Good grief! Let me get this straight -- she dated the dude for a whole 10 years, and not once did he manage to give her the big O? Gah. No wonder she never bothered saying "I love you" to him. (I mean ... 10 years?!?)
And while you gotta give Raven mad props for putting it all out there and being open and honest with Nick, who else thinks her plan most likely backfired miserably as far as the fantasy suite is concerned?
Think about it for a second. It would put enough pressure on a guy to tell him that you'd only slept with one other person -- but then to go so far as to tell him that the sex totally sucked? Um ... no pressure. (Not even a little bit.)
Come on. Did you catch the look on Nick's face after she told him that?
And it's hard not to wonder what actually went down (no pun intended) once the cameras left their little igloo in the snow. Did they do the deed? Was it good? And most importantly, did Nick manage to make her toes curl in pure ecstasy? (Eh, I wouldn't bet on it.)
Ohhhh, and what about the guy she used to date? Man. I'll bet that dude wants to hide under a rock right about now. Nothing quite says "f*** you" like going on national television and telling the world that someone was so awful in the sack that he still couldn't manage to hit the right spot after a decade. (Dude. Get it together.)

CafeMom recently caught up with the Lauritas to discuss the progress they've seen in Nicholas, now 7; how this journey has forever changed their family (the couple also has a 14-year-old son named CJ, and Jacqueline has a 26-year-old daughter named Ashley from a previous marriage); the setbacks they've endured; and the hope they wish to inspire in other families with children on the autism spectrum.
How's Nicholas doing these days?
It's been amazing, I've been waiting for this. He's definitely way more engaged with his family and is very loving. He loves giving hugs and kisses.
How has this journey changed your family?
CJ [Jacqueline and Chris's teenage son] has become an amazing person, and I think Nicholas has had a lot to do with it. He's so patient, caring, and loving. I'm really looking forward to watching CJ grow and become a caring person who leads with compassion. 
We're happy with the outcome and filmed a whole lot more with Nicholas than people got to see. But I think [what aired] was enough to help raise awareness and make some noise. I can't even tell you how many times people have told me, "Because of you, I got my child tested." It's so satisfying to hear that what we did [and what we're doing] is helping other people.
What are some of the common misconceptions you think people have about autism -- or that you think people just get wrong?
My son Nicholas is extremely bright. He has a photographic memory that inspires me to find ways to use this gift to help teach him things. Because he has a photographic memory, I would take pictures of things in his environment and put words on them. He ended up learning the words and not just memorizing the pictures.
How has being the parents of an autistic child changed you as a couple?
There are times when I'll walk into the house and see Jacqueline is having a rough time and I'll say, "Hey, look, I'm going to take him in the car for a drive." I'll take him out of the house for an hour or half-hour driving -- which is something he loves to do -- just so I know the heat is off her so I can do what I can to help. And it works the other way, too. Sometimes I'll say, "Jac, I need a break" and will go for a drive or go downstairs and ...
What advice do you have for families with a child on the spectrum?
I have to say for the parents [who are raising a child on the spectrum], this might not be the journey that you expected to have with your child. It's a different journey, but is still a wonderful journey. You have just as many joys. Nicholas brings us so much joy -- we're constantly giggling at the things he says. We're still enjoying our child. 
If you had to look back at Jacqueline and Chris at the beginning of this journey, what advice would you give your former selves?
What advice do you have for parents who don't have a child on the autism spectrum?

The gossip site speculated that it was Jenelle who said, "It something isn't broke, why fix it? The show is doing beyond well." Another reportedly said, "It's the most bizarre move MTV has ever made. They are jumping the shark!"
There's a rumor going around that Briana will replace Chelsea (Houska) DeBoer, who has publicly voiced in recent seasons her desires to live a more private life. She and Cole didn't even allow MTV to film their engagement or wedding.
However, a source close to the mom of two said, "Chelsea has a great producer now, and has been able to avoid most of the chaos that MTV likes to push."
Drama may be exactly what MTV is hoping to accomplish if they are indeed bring DeJesus on board. She and Jenelle have gotten into frequent feuds on social media over the years, and could certainly come to blows on a reunion special or something, like Amber Portwood and Farrah Abraham did last season.
So far nothing has been confirmed about Briana even joining the cast, and the whole thing seems a bit far-fetched. But we can only imagine the shakeup that would happen if she did. After all, she's already bringing the drama, and she's not even an official cast member yet.

When I graduated from college, I was thrilled to get a job in my field and start making some money. I had been living like the broke college student I was and driving a 15-year-old clunker of a car. So, when an older friend told me I needed to upgrade my car to "look professional," I believed her. Boy, was that stupid. 
Two days after graduation, I went and bought myself a brand-new car with a $17,000 price tag. I thought I got a pretty good deal on it, since my interest rate was only 8 percent, and my payments would be around $300 a month. I was too young to realize that 8 percent wasn't anything to brag about, and that a $300 car payment on a monthly paycheck of just over $1,500 was going to be a problem.
A few months later, my student loan payments started, and I found myself in a situation where 3/4 of my take-home pay was going to my car, my rent, and my student loans. I was, to use some technical language, financially screwed.

Although there have been courtship rumors about Jana for years (remember when she was supposedly dating Tim Tebow?), fans seem eager for a pairing between Jim Bob and Michelle's oldest daughter, and the aspiring musician. 
Unfortunately, the Bates family shot down the rumors before we could really start wondering when we'd see a ring on Jana's finger. According to the Bates Family Blog (which is run by friends of the family), Kelly shared, "I think that probably Lawson and Jana would both be shocked by that news, although we have heard that rumor. They are very good friends but no courtships that either of our families are aware of."
Fans won't stop shipping them though, and have speculated that they're just taking their time so Lawson can get his music career off the ground. One anonymous comment on the blog post read, "I believe it is true but he is concentrating on his career at the moment so is holding off announcing anything yet. That's what I think anyway. I love them both they would make a beautiful couple."
Beuatiful couple or not, we are going to take Mama Bates's word on this -- Jana and Lawson are not a couple. At least not yet.

No more Twitter for Kanye.
"He's focusing on getting back into the public spotlight really slow," a source told ET earlier this week. "That's the main reason why he didn't want to go to the Met Ball. He's still very close friends with Anna and loves her dearly, but right now it's all about him and staying healthy."

Beyonce is setting the record straight on a report speculating that she got a cosmetic procedure done while pregnant with twins.
"What do you know about the effects of pregnancy on a woman's entire body? Please tell me," the statement reads, addressing the staffers at the website directly. "Did you know that in addition to weight gain there is often a dramatic change in the blood flow in the system and increased fluid causing swelling? Do you know that often women's gums get swollen? Do you know that it sometimes affects our speech, our ability to chew intently and a host of other things?"

"I stood silent during Beyonce's first pregnancy when you thought it was okay to bully her like the cowards you are, when you accused her of never being pregnant, but I simply cannot this time."
The statement ends with some even harsher words. "You are the saddest individuals and picking on a pregnant lady is tantamount to possessing the coldest, despicable heart," Noel-Schure says. "You need to find something else to do with your time and maybe stop by a store that has happiness on sale because you need to buy some.

So, last week’s episode — We left off with Richard trying to sympathize with Patrick, although he’s clearly still in love with [the blonde] Maddie. He tried to warn Patrick about how he was going to get played [OR SO WE THOUGHT], and he followed him to work. Well, work turned out to be the FBI. SO, the tables have turned. The episode had a bombshell ending, with Patrick actually meeting his sister, Gina, and Auntie Colleen — two other FBI employees. At this point we’re so mind-f–ked that we can’t even collect our thoughts.
What better way to cap off our excitement than go right to the source — Stephen Bishop, aka sultry, sweet, mysterious Patrick. “I loved how everyone went from feeling bad for Patrick to, he who we perceived to being played, is actually the player,” Stephen told us. In case you guys didn’t know, he actually live-Tweets the show, so you may just get to chat with the charming actor.
Although we see Patrick every Tuesday night, we had to ask Stephen how he would describe him. “I can describe Patrick in one word,” he said. ” — Sharp.” Such a clutch word for what we’re seeing now…
As for what’s in store for us? — “You’re going to see more of that [sharpness]. Now Patrick is about to switch gears. Now we’re going to see him in his real element, as opposed to the lovey-dovey boyfriend-y guy. He’s a sharp tack.”
“I’ve been getting that a lot,” he admitted. “David isn’t dead so there’s always the chance he could come back… I’m really hoping that at some point they bring them back together… You never know what’s going to happen.” Fingers crossed!

“Don’t get me wrong — the Kardashian girls love each other, but there is a definite rivalry,” the insider confessed. We know the sisters are as close as they come and have always supported each other through thick and thin, but we also know that even the strongest sibling bonds can be tested when it comes to who is “better” at something. So if Khloe currently holds the title of “hottest” sister, thanks to her determination to get that killer “revenge body,” she might have to deal with a little bit of drama between her and Kim!

In the early '90s, Courtney Love and other grunge queens reinvented the slip dress, taking it from the privacy of the bedroom to center stage — literally — where Love flaunted the look with her Dr. Martens.
Twenty years later, as the '90s aesthetic resurfaces in popular culture once again, Love's "kinderwhore" look has filtered down to mall stores like Urban Outfitters, Forever21 and Zendaya's Daya collection.

Back in September, American Airlines celebrated the finalization of its merger with US Airways by debuting updated uniforms for 70,000 of its customer-facing employees, including pilots, flight attendants and customer service representatives.
In some cases, employees have reported reactions so severe that they required medical attention. Joshua Scarpuzzi, a flight attendant, told CBS that his eyes swelled shut and he was admitted to the ER after suffering a reaction to the clothing.

The airline is now working on a case-by-case basis to assist those affected employees, offering several alternatives to the offending uniforms, including a new edition released this spring, a 100 percent cotton option and, in select cases, the choice to purchase look-alike items from other retailers.
However, for some employees, these options aren't good enough. They insist that a full recall is the only way to remedy the situation. "I'm still next to people who are wearing the uniform," said Scarpuzzi. "When I sit on my jump seat, I try to give a couple inches of space between me and the other person because my first trip back after my ER visit I got a rash, just from sitting next to someone wearing it."
Foster notes that a recall is not being considered by the airline.

A Jerusalem-based Fox News employee is suing the network for discrimination and retaliation, following up on a statement made to European regulators that more litigation was coming by attorney who is representing more than a dozen clients against the network.
Jessica Golloher is a Fox News Radio correspondent in the Middle East and North Africa, and says she was notified within 24 hours of requesting via email an opportunity to speak with the network's independent investigator that her contract would not be renewed upon its August expiration.
"While Fox may claim that the decision to terminate Ms. Golloher was made before she sent the email on April 17, 2017, any such defense would be preposterous given that Ms. Golloher had previously complained about discriminatory treatment and she was provided no notice or warning whatsoever regarding any potential termination," writes attorney Douglas Wigdor.
Golloher claims she was marginalized because of her gender. She had been based in Moscow in 2013, working as the network's Russia correspondent, but when the Sochi Olympic Games approached they gave the lead reporting gig to a London-based male colleague instead of her. Golloher says she was told to act as Simon Owen's Russian translator and help in his reporting.

"Aware of Fox's blatant marginalization of her skills and its decision to promote a man as the voice of Fox during the Olympics, Ms. Golloher complained throughout the Sochi events about her discriminatory treatment and the fact that she was downgraded to 'secretarial' status for Mr. Owen's purposes," writes Wigdor in the complaint.
The correspondent also claims she was bumped to the late reporting shift and forced to cover "the ridiculous and frivolous 'panty protests'" following a ban on the import of lacy underwear, instead of covering "serious and relevant" news.
In another example, set two years later, Golloher says she complained to her superiors that an anchor-producer colleague was making "relentless edits" to her scripts and treating her like a "vapid, unintelligent female reporter."
Earlier this year, Golloher says she pitched a story that would require her to go to Afghanistan but was rejected because it was "exceedingly unsafe." She claims that shortly thereafter the network sent a male reporter to cover the exact story she had pitched.

She says she was informed she was being terminated because of "budgetary concerns."
"Since she has been informed of her termination, Ms. Golloher continues to be excluded from work assignments," writes Wigdor. "Moreover, freelance colleagues are being given assignments that are entirely within Ms. Golloher's area of expertise despite the fact that she is still on Fox's payroll."
Golloher is suing Fox News, its parent 21st Century Fox, VP of Fox News Radio Mitch Davis and Director of News Programming Hank Weinbloom for gender discrimination and retaliation.
"Mr. Wigdor's allegation regarding his client Jessica Golloher is without merit," a Fox representative said in a statement Wednesday. "Any suggestion of discrimination or retaliation is baseless. We will vigorously defend the matter." The company has not yet commented further on the matter now that the lawsuit has been filed.

Read: Up in Smoke: How Some Stars Broke All the Rules at the Met Gala
Cameras captured Culkin helping the 19-year-old light a cigarette before heading to Paris Blues, a jazz club in Harlem.
The duo are said to have left the spot at about 4 a.m.
Culkin, 36, and his goddaughter have a very close bond. The actor and her father were seemingly inseparable in the early 1990s.
After the "Billie Jean" singer's sudden death in 2009, the actor was there to show support for his grieving children.
Now, with her star on the rise — she reportedly just signed a multi-million dollar deal with Calvin Klein — she'll have her godfather by her side as she handles life in the spotlight.

Sarah had been sent out to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles wearing an 'Anna' costume, tasked with finding a masked 'Kristoff' on the street.
"Now to make things more dramatic, Sarah and Michael have never been on a date before," Bell said while Sarah was out searching. "Sarah has no idea Michael is asking her to prom. This could go terribly wrong, but you've got to admit it would make great TV, right?"

Sarah interrupted at that point, giggling as she grabbed the mic and said, "Yes!"

Since the badly decomposed bodies of Drew DeVoursney annd Francesca Matus were discovered in a cane field in the tiny Central American country on Monday, speculation about why they were killed had centered on potential larceny.
However, Belize investigators said Thursday that whoever killed the 36-year-old Atlanta native and his 52-year-old girlfriend did not take his wallet or her jewelry.
"It seems the motive was not theft," Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said. "Several persons have been questioned. Persons have been detained."
However, no one has been charged in the murders, leaving DeVoureny's mother with nothing left to do but sit at home wondering why someone took away her son.
But strangling was, indeed, the cause cited in both deaths. The bodies were found approximately five days after they were dumped in a field with duct tape around their wrists.
The couple had last been seen leaving a bar in Corozal on April 25.
DeVoursney had been dating Matus for a few months and was expected to fly home to Georgia this week. The couple was reported missing when a friend of Matus' went to pick her up at her home last week.
DeVoursney's bicycle was found in Matus' driveway, but her vehicle was missing. That vehicle was later found in a cane field 10 miles from the bar where they were last seen, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
As the investigation into the crime continues, a friend of DeVoursney's and fellow Marine has made it his personal mission to help the veteran's family find peace.
"I met my best friend, Drew Devoursney, while serving in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 with 1st Marines. After that, he went back for another tour in Iraq with 11th Marines. Then he served as a contractor in Afghanistan," wrote Brand Barfield in a GoFundMe that he started when the couple first went missing.
Barfield has since accompanied Devourney's brother to Belize where they successfully helped prevent Belizean authorities from cremating the bodies before U.S. investigators could arrive to conduct their own investigation.
According to Barfield and Devoursney's family, FBI officials have arrived in Belize to aid in the search for answers.

"I'm a really big pet lover," 18-year-old Brenda Sierra of Tampa told InsideEdition.com. "I try to share every moment with her so I wanted to bring her with me to take pictures for prom. I wanted her to get dressed up and I had the extra fabric, so I made the dress for her."
"I love getting her dressed up and she's very tolerant with it," Sierra said, mentioning that her pup has a mini closet of outfits within her own. "She doesn't mind it. She doesn't chew it off or pick at it."

And, it was clearly a blast since pictures of herself, Sasha and her date Rodney Sesler in matching outfits went viral almost immediately, even though the pup didn't actually get to attend the dance with them.

            The longtime singer-songwriter on the March for Science, aliens, fake news, and rock against ignorance
      
        
There’s reason to believe I might have gotten one of my childhood idols arrested this week.
And through it all, they’ve shared a mutual love and respect for science, starting when they each stumbled across the original recording of “Why Does the Sun Shine?” in grammar school, later to become a well-loved tour standard that spawned an updated recorded version. 
Fact: They Might Be Giants are the first band I can recall hearing, age 4 or 5. 
Fact: They Might Be Giants are fucking awesome … scientifically speaking.
MTV News: They Might Be Giants have been a band for what you would call, if you measure it in metric, "a really, really, really fucking long time."
So the March For Science was last weekend...
How long did you and John Linnell know each other before you realized that you shared a mutual interest in science?
So we've done science songs. We've done historical songs. A lot of people would like us to do [more] historical songs. Our history record would probably be like the people's history of the United States, set to music.
Parents love these records, too.
Faith can't heal the ozone layer.
To your point, sometime in the history of you guys covering “Why Does the Sun Shine?” we learned more about the sun than we knew at the time the song was written, so you wrote another, updated version. So your music shows that science is a self-correcting study, and that it needs to be updated occasionally.
So, They Might Be Giants is fake news, thanks for telling me now.
What do you think bands can do to be effective in terms of raising awareness around science and other causes? 
It sucks to think about, honestly, but when you really consider the resources that it takes to press vinyl records, or the amount of gas that it takes to tour, it's really quite scary. 
That's one thing about Dial-A-Song — at least it was a low-impact project.
On the subject of lying… Is extraterrestrial life real? Because for me, aliens are space, and space is the environment also.
Oh, aliens are a faith-based project now?
I had zero intentions of asking you that question. It just popped into my mind that I'd be sad if I got off this call without finding out how you feel about aliens.
A lot of people seem to think aliens can heal climate change, that alien technology is what’s going to save us.
There's so much ingenuity — the simplest app on your smartphone requires 40 peoples’ purest imagination. The challenges with people on environment, we just have to open some of that creativity. But I don't think it's necessarily about heating clouds or enormous chemical changes in the atmosphere. The main thing that we're doing is thinking we can control anything, which is the biggest false assumption we can make. I think we can figure out how to tread a lot more lightly on the environment, and we'll be a lot better off. 
What topics have you not tackled yet in science that you feel like you could or even hypothetically would want to write about?
It just brings me back to reading all the reviews saying, “My kid is obsessed with this album and apparently I needed a refresher course too.” If anyone could really permeate at a few levels of culture, I think it could be you guys. Maybe you should occupy Congress with your accordion.

            In his new documentary, the rapper sheds light on the Southern black experience
      
        
When he does decide to pipe up, he speaks from settings that reimagine the places we’ve already traversed. Every major stop in the film is accompanied by an interlude of J. Cole performing his songs amid subtly fantastical scenery. The forested outskirts of Missouri, when he performs “Ville Mentality,” are touched by psychedelic pastel tints that turn Cole's skin the color of seaweed and the sky the color of grapefruit flesh. “Immortal” is shot in the security office of a motel building where the caretaker has seen murders, robberies, and assaults take place; Cole himself zaps onto the security camera, pantomiming the wild occurrences those cameras have recorded over time, before finishing his performance in the laundry room.
As the film travels from Baton Rouge to Atlanta and Ferguson, to Cole's home in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and to his parents' home in Jonesboro, Arkansas, he leaves much of the narrative heavy lifting to his unnamed subjects. The documentary opens with a young black woman from Ferguson praising the artist for the way he uses his platform (”We need more people like J. Cole, with a voice”), but he rarely speaks up directly for any one topic. Instead, he opts to show us black folks telling their own stories of self-determination, survival, and the psychological toll of non-recognition from the outside world. 
Later, in Fayetteville, a young man looking over project row houses quips, “A real muhfucka gotta know how to survive to make it out here.” There are rules, however unspoken, to continuing on in this life as both black and forgotten. Another unnamed subject in Fayetteville — this time the Tropical Motel property manager seen in "Immortal" — tells Cole of the violent and spectacular circumstances he’s seen as well as how and why he’s able to continue on: “You’ve got to have a passion for people.” 
When Cole returns home to Jonesboro, his father tells the story of the black women who started the Craighead community center, which houses the most complete black historical archive in the town. Old school portraits flash in front of the screen as we hear how unfathomably dedicated to their communities these women were and, probably, still are. As it plays out in the film, it seems that engaging with adult black women is a matter of coincidence and not a seeking-out.

            Twenty years of dancing to ‘Time After Time’
      
        
Which is but one example of a single fact: The 1990s were a golden age of pop-culture nostalgia, especially through the delightfully versatile medium of movie soundtracks.
Lauper's 1983 ballad recurs in the movie as a subtle way of charting the evolution of Romy and Michele as people. We’re first introduced to the track while the two dance together after realizing Billy abandoned Romy at prom. Two hours into the film, however, their dance is different: With our heroines joined this time by fellow A-Team reject Sandy, the Lauper song morphs into an anthem of liberation. By the film’s end, none of them want or need the approval of Tucson High's alums, and they prove this by dancing the way they want to a song that once defined one of the saddest nights of their teen lives.
As all Cyndi Lauper songs should be danced to, TBQH.

A daily cup of joe adds up if you purchase it at places like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. Save by brewing at home.
It's a tough addiction to beat, but it is a very expensive to purchase cigarettes daily. Aside from causing deadly health effects, according to Time, smoking can cost you $1 to $2 million in a lifetime. Make an effort to better your health and wallet.
If your area doesn't charge for using plastic bags, reuse the ones you get from shopping as garbage bags. I do this all the time.
For those living in an area where stores charge for plastic bags (*cough cough Chicago*), bring your own reusable one. Those cents add up!
Reuse bags from previous occasions if they are still in good condition. We started doing this last year and no longer have to run out and by $3+ gift bags when we go to events or parties.
Take some time to make your own personal cards or send an eCard and skip on the expense.
For the frequent traveler, you should buy empty travel containers and refill with shampoo, lotion, etc. as needed.
Save money and paper by keeping up with free online news services.
In the digital age of music, don't pay for premium services. Streaming companies like SoundCloud and Spotify allow you to listen to music for free.
If you'd like to truly own a book, then save on the paper and extra cost by purchasing the digital version, or go to your local library and check them out for free.
Remember to return all materials on time. It'll save you money and allow for other library patrons to enjoy the material in a timely manner. If you do have library fees, wait for a month when they accept canned goods as a payment method (usually around the holidays).
Skip the early release and commotion of having the latest video game. Save major bucks by purchasing a used version of the game online or at stores like Game Stop.
Gaming apps are meant to entertain, and while most of them are free, don't fall for the "purchase bonus lives" trap. In-game purchases add up.
If you forget your charger and your phone needs to be charged, some time you'll be inclined to purchase a new one, but it can be costly or even poor quality. Always keep your charger handy, look for a charging station where you're at, or simply ask to borrow one.
Save on disposable batteries and purchase rechargeable ones. They can last up to two to three years.
Many offices, banks, insurance companies, etc, give them away for free. Save them and skip on the purchase.
Unless you're a student, you probably don't really need to buy a lot of paper – reuse already printed pages and use both sides.
While some families "grow into" their homes, sometimes less is more. Save on mortgage and the possibility of purchasing more for a larger home. Downsize and save.
If you pay for water utility bill, according to the EPA, fixing leaky faucets saves you 10% on your bill. By ignoring it, you not only lose money every day it goes unfixed, but you also waste clean water, at a rate of 10,000 gallons per year.
Save on heating and electric bills by fixing drafts and keep the warmth and cool in your home during the winter and summer.
Even though you may not use them often, electronics that are plugged in still consume energy. Unplug appliances you don't you often and keep other electronics on a power strip, turning them off when not in use.
Improve your health and wallet by not eating fast food often. It may be cheap, but it adds up, especially if you eat out a few times per week. Instead, spend the money and the time to grocery shop and prepare meals.
Sometimes you're running late for work and don't have time to pack a lunch. Buying lunch often costs much more than preparing and bring a meal to work. Spend some time planning, purchasing and preparing meals ahead of time so they're ready to go, even when you're in a hurry.
When you do go grocery shopping, sometimes the already-prepped sub or diced fruits and veggies tempt you to buy them and save time, but you'll be paying top dollar for those products. Plan a list ahead of time and buy the individual food items, then spend the time prepping them yourself in order to save.
Save money by skipping on the brand names, like medicine, toiletries, and certain foods. Remember that healthier options with fewer additives may cost more and in that case they may be worth it. Otherwise, generic is the way to go.
Products like toilet paper and soap have a long shelf life, so save on purchasing those often and buy in bulk.
You are purchasing these to eventually throw them out. Save on the waste and save money by buying reusable, washable towels and napkins. Your wallet and the environment will thank you.
Primetime showings are typically 2x higher than those during the day. Go to morning matinees or take advantage of weekly specials ($5 movie nights during the week).
Often times, movie theater food can cost more than the ticket to get in. Try to keep food purchases to a minimum when you can or eat a filling meal before you go see a movie.
Instead of spending money on purchasing the movie, subscribe to streaming services and find an alternative or go to your local library.
While having a spontaneous night out is fun, if you RSVP when possible, arrive early, or take advantage of online ticket sales, you can skip out on paying in full at your favorite nightlife places.
Your birthday is one of the best days to score free stuff like meals, drinks, desserts, tickets, services, etc. I wrote a whole roundup post on birthday freebies a while ago.
When you do dine out and if you have kids with you, be sure to take advantage of 'kids eat free' specials. Most restaurants have specific days of the week when they offer free kids meals.
You may not be able to cut out this expense completely if you have pets, but you can score free cans of pet food with coupons occasionally so you won't have to spend as much.
As you can see, there are many ways to save big on everyday expenses. How do you plan on cutting back and keeping more money in your wallet?

Kids go through all kinds of interesting stages in life. I find it interesting, and a bit entertaining, that my 7-year-old is now in that state where he's having conversations with his friends about more than just toys.
I can understand many of the reasons why parents start paying their child an allowance. It can help:
However, something inside me just wasn't buying it. I decided not to give my child an allowance for now. Here are 3 reasons why along with what I opted to do instead.
Right now, there's not a ton that my 7-year-old can do around the house. My husband and I do the cooking and cleaning. All my son needs to do is pick up his toys after himself, and make up his bed each day.
I've tried teaching him how to hang up his clothes and vacuum a bit, but he's not doing these things on a regular basis. Regardless, all of these chores listed are things he can do to help out and contribute to the family.
I don't think he should get paid for normal things he does around the house since because that could set him up for unrealistic expectations later on in life. My husband and I don't get paid to cook dinner and clean up the house.
My child is in a stage right now where he's interested in having money – to buy toys I'm guessing. He's not necessarily interested in doing his chores and helping out around the house. He's just looking forward to what's in it for him.
I actually see that as a bad sign. I don't want my son to be motivated to do things just for money.
There are many other benefits that come from doing chores and cleaning up, like having a neat home or room to enjoy, and avoiding clutter and pests that may show up when there are a ton of crumbs around.
I fear that if I start paying my child an allowance this early, he may not be motivated to help out and clean in general in the future if money isn't involved. It's important to teach my son that cleaning up is a natural habit that everyone should be happy to do regardless of if they're getting paid or not.
Some parents may argue that paying your child an allowance can help them learn about money. Without having money of their own how can they learn how to manage money properly? I don't entirely agree with this mindset.
Right now, I know that my son wants money so he can buy extra toys (that he doesn't really need). My husband and I get him plenty for Christmas and his birthday, and my mom gets him things occasionally.
Sure, I could probably give him a small allowance. Then I could teach him how to save a portion of the money instead of spending it. But, I can also teach him how to budget for real life expenses too.
I'm planning on giving him a budget for his birthday party next year. I'll let him pick everything out so I can actively show him how much things cost. I can also teach him about budgeting while we shop for food in the grocery store instead of just doing everything myself.
We can also discuss saving up for college. Plus, I really want to get him a stock gift card for Christmas so I can introduce investing.
Instead, I'm willing to give him money for going above and beyond my expectations. For example, if he were to get straight As in school in future years. I'm also okay with helping him collect spare change that's found around the house as an attempt to 'grow his savings'.
My husband and I are really bad about leaving spare change around and doing absolutely nothing with this. A few weeks ago, we decided to allow our son to put some of the spare change from around the house into his bank.
Quarters are off limits because we tend to use those for washing our clothes. But, as long as I approve it, anything else is fair game for his piggy bank. My hope is that collecting spare change will teach my son how to be resourceful in future years. He'll understand that all money is valuable and can add up.
Right now since my child has very few needs and plenty of time to learn more about money. I feel like this is the best solution for us.

Paying taxes on Earth is already a pain, but in California, you could one day be paying that extra fee in space. The state's franchise tax board wants the public to weigh in on the idea.
Its proposal would compute taxes on commercial space transportation companies. Basically, any company operating in California that makes half of their money from space transportation. They say it is any travel 62 miles above the surface of the Earth.
Alabama residents pay less in property taxes than residents in any other state due to low median home values and the second-lowest property tax rate. Alabama residents have 23.66 percent of income going toward taxes, with a median household income of $44,509.
Arizona falls in the bottom half of states for total taxes paid by its residents, who see 24.58 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes. Property taxes and gas taxes paid in this state are lower than the national average.
Arkansas has one of the highest sales tax rates in the nation, at 9.3 percent. However, residents pay less in income taxes and gas taxes than the national average. Plus, the average property tax bill in Arkansas is among the lowest in the nation due to low median home values and a low tax rate.
California residents pay more in taxes than residents of most other states. In fact, 31 percent of their income, on average, goes toward taxes. Considering that the cost of living in California also is high, it's no wonder it's one of the states where residents are most likely to live paycheck to paycheck, according to one GOBankingRates study.
Colorado residents pay more in taxes than the national average of $14,998.83 — and pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes, on average. The reason: high income and sales taxes. Gas and property taxes paid in Colorado, on th other hand, are lower than the national average.
Connecticut residents pay more in income taxes than any other state, in part due to a high median income of $72,889. Average property taxes paid in the state also are about double the national average of $2,118.08. In addition to high taxes, residents also are faced with a high cost of living in Connecticut.
Delaware is one of the most tax-friendly states, with residents paying just 21.99 percent of their income toward taxes. One of the key reasons the total tax bill is low here is because there is no sales tax. Plus, the average property tax paid is nearly half the national average.
Washington, D.C., residents pay more in property taxes, on average, than residents in most states due to a high median home value of $540,400. Residents also pay more in income taxes, on average, than any other state, with the exception of Connecticut.
On the plus side, the sales tax rate of 5.75 percent is below the national average. Residents also pay less than the national average to fill up their gas tanks.
The total taxes paid in Georgia are lower than the national average of $14,998.83. However, taxes actually consume a higher percentage of residents' income than the national average because of a low median income of $50,768 in the state.
Hawaii residents have to pay a hefty tax bill to live in paradise. Total taxes paid are among the top 10 highest in the nation — due, in large part, to high income taxes. Residents earning a median household income of $64,514 pay around $14,798.36 in income taxes.
On the plus side, property and sales taxes in Hawaii are lower than the national average.
Total taxes paid in Idaho — $14,012.17 — are slightly below the national average. However, residents pay a higher percentage of their income toward taxes than the national average due to the state's low median income.
Hefty property and sales taxes contribute to a high total tax bill in Illinois. In fact, the average property tax bill is more than 50 percent higher than the national average — even though the median home value is below the national average. Overall, Illinois residents pay nearly 30 percent of their income, on average, toward taxes.
Indiana is a relatively tax-friendly state. The average total tax bill is lower than the national average because income and property taxes are lower in Indiana than in most other states.
Average property taxes paid in Kansas are relatively low due to a less-than-stellar median home value. Average income taxes paid also are below the national average because of the state's low median wage. However, Kansas residents are hit by a high sales tax, which is 8.62 percent versus the national average 6.47 percent.
Kentucky has the fourth-lowest average tax burden in this study. All taxes paid — income, sales, property and gas — are well below the national average. Income and property taxes paid are particularly low, on average, due to the state's low median income and property value.
Average property taxes paid in Louisiana are among the lowest in the nation, as are income taxes due to the state's low median income of $45,922. Further, Louisiana has a higher-than-average sales tax of 9.98 percent.
Total taxes paid in Maine are lower than the national average. But that doesn't mean residents don't face high taxes. Total taxes paid consume nearly 27 percent of residents' pay, on average, due to the state's low median income.
Maryland residents pay more in taxes than residents in all but three states. This is largely due to the high income taxes paid in this state, which has the third-highest median income in the nation.
Michigan's property tax rate is higher than the national average. However, a low median home value helps keep down the average property taxes paid in the state. Income and sales taxes paid also are lower than the national average.
On average, nearly 30 percent of what Minnesota residents earn goes toward income, property, sales and gas taxes. Average income taxes paid are particularly high, compared with other states.
Mississippi residents pay the lowest total tax bill in the nation. Income taxes paid here are the second lowest in the country due to the state's low median income of $40,037. Plus, property taxes paid are among the lowest in the nation as a result of a low tax rate and median home value.
The total tax bill in Missouri is only slightly higher than the national average of $14,998.83, due to income and sales taxes that are higher than the average paid nationwide. However, property and gas taxes in Missouri are well below the national average paid.
Montana is just one of four states with no sales tax. Property and income taxes also are lower than the national average. As a result, Montana residents see just 22.28 percent of their income, on average, go toward taxes.
The total tax bill in Nebraska is higher than the national average. In large part, it's because residents pay more in income taxes as a result of a higher-than-average median income. Nonetheless, residents pay, on average, an amount equal to about 28 percent of their income.
New Hampshire has no sales tax. It also doesn't have a state income tax, but the average amount of federal income taxes paid by residents is high because the state has the highest median income in the nation. Residents also pay more in property taxes than the national average paid. In fact, New Hampshire has the second-highest property tax rate in the U.S., after New Jersey.
New Jersey residents pay the highest total tax bill in the nation. They also pay the highest percentage of income toward taxes — 33.17 percent, on average. The biggest reason the tax burden is so high in New Jersey is the state's 2.13 percent property tax rate, which is more than twice as high as the national average rate.
Total taxes paid in New Mexico are among the lowest in the nation. Property and income taxes paid are well below the national average. This is due, in large part, to a low median income and a low median home value in the state.
Like their New Jersey neighbors, New York residents pay more than 30 percent of their income toward taxes. Residents pay a lot on the state's high sales tax of 8.49 percent and property tax of 1.38 percent.
The total tax bill in North Carolina is lower than the national average thanks to lower-than-average property and income taxes. However, residents pay more in gas taxes.
North Dakota residents have a lower total tax bill than the national average, paying around $13,381.61 every year. Gas and property taxes are lower than the national average, too.
Although the property tax rate in Ohio is higher than the national average, property taxes paid fall below the national average due to the state's low median home value of $125,300. Ohio residents also pay slightly less in income taxes overall, forking over just under $9,000 annually.
Oklahoma has one of the lowest total tax bills in the nation. Income and property taxes are well below the national average because median income and the median home value are among the lowest in the U.S. However, residents are hit by a high 8.86 percent state sales tax.
Oregon is just one of four states without a sales tax. Still, residents pay just over 28 percent of their income toward taxes. They face a high income tax bill.
Rhode Island residents pay over 29 percent of their income toward taxes. The big tax bite is due primarily to the state's high property tax rate of 1.51 percent. Income and sales taxes, on the other hand, are on par with the national average.
South Carolina's total tax bill is among the lowest in the nation. Residents pay below-average income, gas and property taxes. Its sales tax, however, is above average at 7.22 percent.
South Dakota has no income tax, which helps keep residents' total tax bill below the national average. Property and sales taxes paid also are slightly below the national average.
Tennessee has no state taxes on income, but it makes up for it with a high sales tax rate of 9.46 percent — the second highest in this study. The average property taxes paid, on the other hand, are half the national average.
The overall tax bill in Utah is higher than the national average due to high income taxes paid by residents. However, the state does offer a high median household income of about $66,000. Meanwhile, the state's property tax rate is just 0.64 percent, compared to the national average of 1.02 percent.
Vermont residents pay more in property taxes than residents in most other states. As a result, total taxes paid in this state nearly top $18,000, far higher than the national average.
Virginia residents have a higher income tax bill than the national average, paying just over $12,600. But it's due, in part, to the state's median income, which is higher than the national average. Sales, gas and property taxes are all lower than national averages.
Washington has no income tax. However, residents are liable to pay a lot in income taxes thanks to the state's high median household income of $67,243. The state sales tax is also high, at 8.92 percent.
The total tax bill in West Virginia is the second lowest in the nation, after Mississippi. The typical property tax bill is also the second lowest in the nation, due to the state's low property tax rate of 0.53 percent and a low home value of $102,400.
Wisconsin residents pay a higher overall tax bill than the national average because of the state's high income and property taxes. In fact, Wisconsin is among the top 10 states that take the most out of your paycheck.
Residents of this tax-friendly state pay only about 20 percent of their income toward taxes — the lowest percentage in the nation. Wyoming has no state income tax, and property and sales taxes in the state are well below national averages.

Now, the reason the board created the rules is to let entrepreneurs know the state's tax code will be ready once business takes off. And, figuring out the amount of tax is actually pretty simple. The farther away from Earth you go means the less tax you pay. While the closer you are means more tax.
A public hearing on the rules is set for June 16th.

Spring has finally sprung, and that means one of the hottest markets is heating up heavily — the real estate market!
An expert on all things real estate, we chatted with host of HGTV"s 'Income Property', Scott McGillivray, to get the scoop on all things spring real estate — from buying to selling to closing.
Shocking, we know: Nobody feels the urge to move during those frigid winter months.
Scott shares:
"The real estate market is most active in the spring, most transactions are occurring. It is typically more of a sellers market, meaning if you own a property, you have the upper hand right now."
Why, you ask?
"People are planning on the move — if you start looking in the spring, hopefully your property will close in the summer."
Moving in the summer means the kids are out of school, the weather is warmer, and as Scott points out:
"Most people start planning in the spring so they can make the transition in the summer and go into the fall well settled in."
So homeowners, it's time to start making moves (Literally!)
Scott asserts:
"You're already a little late if you're thinking about moving this spring."
But fear not — if you're not on a strict timeline and want to get started, there are things you can do right now to start preparing.
Watch our exclusive interview with Scott on the AOL Finance Facebook page:
Luckily, it all starts as simply as a Google search:
"If you're thinking about home ownership in any capacity, or you're thinking about transitioning from your home, the sooner you start looking the better — most people start their search online."
The best way to minimize this stress according to Scott?
Get your finances in order — or at least familiarize yourself with them:
"If you have good credit and if you have a good understanding of what kind of financing is available to you, you should be able to take a lot of stress out of the situation."
Though market trends vary geographically there are some things to be on the lookout for on a national level.
Namely, are the increase of prices urban cities and the overall affordability of home-owning getting to a challenging level, as Scott points out that many are spending more on a home than they can afford.
Another not-so-nice trend on the rise? The resurgence of bidding wars, which Scott is quick to call a "terrifying experience."
If you're looking to avoid getting yourself in the middle of said bidding war, Scott has a major tip:
"Go shopping for a property on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday — you're a lot less likely to get into a bidding war on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday than you are on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday."
Another benefit of following that schedule?
"Homes that are purchased on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays are often purchased at a lower price than those that sell on the weekends."
Scott is transparent in admitting that it's "going to become more and more difficult for new buyers to penetrate the market," as the average income isn't increasing a quickly as real estate prices are.
But if you're ready to start preparing and getting into the market, Scott suggests setting aside money for a "practice mortgage" by putting a set amount of money aside into a savings account.
Another option is to consider buying a property where you only occupy a portion of it and rent the other portion out. Scott points out that this is more affordable, and that simply "paying rent is expensive and at the end of the day you have nothing to show for it."
Renting out rooms to roommates or services like Airbnb is an easy way to make back the money you spend on buying a property (and then some!)
Scott's third tip is to use a service that will pay you back for the research you do:
We'll take it!
Scott suggests fixing the little things, like light fixtures and hardware— keeping the home general clean and de-cluttered is important.
The simpler, the better:
"Light upgrades are fantastic and typically you'll get good returns."
Painting also makes a huge difference, and Scott suggests neutral and grey tones, since they tend to have the most mass appeal.
A major tip Scott shares is to remember that the buyer has to envision themselves in your home, which means if you're trying to sell, keep the personal items to a minimum:
"Remove sofas, remove dressers and tables and clutter — give the space some room to breathe."
Less is more, so consider stowing away those hundreds of picture frames and toys laying around on the ground.
Scott points out that most people want to do big-time renovations themselves — the most important thing for a homebuyer is that the home has good bones (think electric, HVAC, plumbing, etc) and that the basics are in order.
So maybe think twice before you replace all those appliances for the sake of selling.
However if your home has gone 30 or 40 years without any sort of upgrade, it might be worth it to do a renovation.
Specifically, Scott shares that there are two rooms you should be targeting:
"The kitchen and bathrooms will give you the highest return."
It's easy to go over budget, or to overshoot your budget, when you're dead-set on finding the home of your dreams.
But Scott advises against this, and suggests a different strategy instead:
"Buy a fixer-upper, buy a distressed property — don't buy your dream home, buy the property that has the potential to be your dream home, and then you can do the work, you can renovate it over a period of time and get it to where you need it to be at a more affordable price."
If you can't buy it, create it!
1. Cut Out the Middleman
Additionally, you can save the full 5 percent to 6 percent if a buyer comes to you without representation. Without agents, you’ll save more than $16,000 on a $350,000 home sale, McGillivray said.

2. Get Your Home Listed on the MLS
“It’s tremendously important that you get on a platform that gives you exposure to buyers and agents,” McGillivray said. That platform is the Multiple Listing Service, or MLS, which is the database of homes for sale in a market. Homebuyers can see properties on the MLS through websites such as Realtor.com, Zillow.com and Trulia.com.
If you don’t get your home listed on the MLS, you’ll have to rely on classified newspaper ads, online sources such as Craigslist.org or luck to find a buyer.

3. Use Professional Signage
Listing your house on the MLS is the best way to get your property noticed by potential buyers. However, you also want to market your home well. According to McGillivray, posting a skimpy “For Sale” sign with a spot to add a phone number in your yard is “a recipe for disaster."
Instead, the real estate pro recommends having a sign professionally made. Online services such as Owners.com and ForSaleByOwner.com provide each home seller with a sturdy sign as part of the MLS listing package.

4. Get an Appraisal
McGillivray suggests hiring an appraiser to evaluate your home before putting it on the market. Doing this will help you avoid any surprises when the buyer’s lender has the house appraised to determine how much to loan. Appraisers typically charge $300 to $400, according to Realtor.com, and the price is well worth it.

5. Don't Overprice Your Home
One of the biggest mistakes home sellers make is overpricing their homes. “Everybody thinks their house is worth more than it is,” McGillivray said. “Your house is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.”
If you set the price too high, you won’t get enough traffic. On the other hand, listing your house at a realistic value means you will get more offers sooner, according to McGillivray. Ultimately, pricing your home accurately will help you sell for a better rate.
In addition to securing an appraisal, you can take advantage of information that’s available for free from online real estate listing sites. Check the list prices of comparable homes in your area and see how long they’ve been on the market. Then, consider whether your home offers more or fewer amenities than competing properties.

6. Look for Anchor Properties in Your Neighborhood
When someone posts a house for sale and lists it too high, the home becomes what McGillivray calls an anchor property. Sellers will assume that other properties in the neighborhood are better deals, if they’re listed for less.
Not only can an anchor property drive more traffic to your home, but it can also allow you to list your home at a higher price than it is actually worth. For example, if your neighbor puts his house up for sale at $600,000, and you know your property is worth $525,000, you can list it for more because it will still look like a deal next to your neighbor’s house.
So, look for overpriced homes in your area and then list your house for less.

7. Depersonalize Your Home
Before you open your doors to potential buyers, you need to depersonalize your home so someone can see himself or herself living there. For best results, remove those family photos and collectibles that might be dear to you but a turnoff to others.
“You don’t want a picture of you and your dog wearing a tuxedo hanging on the wall,” said McGillivray, who actually saw this image in a house that was for sale. “Strip it down and make it appeal to 90 percent of the population, 90 percent of the time."
Photo credit: Iriana Shiyan/Shutterstock.com
8. Make Minor Repairs
You want people to walk into a house that looks well maintained. If buyers see that you can’t take care of minor details, they’re going to assume you’ve let bigger problems escape your attention, too, McGillivray said.
Photo credit: bikeriderlondon/Shutterstock.com
9. Improve Curb Appeal
McGillivray revealed that some of the best deals he's found were properties that looked bad from the road. “People do judge a book by the cover when it comes to real estate,” he said.
By the time potential buyers reach your front door, they’ve already formed opinions about your house. For best results, spend a day — and a few hundred dollars — painting your front door, hanging new house numbers and installing updated fixtures, he said. Additionally, sellers should clean up their yards by pulling weeds and trimming shrubs.

10. Stage Your House
Professional stagers have been trained to make houses appeal to buyers by removing clutter, depersonalizing rooms, rearranging furniture and creating a "model home" feel. You can use the savings on real estate commissions to help pay for a stager so your home sells for more, faster.

11. Disclose Problems to Potential Buyers
Most states require sellers to disclose all of the home problems they're aware of. These issues include past problems, like plumbing leaks that resulted in mold growth.
Don’t try to hide anything, or you could face a lawsuit if an issue is detected after the home is sold.

12. Be Ready to Negotiate
A home's list price is a suggestion, not a rule. Said McGillivray, you shouldn’t be afraid to negotiate with buyers when they make offers on your home.
Because real estate negotiations are conducted on paper, sellers don't have to worry about confronting buyers directly. You can also negotiate on both price and terms. If you don’t want to come down much in your asking price, be flexible with your terms, such as the closing date or appliances you are willing to leave in the home for the new owner.
Owners.com and other listing services of for-sale-by-owner properties connect home sellers with licensed real estate agents who can guide them through the negotiation process.

13. Don't Make a Misstep at Closing
When you and your buyer are ready to sign on the dotted line, a mortgage lender will typically be involved. He or she will likely provide you with an escrow officer to walk you through the final steps of your home sale.

Reporters were initially seated in the back of the ballroom at the Ritz-Carlton, but as the presentation began, The Post said that a PR representative for the family asked its reporter to leave, saying that the presence of "foreign reporters threatened the 'stability' of the event." 
In one instance, event organizers grabbed a reporter's belongings, including a phone and backpack, to try to force that person out, the report said. When the event's attendees began leaving the ballroom after the presentation was over, organizers reportedly surrounded the event-goers to prevent them from talking to reporters.
When a PR rep was asked why reporters were told to leave the event, she said, "This is not the story we want." 
The presentation itself was aimed at convincing Chinese investors to put their money into Kushner 1, a real estate project in New Jersey, in order to secure investor visas, the report said.
The visas are part of the EB-5 immigrant investor visa program, which allows foreign investors to put money into job-creating projects in the US, and then apply to immigrate into the country. The future of the program, however, is uncertain given the president's campaign promise — and subsequent actions after taking office — to curb immigration into the US.

Though this event was not attended by Jared Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to President Trump, attendees were not unaware of potential benefits and concerns that may arise due to his ties to the White House. 
Wang expressed concerns that an investment in Kushner 1 could go downhill if Trump is unsuccessful. 
"We heard that there are rumors that he is the most likely to be impeached president in American history. That's why I doubt this project," Wang said.

​​​​​President Donald Trump issued his first statement on medical marijuana since he took office.
"Division B, section 537 provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories. I will treat this provision consistently with my constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed."
Tom Angell, the founder of Marijuana Majority, an advocacy group, told Business Insider he thinks that Trump's statement is the federal government's way of "asserting their right" to go after certain medical marijuana businesses if they choose to at a later date.
RELATED: Riders in the $1.1 trillion spending bill 
BANKING:
Loosens rules imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. The change relaxes regulation of high-risk investments known as "derivatives" — rules that were imposed to reduce risk to depositors' federally insured money and prevent more taxpayer bailouts. Banks said the crackdown stifled the competitiveness of the U.S. financial industry.
(Alamy)
MARIJUANA:
Offers a mixed bag for pot smokers. The bill blocks the Justice Department from raiding medical marijuana dispensaries in states that permit them. But it also blocks federal and local spending to legalize marijuana in Washington, D.C., where voters approved recreational use in a November referendum. It's unclear what the practical effect of the spending ban will be.
PENSIONS:
Allows some pension plans to cut benefits promised to current and future retirees. The change is designed to save some financially strapped plans from going broke. It applies to multiemployer plans, which cover more than 10 million people mostly at small, unionized employers, often in the construction business.
CAMPAIGN MONEY:
Allows more money to flow into political parties. Under the new rules, each superrich donor could give almost $1.6 million per election cycle to political parties and their campaign committees. The comparable limit for 2014's elections was $194,400.
OFFICIAL PORTRAITS:
Continues a ban on spending money on portraits of Cabinet secretaries, Congress members and other big shots, a Washington tradition that some lawmakers felt had gotten out of hand.
THE CAPITOL DOME:
Topping it all off, spends $21 million to continue restoration of the leaky, cracked U.S. Capitol dome.

"[M]y read is it's basically saying they reserve the right to do whatever they want and enforce prohibition regardless of the statutory prohibition on doing so," Angell said, though he doesn't think it necessarily indicates a federal crackdown on medical marijuana is coming.
Robert Capecchi, the director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in an email that Congress is growing "increasingly comfortable" with states adopting medical and recreational marijuana policies.
"Unfortunately, spending prohibitions like these expire at the end of the fiscal year, so there is still a need for a long-term solution," Capecchi added.

"If you poll the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease," Green also allegedly said in September.
Green, a Republican state senator in Tennessee and former Army medic who did three tours in Iraq, rejected the criticism, saying that the "liberal left has cut and spliced my words about terrorism and ISIS, blatantly falsifying what I've said," CNN reported.
A number of US senators also called on President Trump to choose someone else. Most were opposed due to some of Green's controversial past comments.
Green said in a statement that those who opposed him were using "false and misleading attacks."
Trump's first pick for Army secretary was business executive Vincent Viola. He withdrew his consideration in February because of his financial holdings.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has "formally requested" more information from the White House and the intelligence community on whether he was "surveilled" by the Obama administration during the presidential election, he said Friday.
"Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges?" Paul tweeted. "Did the Obama admin use warrantless "wiretapping" on other candidates besides @realdonaldtrump?
President Trump tweeted an unfounded claim in early March that President Barack Obama Obama had ordered Trump Tower phones to be "wiretapped" during the election.
See Gallery
Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Community, said later that, upon reviewing classified intelligence reports from the previous administration, he had seen no evidence that Trump was ever illegally surveilled. FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers corroborated that assessment in a March hearing before the committee.
Paul sent a letter to President Donald Trump on April 10 asking him to investigate a claim made to him by an "anonymous source" that his name was "unmasked" in intelligence reports collected under the Obama administration. He cited "revelations" that people associated with the Trump campaign had had their names unmasked as warranting an investigation into "allegations that myself and other elected members of the legislative branch may have also been unmasked."
"I ask that your administration promptly investigate whether my name or the names of other Members of Congress, or individuals from our staffs or campaigns, were included in queries or searches of databases of the intelligence community, or if their identities were unmasked in any intelligence reports or products," Paul wrote in April.
Unless Paul or his staffers were communicating with monitored foreign agents, it is unlikely their names would be unmasked by high-level Obama administration officials such as Rice, who received these intelligence reports daily.
Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizes the US intelligence community to surveil non-US persons "reasonably believed to be located outside the United States" in order to "acquire foreign intelligence information." US persons caught up in those monitored communications must have their identities "minimized," and then the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court must "review the sufficiency" of the intelligence community's minimization procedures.
The restrictions on how intelligence agencies handle "non-publicly available US person information acquired from Section 702 collection of non-US person targets" must be "consistent with the needs of the government to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information."
"The identities of US persons may be released under two circumstances: 1) the identity is needed to make sense of the intercept; 2) if a crime is involved in the conversation," said Robert Deitz, a former senior counselor to the CIA director and former general counsel at the National Security Agency.
"Any senior official who receives the underlying intelligence may request these identities," Deitz said, noting that while "the bar for obtaining the identity is not particularly high, it must come from a senior official, and the reason cannot simply be raw curiosity."
Steve Slick, a former CIA operations officer and NSC official who now heads the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said that "by definition, any report that the NSA elects to disseminate is relevant to a foreign or national-security issue."
But it is "often not possible for a consumer or reader to fully understand the significance of a report without knowing precisely which US person may have been communicating with the foreign official," he added.

Following the passage of the American Healthcare Act on Thursday, Democrats expressed outrage at House Republicans — online, in person, and at the bank.
In a joint statement released Friday, Democratic fundraising groups Daily Kos, Swing Left, and ActBlue reported that they raised a combined $2 million Thursday following the passage of the bill that would roll back President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.
"Americans are horrified that congressional Republicans just voted to take away their health care, and that's kindled real anger—anger that the Daily Kos community is channeling with record-breaking donations at unheard-of speed," Daily Kos Political Director David Nir said in a statement.

ActBlue, a service used by Democratic candidates and political action committees to streamline online fundraising, told Business Insider the organization raised over $4 million on Thursday, including $300,000 through a page specifically targeting Republicans who voted in support of the bill. (As of noon on Friday, the number had grown to over $400,000.)
Swing Left, a small grassroots organization founded after President Donald Trump's election, reported that it raised more than $150,000 in the hour after the healthcare bill and more than $800,000 on Thursday.
"Across America, grassroots Democrats are drawing a line in the sand on healthcare today and making their voices heard," ActBlue Executive Director Erin Hill said in a statement. "They're flooding their elected officials inboxes and voicemails, organizing protests and direct actions, and talking to their neighbors about what's at stake."
Official Democratic groups were more cagey about releasing fundraising totals.
A Democratic National Committee aide told Business Insider that the organization saw a "significant uptick in online donations" on Thursday, while Vice reported that the DNC had its strongest month of fundraising in over a month. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's official congressional campaign arm, flooded subscribers' inboxes with fundraising emails immediately following the vote but did not immediately disclose its fundraising totals.
While many Democrats condemned the bill's potential effects, like the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that millions more people would be uninsured over the next decade, some saw the move as a political benefit for Democrats hoping to retake the House of Representatives in 2018.
Following the passage of the bill, Democrats on the House floor chanted: "Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye," implying unpopular provisions in the bill would handicap Republicans seeking reelection next year.

 The actor resurrected his impersonation of former president George W. Bush for the event, which was held in support of the Committee to Protect Journalists. 
 "How do you like me now?" Ferrell joked in his iconic Bush twang, to huge laughs from the crowd of about 2,600. 
 "History has proven to be kinder to me than many of you thought," Ferrell said in character. "For the longest time, I was considered the worst president of all time. That has changed -- and it only took 100 days." 
 Ferrell's Bush delivered blistering remarks taking on Fox News, accusing Trump of having a "thin skin," and giving out some fashion advice. ("A big, long tie that goes past your mid-thigh does not mean what you think it means.") 
 Ferrell's appearance was a highlight on a show that didn't deviate much from Bee and "Full Frontal's" usual approach to comedy. 
 There were segments dedicated to the science of facts, CNN, a "gone too late" tribute to former Fox News figures Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes, and a piece that gave glimpses of an alternate reality in which Hillary Clinton won the presidency. 
 In an ode to Amazon's "Man in the High Castle," Bee found footage of this alternate world and watched herself give an address to Clinton at the imagined White House Correspondents' dinner. 
 The night opened with another could-be-viral piece featuring Allison Janney. In the taped segment, Janney brought back her "West Wing" character C.J. Cregg and spoke to a room of oddball bloggers in a the White House briefing room. 
 The sketch ended with Janney (as Cregg) giving a speech that admonished the purveyors of fake news. 
 "You people are monsters," Janney said. "Yes, we have freedom of speech and of press in this country and that is a beautiful thing. So if a bankrupt gang of racist bloggers, anarchists, dominionist radio hosts and rancid radio hosts want to call yourself journalists, no one can stop you. But you are part of the reason no one trusts the real press." 
 She praised real journalists who "work day and night to find the truth" and "chase down stories even when the stories put them in danger." 
 "You're ruining their reputation -- at least among people too stupid to tell the difference. You are the dregs of a free society," she said. "We have to let you exist, but we don't have to listen to you. So Samantha Bee will be spending the evening with real reporters." 
 The "Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner" special airs Saturday on TBS at 10 p.m. ET. (TBS, like CNN, is owned by Turner.) An uncensored encore version will broadcast on Twitter at 11 p.m. ET.

 And Bezos is a "mere" $7 billion behind Gates for the title of earth's richest carbon-based life form. The rankings are based on figures from both Forbes and Bloomberg. 
 The surge in Facebook's stock this year has pushed CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth up to $62.6 billion, putting him in a tie for fifth-wealthiest person with Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu. 
 And while Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't as wealthy as many of his fellow tech CEOs -- he's not a company founder -- he still is in charge of the world's most valuable company. Apple is worth three-quarters of a trillion dollars. And it has $246 billion in cash. 
 And that cash pile is steadily growing. Both Microsoft and Alphabet reported an increase in their cash levels in earnings reports Thursday. Microsoft now has $126 billion, and Alphabet has $92.4 billion. 
 Tech companies will soon have an incentive to bring a chunk of that cash back to the United States if President Trump succeeds in getting tax laws changed. He's offering a one-time tax break for companies that repatriate cash parked overseas. 
 Hopes for tax reform are one reason tech stocks continue to lead the market higher. Silicon Valley doesn't exactly see eye-to-eye with Trump on a lot of things. But investors are excited about repatriation. 
 The strong earnings don't hurt either, of course. 
 "Tech is pushing the market higher. And it's about more than Trump," said Kate Warne, an investment strategist with Edward Jones. "But Trump's policies should have a positive impact when they get implemented." 
 But should investors be worried about how much influence the tech sector has on the overall market? 
 Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are collectively worth $2.8 trillion. These companies will have to continue to innovate to maintain strong earnings and sales growth. Investors won't tolerate missteps. 
 But it seems that many investors have faith in the tech sector's Big Five and those company's respective leaders. 
 Bezos, Zuckerberg, Cook and Page have earned Wall Street's respect. So has Satya Nadella at Microsoft, who has pushed the company further into the cloud computing market as well as social networking with its purchase of LinkedIn. 
 "Higher quality tech companies continue to get bigger," said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. "The probability of any of these companies having a hiccup from our perspective seems small." 
 Bailey's firm owns stakes in Facebook and Alphabet. And he notes that, unlike in 2000, when tech stocks were trading at insane valuations, nearly all the big tech companies are reasonably valued. 
 Amazon is the main exception. But it's been trading at a high valuation for almost two decades. Any investors skeptical of Amazon have either missed the rally -- or lost lots of money betting against it. 
 "Tech is an area that should be more immune from regulation and politics than many others. And it is benefiting from genuine shifts in the economy," Wang said. 
 So it looks like Bezos will keep getting richer. But he'll have some company. Gates, Zuckerberg, Page and Brin may also see their bank accounts swell as the tech sector continues to surge.

 Mexico and the U.S. have fought for years over tuna. The U.S. insists that any Mexican tuna sold in the U.S. must be "dolphin safe," meaning dolphins weren't killed by tuna fisherman, which was once common. Mexico says its fisherman play by the rules. The U.S. government disagrees. 
 On Tuesday, the World Trade Organization ruled in Mexico's favor, allowing it to impose trade sanctions worth $163 million a year against the U.S. The WTO says that's how much money Mexico has lost from the U.S. unfairly penalizing Mexican tuna. 
 U.S. officials criticized the ruling. 
 "We are disappointed in the WTO Arbitrator's decision regarding U.S. dolphin-safe labeling standards," a spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative, a wing of the executive branch, said in a statement. 
 The Trump administration argues that the WTO ruling didn't take into account updated US laws on "dolphin safe" tuna, and that it overstated the actual financial loss to Mexican tuna producers, who the USTR accused of intentionally chasing and netting dolphins. 
 Trump's decision to go after Canada first with tariffs was particularly surprising given his harsh criticism of Mexico on the campaign trail. Now Trump has upset Canada and suffered a trade defeat from Mexico. 
 Mexican officials insisted for years that U.S. laws discriminated against their tuna, and that other countries didn't face the same level of enforcement. They argued that they have upheld international standards on commercial fishing and environmental preservation. 
 Tuesday's ruling by the WTO ends a case that was first filed by Mexico in 2008. 
 Mexico's economic ministry said it would immediately take actions to reclaim the $163 million the WTO said it had lost from the U.S. restrictions. It didn't say whether its retaliatory actions would be tariffs on U.S. tuna or another product.

 Reince Priebus, the president's chief of staff, said during an interview on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday that the White House has discussed potential changes to laws that are intended to safeguard free speech. 
 "How it gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story," Priebus said. But he added that he thinks "newspapers and news agencies need to be more responsible with how they report the news." 
 Changing the laws wouldn't be easy. Libel laws vary by state, and there's no federal libel law. And weakening press freedoms would likely take a constitutional amendment. 
 Trump and his administration have made attacks on the media a recurring part of his platform. Changing libel laws was even part of Trump's campaign trail rhetoric. 
 In February 2016, Trump said if he won the presidency he would "open up our libel laws so when (media) write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money." 
 Trump has frequently revisited the issue while attacking one of his favorite media targets -- The New York Times. 
 New York Times editor-in-chief Dean Baquet weighed in on Priebus's comments during CNN's "Reliable Sources" on Sunday, calling his remarks "dangerous." 
 He added that Trump is "making the media sort of the punching bag." 
 "We're supposed to be tough, we're supposed to ask him hard questions. I'm not sure he gets that," Baquet said. "The more he beats us up, to be frank, I think that's bad for the country. I think it's bad for the free flow of information and criticism." 
 CNN contributor Carl Bernstein, who broke the Watergate case as a reporter for the Washington Post, said Sunday on "Reliable" that Trump's recent tone toward the press has been "venomous." 
 Trump decried the mainstream media during a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania that he held to tout the accomplishments of his first 100 days in office. 
 "We have a president who doesn't understand the Constitution, who is ignorant of (the media's) history," Bernstein said. "He deserves our respect as the duly elected president of the United States. That does not mean he does not deserve to be called out when he lies."

 The legislation calls for providing refundable tax credits based on a person's age and income. It allows states to waive some protections for those with pre-existing conditions, while letting insurers charge higher rates to older consumers and levy a 30% surcharge on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse. 
 The bill also eliminates the enhanced federal match for Medicaid expansion starting in 2020 and curtails federal support for the entire Medicaid program, which covers about one in five Americans. And it lifts the taxes that Obamacare had imposed on the wealthy, insurers and companies. 
 Republican lawmakers and supporters say the bill will lower premiums and deductibles and give consumers more control over their health care. But an array of opponents, including many consumer and patient advocacy groups, say this bill could leave millions facing higher health care bills and less coverage. 
 Here's whom the American Health Care Act would likely help: 
 Obamacare was designed so that younger policyholders would help subsidize older ones. That would change under the Republican bill because it would allow insurers to charge older folks more. 
 Those under age 30 would also get a refundable tax credit of up to $2,000 to offset the cost of their premiums, as long as their income doesn't exceed $215,000 for an individual. 
 The GOP tax credits would also likely be more generous than Obamacare's subsidies for these folks. For example, a 27-year-old making $40,000 a year would receive $2,000 under the GOP plan, but only gets a $103 subsidy from Obamacare, on average, a Kaiser analysis found. 
 Also, the bill keeps the Obamacare provision that lets young adults up to age 26 stay on their parents' insurance plan. 
 Obamacare requires insurers to provide an array of health care benefits, including maternity, mental health, prescription drugs and substance abuse. This comprehensive coverage, however, jacks up premiums and provides services that some consumers find unnecessary -- think, a couple in their late 50s who aren't having any more kids likely don't need maternity coverage. 
 The bill would allow states to waive this federal mandate, which would allow insurers to offer skinnier plans that offer fewer benefits with lower premiums. 
 The Republicans would enable people higher on the income scale to claim the tax credit to help pay their premiums. Under Obamacare, an enrollee who makes more than $47,500 is no longer eligible for a premium subsidy. The GOP plan would let a policyholder making up to $75,000 claim the full tax credit. The benefit would phase out slowly until the enrollee hits $215,000 in income. 
 And the bill would allow folks to contribute more to Health Savings Accounts, which are primarily used by better-off Americans who can afford to sock money away for health care expenses. 
 Obamacare contains many provisions to help poor and lower-income Americans. 
 Primarily, it expanded Medicaid to cover adults who earn up to $16,400 a year. The American Health Care Act would end the enhanced federal Medicaid funding for new enrollees starting in 2020. And it would curtail federal support for the entire program by sending a fixed amount of money per enrollee or by providing a block grant. States would likely have to either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments. 
 All this could hurt not only poor adults, but also low-income children, women, senior citizens and the disabled. 
 Also, Obamacare provides those with incomes just under $30,000 with generous subsidies to lower their deductibles and out-of-pocket costs in individual market policies. The legislation would eliminate the subsidies. 
 Finally, the premium tax credits the legislation would provide would not go as far Obamacare's subsidies for lower-income consumers 
 Folks making $20,000 a year would take the biggest hit at any age under the GOP plan, a Kaiser study found. A 27-year-old earning this amount would only get $2,000, instead of $3,225 under Obamacare, on average. Meanwhile, a 40-year-old would get $3,000 versus nearly $4,150. However, the biggest loser would be a 60-year-old, who would receive only $4,000, instead of nearly $9,900 under Obamacare. 
 In its review of an early version of the bill, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 24 million fewer people would have coverage by 2026 as compared to current law. The majority of those would have qualified for Medicaid under Obamacare. 
 Major health insurance lobbying groups are concerned about the bill's impact on all these folks, many of whom are their customers. 
 "The American Health Care Act needs important improvements to better protect low- and moderate-income families who rely on Medicaid or buy their own coverage," Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, said after the bill passed the House Thursday. 
 Enrollees in their 50s and early 60s benefited from Obamacare because insurers could only charge them three times more than younger policyholders. The bill would widen that band to five-to-one. 
 That would mean that adults ages 60 to 64 would see their annual premiums soar 22% to nearly $18,000, according to the Milliman study for the AARP. Those in their 50s would be hit with a 13% increase and pay an annual premium of $12,800. 
 Also, the GOP bill doesn't provide them with as generous tax credits as Obamacare. A 60-year-old making $40,000 would get only $4,000 from the Republican plan, instead of an average subsidy of $6,750 from the Affordable Care Act, according the Kaiser study. 
 States could also receive waivers to allow insurers to charge older Americans even more than five times the premiums of the young. 
 Consumers with health issues may also find that their policies don't cover all of their needs. That's because states could allow insurers to offer skimpier plans. It's likely many carriers would take them up on that offer since few would want to sell policies that attract the sickest and costliest patients.
